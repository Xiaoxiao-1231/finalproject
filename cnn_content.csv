The world’s ice sheets are on course for runaway melting, leading to multiple feet of sea level rise and “catastrophic” migration away from coastlines, even if the world pulls off the miraculous and keeps global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to new research.
A group of international scientists set out to establish what a “safe limit” of warming would be for the survival of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. They pored over studies that took data from satellites, climate models and evidence from the past, from things like ice cores, deep-sea sediments and even octopus DNA.
What they found painted a dire picture.
The world has pledged to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
However, not only is this limit speeding out of reach — the world is currently on track for up to 2.9 degrees of warming by 2100. But the most alarming finding of the study, published Tuesday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, is that 1.5 might not even be good enough to save the ice sheets.
Even if the world sustains today’s level of warming, at 1.2 degrees, it could still trigger rapid ice sheet retreat and catastrophic sea level rise, the scientists found.
The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets together hold enough fresh water to raise global sea levels by around 213 feet — an unlikely scenario but one that must be acknowledged to fully understand the risk.
Since the 1990s, the amount of ice they’ve lost has quadrupled; they are currently losing around 370 billion tons a year. Ice sheet melting is the dominant contributor to rising seas and the rate of annual sea level rise has doubled over the past 30 years.
It’s set to get worse.
Multiple studies suggest 1.5 degrees of warming is “far too high” to prevent rapid ice sheet retreat that would be irreversible on human timescales, and the world should prepare for many feet of sea level rise over the coming centuries, according to the study.
“You don’t slow sea level rise at 1.5, in fact, you see quite a rapid acceleration,” said Chris Stokes, a study author and glaciologist at Durham University.
It’s an existential threat to the world’s coastal populations. Around 230 million people live less than 1 meter (3.2 feet) ﻿above sea level. Even small changes in the amount of ice held in the ice sheets will “profoundly alter” global coastlines, displacing hundreds of millions of people and causing damage that stretches the limits of adaptation, the study found.
Seas could surge by 0.4 inches a year by the end of the century, within the lifetimes of young people now, the scientists found.
At this level, which equates to 40 inches a century, “you’re going to see massive land migration on scales that we’ve never witnessed since modern civilization,” said Jonathan Bamber, a study author and glaciologist at the University of Bristol.
There are still huge uncertainties about where tipping points lie. The way climate change unfolds is not linear and it’s unclear exactly when warming might trigger rapid retreat and even collapse.
What’s hugely concerning, the study authors say, is that the best estimates of “safe” temperature thresholds for saving the ice sheets keep going down as scientists better understand their vulnerability to climate change.
Early modeling suggested temperatures would need to hit around 3 degrees of warming to destabilize the Greenland ice sheet, for example, but recent estimates suggest it would only take around 1.5 degrees.
To avoid the rapid collapse of one of more ice sheets means limiting global warming to closer to 1 degree above pre-industrial levels, the study authors concluded.
This would require drastic cuts to the amount of fossil fuels humans burn, something which looks exceptionally unlikely as countries including the US continue to embrace oil, coal and gas.
The world is already starting to see some of the worst-case scenarios play out in terms of ice loss, Stokes said.
“There’s very little that we’re observing that gives us hope here,” he said. “The absolute best-case scenario is that sea level rise is slow and steady,” he added.
The findings don’t mean the world should give up on climate targets, as every fraction of a degree of warming translates to worse impacts, Stokes said.
“Limiting warming to 1.5 will be a major achievement. It should absolutely be our target, but in no sense will it slow or stop sea level rise and melting ice sheets.”"
US heat risk forecast: See where Americans are at the most risk for extreme heat this year,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/26/weather/extreme-heat-risk-tracker-dg,"US heat risk forecast: See where Americans are at the most risk for extreme heat this year
High temperatures affect public health across wide swaths of the United States each summer, causing spikes in emergency room visits and hundreds of heat-related deaths. As temperatures rise, CNN is tracking extreme heat conditions and the potential risk for Americans each day.
To help prepare Americans for the dangerous temperatures, the National Weather Service and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a national forecast predicting heat-related risks.
It considers the severity and unusualness of forecast heat and its potential duration, while also factoring the likely impact on residents in specific locations based on CDC data for past effects, such as deaths.
This map shows the latest forecast.
A large slice of the American population lives in places that will be subject to heat advisories, warnings and watches from National Weather Service this year. More than 60 million people, on average, endured such conditions during summer 2023, according to data released by the service.
As the planet warms, heat waves are now more common, intense and long-lasting, and temperatures are warming even faster overnight — not cooling down enough to offer relief.
As those temperatures rise, heat records will also fall.
The weather service each day releases a forecast for potential record-breaking temperatures, by location, across the country. Here are places where high temperature records could be broken over the next three days.
Forecasters from the National Weather Service also try to predict average temperatures across regions of the country over the coming weeks. This map shows the chance that areas of the continental United States will be above, below or near normal average temperatures.
Darker shades represent areas where the average temperature has an increased chance of being warmer or cooler than usual. Gray areas are expected to be near normal.
Predictions often hold true, breaking daily high temperature records. This map highlights locations across the continental United States where temperatures exceeded calendar day records, according to the Southeastern Regional Climate Center."
Earth science societies take on US climate report after Trump administration dismisses researchers,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/climate/agu-ams-national-climate-assessment-trump,"Earth science societies take on US climate report after Trump administration dismisses researchers
Only days after the Trump administration dismissed authors of a congressionally mandated climate report, two of the biggest and most reputable Earth science societies announced they will pick up the slack and pursue a collection of reports in its place.
The announcement Friday morning from the American Geophysical Union and American Meteorological Society is a solicitation for authors to contribute scientific studies that would have gone into the Sixth National Climate Assessment.
The new research will be published in a special collection across 29 peer-reviewed research journals. The official assessment was on track to publish in 2028. It is unclear whether the administration will seek to publish an assessment with a different viewpoint.
“The new special collection does not replace the NCA but instead creates a mechanism for this important work to continue,” the AGU and AMS said in a joint statement.
The move is a pointed response to the administration’s actions to either abandon the NCA entirely or produce an alternate report downplaying the threat climate change poses to the United States, according to Brandon Jones, president of AGU.
The dismissals followed other attacks on climate science and efforts to defund climate research, Jones told CNN.
US weather forecasting is more crippled than previously known as hurricane season nears
He compared the special collection of studies to a library that will grow over time. “We’re responding in this collaborative way with a sibling society to stand up for science and maintain the missions that we hold dear as societal organizations,” Jones said.
Congress mandated the NCA to be produced every four years, with the next one due out by the end of Trump’s second term in office. The assessment provides detailed information on how the climate crisis is affecting the US in terms of extreme weather impacts, adaptation and mitigation options for the country as well as regions, states and localities.
The administration sent an email to about 400 of the report’s authors earlier this week, many of them located in academia, and told them their work was no longer needed as the assessment is being rethought."

The Trump administration has dismissed all the scientists and other authors working on the next authoritative look at how climate change is affecting the United States, according to an email sent to authors Monday and confirmed by CNN.
The move will allow the administration to either skip the congressionally mandated report altogether, or pursue an alternative, potentially far more skeptical take on what is otherwise widely accepted climate science. The latter would fly in the face of the overwhelming scientific evidence pointing to the threats global warming poses to the US.
The last National Climate Assessment came out in 2023. It found that climate change is already transforming every region of the country, with more frequent and intense extreme weather events and a slew of other costly and harmful effects.
During the first Trump administration, the Fourth Assessment came out after being worked on mainly under the Obama White House. Trump officials sought to deep-six the findings by publishing it the day after Thanksgiving.
Congress mandated these reports — conducted by a mix of federal and outside scientists under the US Global Change Research Program — be produced every four years. The next is due by 2027.
Before the dismissal of about 400 authors slated to work on the next iteration, NASA had already canceled a key contract with the consulting firm ICF to support the US Global Change Research Program, which produces the reports.
This was an early indication of trouble in the assessment process.
Climate scientists told CNN the reports are uniquely valuable for officials at the regional, state and local levels, and expressed concern over the potential for an alternative report featuring fringe scientific views.
“Losing this report makes us less prepared for extreme weather, wildfire, sea level rise and other important changes we face on a warming planet,” said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor at San Jose State University who was slated to be a contributing author to the sixth assessment report.
Meade Krosby, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, told CNN the reports are “A crucial resource for communities, local and state governments, and businesses asking how climate change is affecting the things they care about now and into the future, and what can be done to reduce risks.”
She said the reports’ credibility, as products of every federal agency that works on climate change, plus outside experts, give it valuable credibility.
“What’s at risk with this dismissal is not only the report itself, but its credibility if it moves forward without the experts that ensure its scientific integrity,” she said.
“Its loss or potential adulteration, if completed, would have real impact on the ability of our communities to understand and prepare for climate risks,” Krosby said. “It’s Congressionally mandated for a reason.”
There is more than just the assessment process that may be modified, though, as the website for the Global Change Research Program states: “The operations and structure of the USGCRP are currently under review.”"
How Pope Francis united a once-skeptical Church with climate action,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/europe/catholic-church-climate-pope-francis-intl/index.html,"How Pope Francis united a once-skeptical Church with climate action
Follow:
When Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected to lead the Catholic church in 2013, he chose the papal name Francis, after the 13th-century figure St. Francis of Assisi, known as the patron saint of ecologists and champion of the poor.
It was a befitting choice. Pope Francis was the fiercest climate and environment advocate in the church’s history.
The pope spoke often about the importance of environmental stewardship in a way none of his predecessors had, connecting climate change to social inequities, going so far as to blame industry, world leaders and “irresponsible” Western lifestyles for the worsening crisis.
In his landmark 2015 encyclical “Laudato Si’” on the “care for our common home,” Pope Francis was able to dissolve some of the long-standing tensions between the Catholic church and ecological science, eliminating room for climate denial in the church and bringing the Vatican into the world of international climate action.
In the encyclical, a kind of letter addressing the world’s more than 1 billion Catholics, the pontiff argued that Catholic values were aligned with climate change action. He drew points from the Bible, including the first book of Genesis, which outlines the creation of the Earth and how humans are tasked with keeping it safe and clean.
He argued that God gave humans the Earth to cultivate and protect, not to conquer and destroy, underscoring how the planet had suffered from human activities since it began rapidly burning fossil fuels to industrialize. “Never have we hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last 200 years,” he wrote.
The pope touched on a series of woes wreaking havoc on the planet: polluted air, water poverty, toxic waste, industrial pollution, rising sea levels and extreme weather.
“The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,” he wrote, using frank language. “In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish.”
The timing was crucial and intentional. Pope Francis pushed the Vatican to publish the encyclical early, so that it would play into the UN COP21 climate summit in Paris later that year. The pope was seen as highly influential in the landmark agreement eventually reached.
Although popes in the past had addressed issues like environmental destruction, Alberto Pallecchi, head of faith and sustainability at the non-profit World Resources Institute, told CNN that Pope Francis’ attention to climate change and the environment was “unprecedented for a pontiff,” with “its significance and reach unparalleled to any faith leader.”
“He has consistently put his moral authority on the line, pushing governments, the private sector, and rallying the global environmental faith-based movement,” Pallecchi said, in an interview conducted before Francis’ death.
He put “climate change firmly on the Catholic Church agenda,” he added.
In 2022, Vatican City, which is also a country, became party to the UN’s international climate framework, which presides over annual climate summits. And in the lead up to the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in 2023, the pope published an Apostolic exhortation, calling for binding action on climate.
The 12-page document was the pope’s strongest statement following the encyclical. In it, he blasted the greed and selfishness of the wealthy who consume the most, while emphasizing that the poor were the first victims of the climate crisis.
“The reality is that a low, richer percentage of the planet contaminates more than the poorest 50% of the total world population, and that per capita emissions for the richer countries are much greater than those of the poorest ones,” he wrote.
Other initiatives the pope pursued included publishing the Vatican’s first pledge to slash carbon emissions, and a plan to green the Vatican’s car fleet.
Many observers say the pope’s ability to link poverty and the climate crisis over the course of his papacy reflected the time he spent in the slums of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he was surrounded by hardship.
In 2018, the pope made his first visit to the Amazon in Peru, where he called on industry to end its destruction of the vast biome, saying that indigenous people there had “never been so threatened in their territories.”
“We have to break with the historical paradigm that views Amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants,” he said.
Despite the pope’s climate credentials, there are limits to what he was able to achieve. His advice for Catholic institutions around the world to divest from fossil fuels was taken by some, but many have resisted.
Pallecchi, for instance, said more could be done around the greening of physical and financial assets that contribute to a warming climate, including places of worship and schools, pension funds and endowments.
He also said the Catholic church could strongly influence “extractive projects that violate the rights of local communities and destroy ecosystems.”
Nonetheless, observers say the pope’s passion and influence on climate action will live on.
“Part of his legacy is that he’s ignited a movement of people around the globe, who now embrace care for creation as part of their faith,” Christina Leaño, associate director of the global Laudato Si’ Movement, told CNN.
“So even if he’s gone, we know that this will continue to live — that he’s created this new space and language for us as Christians to continue beyond his physical presence.”"
Trump administration minimized federal climate scientists’ findings of record CO2 growth,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/climate/noaa-co2-record/index.html,"Trump administration minimized federal climate scientists’ findings of record CO2 growth
The Trump administration quietly released key climate change data last week that has historically been accompanied by expert analysis from government scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, CNN has learned.
The lack of context minimized the government’s own findings that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide — the most abundant planet-warming gas in the air — jumped up by a record amount in 2024.
Instead of issuing a public-facing web story with an explanation of the annual measurement, as the agency has at this time of year for about a decade, NOAA public affairs officials scuttled those plans and instead released the new data on X and Facebook on April 14, sources at the agency told CNN. The social media posts link to NOAA’s CO2 data-tracking web page.
The episode, along with recent budget and staffing cuts, illustrates the Trump administration’s resistance to publicly distributing climate change-related data. The posts on X and Facebook, for example, did not call attention to the record-high rate of year-over-year increase in CO2 concentrations.
NOAA has also suspended monthly climate press calls during which scientists would discuss global temperatures and the reasons for particular trends. There is no indication NOAA limited its scientists’ ability to speak with the press about the annual CO2 data.
A NOAA spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment.
The Trump administration plans to dramatically scale back climate research. Based on a recent Trump administration budget proposal, the Colorado-based laboratory responsible for making and publicizing the CO2 measurements would be shut down, along with all other research labs across the agency.
Biggest CO2 jump
The new data, collected by the agency’s Global Monitoring Laboratory, showed that carbon dioxide, which is the longest-lived planet-warming gas, grew by 3.75 parts per million in 2024 — 25% larger than the previous record jump of 2.96 ppm, set in 2015.
The average concentration of CO2 in the lowest level of the atmosphere for 2024 was 422.7 ppm, the atmosphere and oceans agency found. Scientists cited record-high air and ocean temperatures as factors that pushed CO2 levels higher this year, at a faster rate.
Separately, researchers have found the world’s forests and lands may be absorbing less CO2 from the atmosphere compared to previous years, a potentially ominous development given continued record high global emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other human activities. The planet’s ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere into forests and oceans is one of the key reasons human-caused climate change hasn’t spiraled into an even bigger disaster.
At the start of the industrial revolution, atmospheric CO2 levels were just 280 ppm. When NOAA began calculating the globally averaged measurements in 1979, the average was about 337 ppm."

At most places Melissa Valliant goes when dining out, she carries in her backpack a set of reusable flatware — prepared to refuse the disposable utensils she says are part of the plastic pollution crisis that’s inextricably linked with the climate crisis.
Plastic is made from chemicals derived from fossil fuels, the burning of which drive the climate crisis by producing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Disposable flatware, in particular, is typically produced from a rigid plastic called polystyrene, which is made from a byproduct of petroleum.
“Plastic is contributing to climate change at every stage of its life cycle,” said Valliant, communications director at Beyond Plastics, a nationwide project that works to end plastic pollution and is based at Bennington College in Vermont.
“Plastic production, specifically, is warming the planet four times faster than air travel,” Valliant said. “In addition to its climate impact, it’s also contributing to air and water pollution during the drilling and fracking process and toxic emissions that come out of the plastic production plant.”
Additionally, the life cycle of plastics contributes to environmental injustice, as plastics tend to be both manufactured and disposed of in lower-income communities and communities of color, Valliant said. The resulting pollutants have led to a higher rate of cancer in those areas.
Processing crude oil also requires a significant amount of energy, Dr. Jillian Goldfarb, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Cornell University in New York state, said via email. “A typical refinery will use about 1.5 barrels of water for each barrel of oil it processes,” Goldfarb, a fellow of the American Chemical Society, said.
The impact of opting for reusable flatware
Some reports estimate that potentially between 36 billion and 40 billion plastic utensils are used every year just in the United States, which is more than 100 million per day, Valliant said.
You might think recycling plastic flatware may offset the harms of using it. But as of 2018, only 9% of all the plastic the world has ever produced — around 9 billion metric tons or nearly 10 billion US tons — had been recycled, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme.
This means most of the rest ends up in landfills, and the intentional durability of plastics means “the fork you (ate) lunch with today could be taking up space in a landfill for the next 500 years,” Goldfarb said.
“In landfills, plastic utensils are weakened by mechanical forces like the friction of moving and being compressed among literally tons of trash, as well as biological and chemical means, like the bacteria present in landfills and corrosive chemicals,” Goldfarb said. “While this does little to degrade the utensils in a meaningful time frame, it does lead to the release of more microplastics, which can travel with leachate and can eventually contaminate groundwater supplies.”
What isn’t recycled or thrown away is burned or littered, experts said. Burning plastic utensils releases carbon dioxide into the environment, Goldfarb said, and an incinerator that isn’t at peak performance can release particulate matter and carbon monoxide.
However, emissions of these pollutants from burning are typically low when compared with those from landfills, according to reports by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The agency monitors air emissions and has standards for pollutants, Goldfarb said.
The production process for plastics has a significantly worse impact on the environment than individuals’ use of them does, which is “just another reason why waste management solutions for single-use plastic and plastic in general are not going to significantly curb this crisis,” Valliant said. “We actually need to stop pollution at the source, which means cutting back on the production and use of plastic from the get-go.”
To limit your use of plastic flatware, you could switch to compostable, bamboo or metal options, all of which generally require or produce significantly less energy, water, waste or emissions, Goldfarb said. Producing a pound of bamboo forks, for example, expends 0.46 kilowatts per hour, whereas making a pound of plastic forks expends 11 kilowatts per hour, according to Goldfarb. (Manufacturing metal utensils, however, does require more water than plastic utensils.)
But you don’t have to buy a reusable set from a trendy environmental store — you can just use what you already have, Valliant said. And if a plastic fork weighs about 5 grams, our landfills would be spared roughly 200,000 tons of single-use plastic utensils, “a weight equivalent to 889 Statues of Liberty,” Valliant added.
To put into perspective the savings on electricity use, Goldfarb said, switching from plastic forks to metal “could save enough energy to charge your iPhone once a day for five years.”
“In the sea of plastic waste we create each year, one person switching to reusable silverware is unlikely to alter the global environmental impacts of plastic utensils on a climate-mitigation scale,” Goldfarb said. “Yet this person’s action — if shared and discussed with others — can form the basis for a community of change.
“Across the country, states and municipalities are banning single-use plastics (including utensils) in growing numbers,” Goldfarb added. “These collective actions could have very meaningful impacts.”
Additionally, by reducing your share of plastic waste and its impact on pollution and the climate crisis, you would also be lowering the odds of microplastics residing in your body, experts said — a phenomenon increasingly detected by recent research. Studies have found microplastics in human blood, lungs, placentas, brains and testicles.
“This is really concerning, because a lot of these chemicals are associated with cancer, hormone disruption, diabetes, fertility issues — the more we learn, the scarier it gets,” Valliant said. “We should be reducing our exposure to it, which is why it’s so important for policymakers to force companies to do so.”

Follow:
For hundreds of millions of people living in India and Pakistan the early arrival of summer heatwaves has become a terrifying reality that’s testing survivability limits and putting enormous strain on energy supplies, vital crops and livelihoods.
Both countries experience heatwaves during the summer months of May and June, but this year’s heatwave season has arrived sooner than usual and is predicted to last longer too.
Temperatures are expected to climb to dangerous levels in both countries this week.
Parts of Pakistan are likely to experience heat up to 8 degrees Celsius above normal between April 14-18, according to the country’s meteorological department. Maximum temperatures in Balochistan, in country’s southwest, could reach up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit).
That’s like living in Death Valley – the hottest and driest place in North America – where summer daytime temperatures often climb to similar levels.
Ayoub Khosa, who lives in Balochistan’s Dera Murad Jamali city, said the heatwave had arrived with an “intensity that caught many off guard,” creating severe challenges for its residents.
“One of the major issues is the persistent power outages,” said Khosa, who told CNN they could last for up to 16 hours a day.
“This has intensified the impact of the heat, making it harder for people to cope,” he said.
Neighboring India has also been experiencing extreme heat that arrived earlier than usual and its metrological department warned people in parts of the country to brace for an “above-normal number of heatwave days” in April.
Maximum temperatures in capital Delhi, a city of more than 16 million, have already crossed 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) at least three times this month – up to 5 degrees above the seasonal average – the meteorological department said.
The searing heat is being faced in several neighboring states too, including Rajasthan in the northwest, where laborers and farmers are struggling to cope and reports of illness are beginning to emerge.
Maximum recorded temperatures in parts of Rajasthan reached 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) on Monday, according to the meteorological department.
Anita Soni, from the women’s group Thar Mahila Sansthan, said the heat is much worse than other years and she is worried about how it will impact children and women in the state.
When the laborers or farmers head out, there is an instant lack of drinking water, people often feel like vomiting, they fall sick, or they feel dizzy, she said.
Farmer Balu Lal said people are already falling sick due to working in it. “We cannot even stand to work in it,” he said. “When I am out, I feel that people would burn due to the heat outside.”
Lal said he worries about his work and how he will earn money for his family. “We have nowhere else to go,” he said.
Testing survivability limits
Experts say the rising temperatures are testing human limits.
Extreme heat has killed tens of thousands of people in India and Pakistan in recent decades and climate experts have warned that by 2050 India will be among the first places where temperatures will cross survivability limits.
Under heatwave conditions, pregnant women and their unborn children are particularly at risk. “There is unexplained pregnancy loss and early babies,” said Neha Mankani, an advisor at the International Confederation of Midwives in Karachi.
“In the summers, 80% of babies are born preterm with respiratory issues because of the weather. We also see an increase in pregnancy induced hypertension, (which could) lead to preeclampsia – the leading cause of maternal mortality.”
India and Pakistan, both countries with glaring disparities in development, are expected to be among the nations worst affected by the climate crisis – with more than 1 billion people predicted to be impacted on the subcontinent.
The cascading effects will be devastating. Likely consequences range from a lack of food and drought to flash floods from melting ice caps, according to Mehrunissa Malik, a climate change and sustainability expert from Pakistan’s capital Islamabad.
Communities without access to cooling measures, adequate housing and those who rely on the elements for their livelihoods will feel the effects much more acutely, said Malik.
“For farmers, the weather is erratic and difficult to predict,” she said. “The main challenge is the fact that temperatures (are) rising at a time when crops aren’t at the stage to be harvested. They start getting ready earlier, yields get lower, and in this dry heat they need more water… If your plants are still young, severe heat causes little chance of them making it.”
Tofiq Pasha, a farmer and environmental activist from Karachi, said summers begin much earlier now.
His home province, Sindh, which, along with Balochistan, has recorded some of the hottest global temperatures in recent years, suffered a major drought during the winter months and the little rainfall has led to water shortages, he said.
“This is going to be a major livelihood issue among farmers,” Pasha said, explaining how temperatures also affect the arrival of pests. “Flowers don’t set, they fall, fruits don’t set, they fall, you have pest attacks, they decimate the crop, sometimes it gets too hot… the cycles are messed. Food production is extremely affected.”
Heatwaves have in the past have increased demand for electricity, leading to coal shortages while leaving millions without power. Trains have been cancelled to conserve energy, and schools have been forced shut, impacting learning.

What month is it? Temperatures plunge to winter-like chill in East while big heat looms for West,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/weather/cold-snap-east-heat-west/index.html,"What month is it? Temperatures plunge to winter-like chill in East while big heat looms for West
After more than a week of deadly severe thunderstorms and flooding, winter is making an unwelcome return for tens of millions in the eastern half of the United States. Meanwhile, the West is gearing up for a taste of summer.
Temperatures from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast dipped to levels more appropriate for the first days of March Monday morning and will come crashing down to February-like levels by Tuesday morning.
That’s bad news for millions of people in the central and southern US dealing with active flooding and those trying to clean up in the aftermath.
“If you’re somewhere that’s very wet, if you’re trying to ride this out in a home that’s had water, tonight could raise concerns of hypothermia,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear warned during a Monday press conference.
Days of storms have sent parts of Kentucky underwater after more than a foot of rain fell in the state. Much of the state will drop below freezing by early Tuesday morning and some northern parts of the will plunge into the mid-20s.
“Find a safe place to go,” Beshear continued. “We need you to be dry and warm.”
Kentucky isn’t the only place going toe-to-toe with winter conditions. Low temperatures could drop to near-freezing in Tennessee with 40s possible from Texas through the Southeast Tuesday morning.
High temperatures in hard-hit areas of Kentucky, Tennessee and northeastern Arkansas will struggle to reach the 50s Tuesday, adding more chilly misery to the cleanup process.
February cold will also extend all the way to the Canadian border. Temperatures will barely top the freezing mark in Buffalo while high elevation areas of New York and New England could be stuck in the 20s Tuesday afternoon. Some snow is also possible in these areas.
Temperatures will climb a few degrees higher Wednesday and Thursday — especially in the South – but this late-winter or early spring chill will linger for many through at least Saturday.
The complete opposite is expected in the West where summer heat will build in tandem with the East’s return to winter. It’s all thanks to a dramatic pattern shift in the atmosphere that’s sending cold, Canadian air to the East while hot air surges north out of Mexico in the West.
Temperatures will start to climb early this week in parts of the West and, by midweek, it will feel like late spring from California through the Rockies.
Phoenix could hit 100 degrees for the first time this year Thursday. That’s a milestone that typically doesn’t happen until early May. The city could soar higher and land in the low 100s on Friday — a high that’s much more at home in June than April.
Thursday and Friday will offer Las Vegas two chances to hit 95 degrees for the first time this year. Like Phoenix, that’s a threshold that isn’t usually crossed until May and a June-like high temperature.

It’s only spring, but some weather forecasters are already focusing on this year’s Atlantic hurricane season.
The season, which spans June through November, is shaping up to be a busy one, according to hurricane researchers at Colorado State University.
CSU’s team of experts is calling for an above-average hurricane season consisting of 17 named storms with sustained winds of at least 39 mph. They expect nine storms will become hurricanes and four will strengthen into major hurricanes — Category 3 or stronger.
This year’s outlook isn’t quite as bullish as last year’s spot-on prediction of 11 hurricanes, but it is significant. The forecast of nine hurricanes is tied for the second-highest amount predicted in the 30 years the team has issued long-range hurricane forecasts in April.
CSU has called for nine hurricanes in their longest-range report  seven other times, most recently in 2022 and 2024, according to Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at CSU and the lead author of the hurricane forecast.
The busy forecast signals that experts think atmospheric and oceanic factors will align to facilitate plenty of storm development months from now. But sometimes the atmosphere doesn’t play ball.
Historically, CSU’s first forecast of the year has the “lowest level of skill” because large changes can occur in the atmosphere or ocean between April and when hurricane season’s peak begins in August, the team caveated in a release.
“The CSU forecast is intended to provide a best estimate of activity in the Atlantic during the upcoming season — not an exact measure,” the team added.
CSU has about their typical level of confidence in 2025’s early forecast, compared to the above-average confidence they had in last year’s, according to Klotzbach.
“Last year, pretty much all forecast factors were pointing towards a hyperactive season, while this season, the climate signals are more of a mixed bag,” Klotzbach said.
The busy forecast hinges on a few factors
The “mixed bag” Klotzbach mentioned includes abnormally warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea as well as the possible — but improbable — return of El Niño.
Warm oceans support stronger storms while El Niño’s influence has been shown to tamp down tropical activity in the Atlantic — though that wasn’t the case in 2023.
Currently, weak La Niña conditions are in effect in the tropical Pacific Ocean, according to the Climate Prediction Center. La Niña and El Niño are the cool and warm phase, respectively, of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a natural climate pattern driven by the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean that influences weather worldwide.
Hurricane activity can be closely tied to what’s happening with ENSO, which is usually predictable well in advance.
For this hurricane season, ENSO is most likely going to be in its so-called neutral phase — neither El Niño nor La Niña. There’s an only about a 13% chance El Niño emerges during the peak of the season, mid-August through mid-October, according to the Climate Prediction Center.
So, without El Niño’s potential storm-suppressing influence, more storms are fair game.
But warm oceans are the biggest factor driving the CSU team’s above-average prediction this year. Parts of the Atlantic are still quite warm after hitting record-high temperatures during long stretches of 2023 and 2024. These areas will only get warmer as the hottest months of the year in the Northern Hemisphere approach, opening the door to storm formation.
“A warm Atlantic favors an above-average season, since a hurricane’s fuel source is warm ocean water,” CSU’s release explained. “Additionally, a warm Atlantic leads to lower atmospheric pressure and a more unstable atmosphere. Both conditions favor hurricane formation.”
Planet-warming fossil fuel pollution is tipping the scales toward hotter oceans that fuel dangerous storms. Scientists say unusually warm oceans will likely lead to more instances of storms rapidly intensifying, which nine of last year’s hurricanes did, including Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton.
In the most extreme cases of rapid intensification, which is when a storm’s wind speed increases considerably in a short period, a hurricane could be a Category 1 at one moment and explode into a Category 5 monster just 24 hours later.
That’s exactly what Milton did before it approached the United States in October. Rapid intensification remains a major forecasting challenge as underestimating its potential gives communities little time to prepare for a much larger threat.
A warmer atmosphere is also capable of soaking up more moisture like a sponge and wringing it out in the form of gushing rainfall, increasing flooding risks from tropical storms and hurricanes. Helene’s deadly flooding literally changed the landscape of western North Carolina forever.
Flooding from rainfall recently overtook storm surge as the deadliest aspect of tropical systems, according to a study from the National Hurricane Center."

This startup wants to green the desert using microalgae and agricultural waste
Follow:
It’s hard to green the desert. Take China, or Africa’s Sahel region, for example. Their “Great Green Walls,” grand projects to beat back encroaching desert by planting trees, have required decades of slog, innumerable saplings and billions of dollars – and even then, critics have questioned how sustainable these solutions are.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is 80% desert. Only 0.7% of land is arable and it imports more than 90% of its food. Unsurprisingly, the oil-rich nation has proved fertile ground for companies aiming to change those statistics, as the UAE attempts to innovate its way toward food security.
HyveGeo, with operations in Cambridge, England, and in Abu Dhabi, is the latest startup that thinks it has found a way to turn the desert green while turning a profit too.
Using agricultural waste and algae, the company is creating a fertile mixture designed to boost plant growth for tree planting projects and food production, reviving desert and other non-arable land. And through growing algae, it says it can remove climate-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the process.
“Our model can solve multiple problems at the same time,” explained Dr. Samsurin Welch, HyveGeo chief operations officer and director of research. “There’s a carbon problem, there’s a food security problem, and we can kill two birds with one stone.”
Carbon credits
The main ingredient for HyveGeo’s product is biochar, a carbon-rich, charcoal-like material made by burning organic materials in a low-oxygen environment in a process known as pyrolysis.
HyveGeo is sourcing its organic material from local date palm farms and other agricultural waste, and processing it at a pilot site in Abu Dhabi. To date, the site has produced 200 tons of biochar, diverting 800 tons of waste from landfill, said company founder Abdulaziz bin Redha. But those figures could soon be dwarfed by its first commercial facility, scheduled to open in mid-2026 and capable of processing 40,000 tons of biomass per year.
HyveGeo is selling carbon credits against its biochar, allowing companies to offset their carbon footprint. When HyveGeo enters commercial production, it plans to sell its biochar to the agricultural sector, improving soil health while sequestering carbon for hundreds of years
But the material has its limitations. “Biochar itself is fantastic, but if you stick it in desert sand it doesn’t do that much. Desert sand is desert sand; you need to add more to it,” explained Welch.
To green the desert, HyveGeo has turned to microalgae.
Algae absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide and emit oxygen via photosynthesis, and have been doing so since before the first land plants ever existed. Cultivating microalgae for carbon drawdown has taken off in recent years. One company, Brilliant Planet, has proposed growing it on the fringes of the Sahara Desert in Morocco, then burying it. Others have trialled it as a biofuel. A German designer even proposed vitamin and mineral rich microalgae could be the next big thing in high-end gastronomy.
HyveGeo first experimented with turning microalgae into biochar, before realizing it was “like growing saffron and burning it,” according to Redha. Instead, the company now puts microalgae through what it calls a “biorefinery concept,” extracting bioactive compounds. These compounds act as biostimulants or natural fertilizers, and can be added along with beneficial microbes to biochar in different recipes to promote the growth of specific crops. Another, more general-purpose formula, could be used for creating forests or grassland.
“Effectively, what we’re doing is accelerating soil creation from something that could take five years down to just less than a month,” said bin Redha.
Creating healthy soil
According to the UN, at least 100 million hectares of healthy land is lost globally every year through land degradation. To put that figure in context, between 2015 and 2019, that area amounted to roughly double the size of Greenland.
HyveGeo is testing its product on crops including tomatoes. Compared to a control environment, “the plants are bushier, bigger,” said bin Redha, adding that the plants flowered and fruited at higher temperatures than tomatoes regularly permit, and grew outside in temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) – indicators that the growing medium helped combat climate stressors.
HyveGeo’s biochar soil solution is being trialed in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Food and Agricultural Safety Authority and Silal Innovation Oasis, both in the UAE.
Bin Redha said HyveGeo’s product could be used to grow staple crops in the UAE like cowpea, millet, wheat and rice, as well as leafy greens and fruit and vegetables.
Dr. Marcella Fernandes de Souza, a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University, in Belgium, and an expert in algae biotechnology, who is not involved with HyveGeo, told CNN in an email that “it seems they (HyveGeo) are covering all bases to make the soil arable.
“However,” she continued, “soil dynamics are very complex and it can take some time for the soil to fully regenerate and regain its health, so I do not know what time frame would be realistic to fully recover this soil.”
She also questioned the irrigation requirements for crop cultivation in desert regions.
Scaling up
Producing enough microalgae to meet demand and make HyveGeo’s model commercially viable are just two of many challenges the startup faces.
“It’s really difficult,” bin Redha conceded. “We have seen startups that are very well funded and have been running for 15 years and unfortunately gone into administration (growing microalgae) in the desert.
“It’s about finding a way to grow at scale at a cost-effective way – and I think we’re very, very close to cracking that.”
One positive is the location of HyveGeo’s operation. Dr. de Souza noted that algae farms “need to focus on locations with large available land and good weather and sun irradiation” – three elements the UAE has in abundance.
HyveGeo will announce its next round of venture capital funding this summer, and has entered into partnership with a state-owned company on its commercial biochar processing site.
Long term, Redha says he wants the company to export its model worldwide through licensing deals in places with desert and degenerated land. HyveGeo’s goal is to regenerate 10,000 hectares of land and remove 1 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2035.
“Climate is a long-term thing and climate is apolitical,” added Welch. “We have a big challenge to solve, and if we can do our bit to solve the problem, that’s a wonderful thing.”

China’s glacier area shrinks by 26% over six decades due to global warming,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/china/china-glacier-shrinking-global-warming-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"China’s glacier area shrinks by 26% over six decades due to global warming
Follow:
China’s glacier area has shrunk by 26% since 1960 due to rapid global warming, with 7,000 small glaciers disappearing completely and glacial retreat intensifying in recent years, official data released in March showed.
Glaciers around the globe are disappearing faster than ever, with the largest glacial mass loss on record taking place in the last three years, according to a UNESCO report.
As the important water towers continue to shrink, less availability of freshwater is expected to contribute to greater competition for water resources, environmental groups have warned. Glacier retreat also poses new disaster risks.
China’s glaciers are located mainly in the west and north of the country, in the regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, and the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai.
Data published on March 21 on the website of the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, showed that China’s total glacier area was around 46,000 square kilometers, with around 69,000 glaciers in 2020.
This compares to around 59,000 square kilometers and around 46,000 glaciers in China between 1960 and 1980, the study showed.
To save its melting glaciers, China has used technology including snow blankets and artificial snow systems, to delay the melting process.
The Tibetan plateau is known as the world’s Third Pole for the amount of ice long locked in the high-altitude wilderness.
The dramatic ice loss, from the Arctic to the Alps, from South America to the Tibetan Plateau, is expected to accelerate as climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, pushes global temperatures higher.
This would likely exacerbate economic, environmental and social problems across the world as sea levels rise and these key water sources dwindle, the UNESCO report said."
NIH ends future funding to study the health effects of climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/nih-climate-change-funding-propublica/index.html,"NIH ends future funding to study the health effects of climate change

This story was originally published on ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive their biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
The National Institutes of Health will no longer be funding work on the health effects of climate change, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.
The guidance, which was distributed to several staffers last week, comes on the back of multiple new directives to cut off NIH funding to grants that are focused on subjects that are viewed as conflicting with the Trump administration’s priorities, such as gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues, vaccine hesitancy, and diversity, equity and inclusion.
While it’s unclear whether the climate guidance will impact active grants and lead to funding terminations, the directive appears to halt opportunities for future funding of studies or academic programs focused on the health effects of climate change.
“This is an administration where industry voices rule and prevail,” said Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director of The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, a coalition of medical professionals that raises awareness about the health effects of climate change. “This is an agenda item for the fossil fuel industry, and this administration is doing what the fossil fuel industry wants.”
She called the new guidance “catastrophic” and said it would have a “devastating” impact on much-needed research.
As extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires and floods, continue to intensify and become more frequent, researchers are increasingly examining the impact climate change has on public health. The NIH, which provides billions of dollars annually for biomedical research across the country, has funded hundreds of grants and programs in recent years devoted to researching this issue.
In 2021, under President Joe Biden, the agency launched the Climate Change and Health Initiative to further coordinate and encourage greater research and training. The initiative received $40 million in congressional appropriations for research in both 2023 and 2024. However, last month, the initiative and two other similar NIH programs devoted to climate change and health were dismantled, according to reporting from Mother Jones.
The latest directive cuts all future climate change and health funding across the agency, regardless of its connection to the previously canceled initiative.
In response to ProPublica’s questions about the directive, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the agency “is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.”

How does climate change impact health and wellness?
“At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science,” the spokesperson said. “As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
Climate and health researchers faced hostility during President Donald Trump’s first administration but were able to continue their work, according to Linda Birnbaum, a former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences who served as a federal scientist for four decades.
“Under Trump One, we scratched the word ‘change’ from our work and talked about ‘climate’ and ‘health,’ and that was acceptable,” she said. “If NIH doesn’t study the health impacts of climate, we are not going to be able to prevent some of those health impacts, and we aren’t going to be able to find ways to deal with them.”
In a report from December, the NIH listed numerous ongoing climate change and health projects that it was funding, including research to examine the health impacts of the Maui wildfires in Hawaii, develop models to predict dengue virus transmission by mosquitos, and study the effect of heat on fertility and reproductive functions. The Trump administration has since pulled the report offline.
“We can see with our own eyes how extreme heat and extreme weather are harming people’s health,” said Veena Singla, an adjunct assistant professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.
The new NIH directive follows the Trump administration’s broader agenda to gut efforts to document and address climate change. Trump has paused billions of dollars of spending on climate-related causes. He has also issued executive orders aimed at increasing the production of fossil fuels and scaling back the government’s efforts to address climate change.
His administration is also considering a plan to eliminate the scientific research office of the Environmental Protection Agency, which could result in the firing of more than 1,000 scientists, according to The New York Times. Some scientists in that office have also been researching the health effects of climate change, investigating such questions as how rising temperatures might change the body’s response to air pollution and how climate change impacts the amount of toxic chemicals in air and water.
The NIH and White House did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment. The EPA did not answer questions about whether research on climate change and health will continue at the agency. In an emailed response to questions from ProPublica, the EPA press office wrote that “The Trump EPA is dedicated to being led by our commitment to the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, unlike Biden EPA appointees with major ethical issues that were beholden to radical stakeholder groups.”
Trump’s perspective on climate change appears to be at odds with that of his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who spent decades as an environmental attorney. “I believe the climate crisis is real, that humans are causing it, that it’s existential,” he said in an interview last year. HHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions on the secretary’s views.
However, Patel told ProPublica that she did not expect the new health secretary, whose mandate oversees the NIH, to support views that were at odds with the administration’s agenda.
“What we can readily see, from the things that RFK Jr. is allowing to happen and unwilling to weigh in on, he is not going to be an anti-industry voice,” she said. “He is not there to follow the best science.”"

Welcome to the Age of Adaptation, when a growing number of people are coming to realize that the Big, Bad Climate Wolf isn’t going away — and is only getting stronger.
As the children’s story warns, many homeowners will learn the hard way that their shelter is no match for the huffs and puffs, or floods and fires of an overheating planet, so we must take inspiration from the Third Little Pig, who built a house so strong, it became shelter for the others — and a base of wolf eradication.
When my little boy was born in 2020, that old story took on new relevance every time I’d kiss him goodbye to go cover another unnatural disaster. I wondered: Where should he live? What kind of building? What about air and water? What kind of community has the best chance to survive and thrive, come what may?
The result is “Adaptation Nation: A Climate Crisis Survival Guide,” my global search for the most promising solutions and most resilient communities.
Outside Amsterdam, I strolled the floating Schoonschip neighborhood, which is pioneering innovative ways to live on top of water as sea levels rise. In Florida, I met the NFL wife and mom who was so shaken by her first hurricane, she started an innovative construction company to build disaster-proof domiciles on the Gulf Coast.
As urban wildfires ravaged Los Angeles County, I focused on the homes that didn’t burn. I called up the architect for design tips, and we kept going back to Paradise, California, to learn from survivors five years after the Camp Fire turned most of their mountain town to ash.
And in Babcock Ranch, Florida, I leaned what it took to build America’s first solar-powered town and how it has survived two major hurricanes without flooding or losing power.
On journeys from London to Silicon Valley, I met dozens of brilliant innovators devoted to rebuilding healthier, wealthier and happier communities from every sector, like the “fix-a-flat” for leaky homes that can cut heating bills in half and the van-size drones that could move supply chains from the roads to the sky.
Since solar and wind energy now cost less than oil and gas, some Democrats think the way to beat Big Oil is by building better, faster, cheaper alternatives, which just happen to be cleaner and stronger.

Can blue cities and states, nonprofits and good-hearted corporations keep up the fight without any federal help? It’s too soon to tell, and before we know it, my son’s Generation Alpha will be old enough to tally what’s left and wonder what could have been.

The world has just experienced its hottest decade,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/climate/wmo-state-of-climate-report-2024-intl-hnk/index.html,"The world has just experienced its hottest decade
Follow:
A report considered the world’s most trusted source of climate updates has laid out the parlous state of a planet that has recorded its 10 hottest years over the last decade.
The World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Global Climate report lists alarming records that scientists say should shock the world into taking drastic action – but they warn they probably won’t, given the lack of urgency displayed by global leaders to date.
The report found the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide – as well as methane and nitrous oxide – are at the highest levels in the last 800,000 years.
Here are the report’s main findings:
2024 set a new heat record
Last year was confirmed to be the hottest since records began 175 years ago, beating the previous record set in 2023.
And 2024 was likely to be the first time global temperatures exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above the baseline set in 1850-1900, according to the WMO.
Scientists say that doesn’t mean that we’ve permanently crossed global limits set under the Paris Agreement – which the United States left on the first day of President Donald Trump’s second term – but we’re getting close.
Record levels of greenhouse gases were mostly to blame for higher temperatures, aided by a short-term boost from El Niño, a weather pattern that creates warmer water in the eastern Pacific, the report said.
Long-term global warming is estimated to be between 1.34 and 1.41 degrees Celsius up on the pre-industrial era, the WMO said.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius was still possible, but “leaders must step up to make it happen.”
Each of the past eight years set a record for ocean heat
Rising global temperatures inevitably mean warmer water, as oceans absorb 90% of the surplus heat.
New heat records have been set for each of the last eight years, and the rate of ocean warming over the past two decades is more than twice that recorded from 1950 to 2005.
Warm water has caused severe bleaching of coral reefs over the past year, fueled tropical and subtropical storms and exacerbated the loss of sea ice.
The rate of sea-level rise has doubled since satellite measurements began
The rate of global mean sea-level rise has doubled since the first satellite record in 1993, to reach a record high in 2024, the report said.
The rise of 2.1 millimeters per year recorded between 1993 and 2002 has been dwarfed by a 4.7-millimeter increase between 2015 and 2024.
Higher sea levels have knock-on effects for coastal communities, including flooding, erosion and the salinization of groundwater.
Sea-level rise is exacerbated by sea ice melt, and there’s no sign that’s slowing. The three years since 2021 brought the biggest three-year loss of Glacier mass on record.
“Exceptionally negative” losses were recorded in Norway, Sweden, Svalbard and the tropical Andes, the WMO said.
2024 saw the most people displaced due to climate impacts in 16 years
Tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and other hazards in 2024 displaced the highest number of people since 2008, when 36 million people were forced from their homes.
That year, around half – 15 million – were displaced in China after the Sichuan earthquake. Flooding also affected millions in India.
In 2024, tropical cyclones and hurricanes brought destructive winds, severe rain and flooding. Dozens of unprecedent heatwaves were recorded including in Saudi Arabia where temperatures reached 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the Hajj pilgrimage.
Wildfires and severe drought also raged through some countries, displacing people and disrupting food supplies. In eight countries, at least one million more people faced acute food insecurity compared with 2023, the WMO said.
Some of the turmoil could have been avoided with early-warning systems, though in parts of the world most vulnerable to climate impacts, there’s very little advance notice of disaster.
“Only half of all countries worldwide have adequate early-warning systems. This must change,” said Celeste Saulo, WMO secretary-general.
What scientists say
Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a professor at the Australian National University’s Fenner School of Environment and Society, said the world had reached a point where net zero emissions were no longer enough.
“We need to stop hitting snooze on our alarm, which is the now regularly occurring record-breaking global temperatures,” she said. “How much more do we need to scream and shout that climate change is happening, it’s because of us, and without any serious action, it’s only going to get worse? The longer this goes in, the harder it will be to make things better.”
Linden Ashcroft, a lecturer in climate science at The University of Melbourne, said not enough attention had been paid to warnings.
“Honestly, I’m not quite sure what to do next. Scream these findings from the tops of buildings? Write my comments in capitals? Saying all this while dancing on TikTok?” she said in a written statement.
“Unless we see real climate leadership from governments and businesses, I will save this response and send it through again next year.”"
The Arctic is in trouble. The consequences will be felt around the world,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/climate/arctic-sea-ice-heat-downward-spiral/index.html,"The Arctic is in trouble. The consequences will be felt around the world
The Arctic has long filled humans with awe, but there are now profoundly worrying signals coming from the frozen landscape at the top of our planet, and scientists are deeply concerned about its future as the Trump administration pulls the US out of global climate strategy and guts its science agencies.
Last month was extreme: Temperatures in parts of the Arctic spiked 36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 20 Celsius, above normal. By the end of the month, sea ice was at its lowest level ever recorded for February, marking the third straight month of record lows.
This follows a year of concerning signs from the region, including intense wildfires and thawing permafrost pumping out planet-heating pollution.
It paints a grim picture of a region that’s been in rapid decline for the last two decades as humans continue to burn fossil fuels. The Arctic now exists within a “new regime,” where signals such as sea ice loss and ocean temperatures may not always break records, but are consistently more extreme compared to the past, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its annual health check of the region published in December.
It’s a problem with global consequences. The Arctic plays a vital role in global temperatures and weather systems. It’s “sort of like our planetary air conditioning system,” said Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Its decline accelerates global warming, increases sea level rise and helps to drive more extreme weather.
The Arctic is the early warning system for climate change and the loss of sea ice is a clear sign it’s in trouble, scientists say. It should be reaching its annual maximum levels of ice at this time of year, but instead it’s experiencing record lows.
“I hope that these three months do not act as a precursor to a potential new all-time minimum this summer, because the starting point to the melting season is not good,” said Mika Rantanen, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Arctic sea ice bottoms out at the end of summer in September. The last 18 years have seen the lowest sea ice levels on record, a downward spiral that will continue, scientists say.
The Arctic will be ice-free in the summer at some point by 2050, even if humans stop pumping out climate pollution, according to a report co-authored by Dirk Notz, head of sea ice at the University of Hamburg. “It’s basically too late to prevent that,” he told CNN.
The first ice-free day could even happen before the end of this decade, according to a separate study published in December.
Sea ice loss is not only damaging to wildlife, plants and the roughly 4 million people who live in the Arctic — it has global consequences. Sea ice acts like a giant mirror, reflecting the sunlight away from the Earth and back into space. As it shrinks, more of the sun’s energy is absorbed by the dark ocean, which accelerates global heating.
Part of the reason for the recent run of record-low sea ice is the unusual heat in the Arctic, which has been warming around four times faster than the global average.
Early February’s extreme warmth “was one of the strongest ever recorded,” said Rantanen, who estimates it was probably in the top three of the most intense warming events in the satellite era since the 1970s.
The Arctic landscape is changing too, said the NSIDC’s Twila Moon.
The thawing of permafrost — a jumble of soil, rocks and sediment held together by ice — is pervasive, she said, releasing planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane.
Wildfires have become more frequent and intense and wildfire seasons run longer. Last year marked the third time in five years significant, widespread blazes ripped across the Arctic.
These changes are fundamentally altering the ecosystem. For thousands of years, the shrubby landscape of the Arctic tundra stored carbon, but wildfires and thawing permafrost mean that this region is now releasing more carbon than it stores, according to NOAA.
“There’s just an overwhelming amount of change happening in the Arctic right now,” said Moon.
What happens in the Arctic has repercussions across the planet.
A warmer Arctic means land ice — glaciers and ice sheets — melts faster, adding to sea level rise. The Greenland ice sheet already sheds around 280 billion tons of ice a year, enough to cover the whole of Manhattan in a layer of ice roughly 2 miles thick.
Rapid warming in the region also weakens the jet stream, altering weather systems that affect billions of people, said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center. A more meandering jet stream “makes weather conditions linger longer, leading to more persistent heat waves, cold spells, drought, and stormy periods,” she told CNN.
Scientists say some of these changes can be reversed if humans stop pumping out planet-heating gases, but on timescales ranging from hundreds of years to many thousands. Many of these changes are considered “relatively irreversible,” Moon said.
There’s another threat, too. Scientists’ ability to keep tabs on the swift-changing Arctic is being jeopardized by geopolitical upheaval.
Russia’s war on Ukraine has meant scientists from the country, the largest Arctic nation, have been excluded from international collaboration. This has already undermined scientists’ ability to track what’s happening in the Arctic, according to a recent study.
In the US, the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts to government climate science jobs is creating serious concern, especially as many measurement systems are maintained by the US. With less US expertise and fewer US scientists, “it would become much, much harder to understand what’s happening” at a vital time for the Arctic, said the University of Hamburg’s Notz.
What’s happening in the Arctic is one of the starkest indications of “how powerful we humans have become in changing the face of our planet,” Notz said. “We are able to wipe out entire landscapes.”"
Officials and experts warn that Pentagon plans to cut climate programs will hurt national security,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/09/politics/pentagon-climate-cuts-national-security/index.html,"Officials and experts warn that Pentagon plans to cut climate programs will hurt national security

As the Pentagon and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency set their sights on climate-related programs at the Defense Department, officials and experts are warning that slashing them could put US troops and military operations at risk, both in the near and long term.
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior Pentagon officials have pointed to climate programs as a prime example of wasteful spending in the military. Hegseth told reporters in Germany in February that the Pentagon is “not in the business of climate change.”
Acting Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Salesses also made it clear that funding would be cut in a statement last month, saying the Pentagon will “cease unnecessary spending that set our military back under the previous administration, including through so-called ‘climate change’ and other woke programs.”
But some officials and experts argue such thinking is short-sighted.
“I think they’re stuck on the word ‘climate’ and not seeing the operational impacts,” one US official said, adding that the cuts will pose “readiness issues all around.”
In response to multiple questions from CNN about military readiness as it relates to climate programs and the cutting of funding to research and other efforts, Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said the Defense Department “is working closely with DOGE to identify efficiencies and savings across the department on behalf of taxpayers while we restore the warrior ethos and refocus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting and winning wars.”
“Climate zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part of that core mission,” Ullyot said.
Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, former assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations and environment, told CNN that climate programs are not just important to giving the US military an edge on adversaries like China, but they also help keep service members and their families safe.
“Inaction at this point will put our readiness and the lives of our troops and their families at greater risk,” he said.
Indeed, officials who spoke to CNN pointed to a number of programs within the Defense Department that could technically be tagged as climate-related but have real operational impacts on the military.
Making military installations more resilient to extreme weather events, for example, could save the Pentagon billions in the long term as wildfires and hurricanes become more common and more intense. In 2019, the Air Force requested $5 billion to rebuild two major bases after hurricanes and flooding caused severe damage.
Extreme weather also impacts the ability of service members to train – one Senate aide familiar with the discussions around climate programs in the Pentagon told CNN there has been an increase of “black flag” training days, meaning troops cannot train because it’s too hot outside.
Chaudhary pointed to an array of other issues caused by changes in climate: Wildfires delaying launch cadences at Space Force bases in the US; melting permafrost in Alaska impacting US runways in the Arctic; building natural and artificial reefs around US installations to protect bases from storm surges; and energy efficiency efforts by the Air Force to reduce drag on US aircraft and save millions on fuel.
Will Rogers, the former senior climate adviser to the secretary of the Army who is now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, also warned the rhetoric coming from senior officials disparaging climate-related efforts could have a “paralyzing effect on critical modernization efforts” related to climate, the impact of which could be felt “for years.”
Opportunities for China
Outside of protecting US military installations and personnel, sources also warned that ignoring climate issues could damage the US’ national security interests abroad.
Chaudhary and the Senate aide both pointed to China’s willingness to fill any gaps left by the US, particularly with Pacific island nations that often consider climate change one of the most pressing threats facing their existence. A former senior Pentagon official told CNN that climate change is a top priority for many Pacific islands – many of which the US will depend on for facilities such as airplane runways and ports in the scenario of conflict with China. And if the US is unwilling to help those countries with climate resiliency, China will be more than happy to step in, the former senior official warned.
Rogers said that concern exists not only in the Pacific, but also in the Horn of Africa and Central and South America.
“If we say, ‘Hey, we’re not interested in climate change,’ our adversaries or near peer competitors – whatever you want to call them – are more than happy to slide into [partners’ and allies’] DMs and offer funding at our detriment,” the Senate aide said.
And it’s not just efforts being directly carried out by the Defense Department at risk; Pentagon leadership has also narrowed in on funding for academic research related to climate change and security issues abroad.
In a video posted on X last week, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell named programs that Musk’s DOGE had identified as wasteful spending within the Degense Depatment.
“How about this one: $1.6 million to the University of Florida to study social and institutional detriments of vulnerability in resilience to climate hazards in African Sahel,” Parnell said in the video. “You see folks – this stuff is not a core function of our military. This is not what we do, this is a distraction from our core mission.”
The project in question – more accurately called Social and Institutional Determinants of Vulnerability and Resilience to Climate Hazards in the African Sahel – does study climate change. But it specifically focuses on how people in the African Sahel could respond, and the risks it could pose not only to their population but also to the security of nations around them.
“Our project was attempting to understand how people are responding and with what consequences, right? I mean, if people starve, that’s really bad, obviously … but if you’re the US government and thinking in totally narrow self-interested terms, it’s also bad if people join radical groups because they are desperate, or migrate en masse to other areas and put pressure on refugee camps and borders or governments,” said Leonardo Villalón, the lead investigator of the project and founder of the University of Florida’s Sahel Research Group.
‘No communication’
“There was absolutely no question, no communication, no nothing about it ahead of time,” Villalón said. “So had someone reached out and said could you please explain to us what you’re doing and why this is worth doing, I would have happily spoken to anybody.”
Villalón added that despite Parnell’s insinuation that the Pentagon was saving $1.6 million by cutting the program, the majority of their grant had already been spent over the last few years as he and his team conducted research, traveling to the countries they were studying – which included Senegal, Niger, Chad and Mauritania – conducting interviews and surveys.
“In our case,” he said, “they saved no more than $200,000.”
The funding was provided under the Minerva Research Initiative, a Defense Department program launched in 2008 that provides academic grants to further social science research on topics “of strategic importance to the US national security policy,” its website previously said. As of Friday, the Minerva Research Initiative’s website was offline.
Villalón told CNN last week that multiple other climate-related research initiatives had their funding cut off. A Defense Department news release Friday afternoon said the Pentagon was “scrapping its social science research portfolio,” including research focused on “global migration patterns, climate change impacts, and social trends.” The release said the Defense Department expects to save “more than $30 million in the first year through the discontinuation of 91 studies.”
Ultimately, that research is meant to help the Pentagon get ahead of major events that could have serious security side effects, Villalón said.
“We live in a very interconnected world, and the US, like everybody else, has an interest in preventing areas of significant instability and suffering that have repercussions for the rest of the world. … What we’re trying to do is understand the situations in these places on the premise that a not knowing about it is going to come back and bite us, frankly,” he said.
“We have learned that elsewhere in the world – whether it’s in Central America, Afghanistan, or other places – we don’t gain by not understanding other parts of the world,” he added. “Ignorance is not a solution.”"

A striking new visualization made by climate scientist Zeke Hausfather unfurls like a flower blooming in the spring, its colors moving from blue to red. It may look beautiful but what it reveals is an alarming picture of a heating planet.
The graphic shows the increase in daily global temperatures between 1940 and the end of 2024 compared to the period before humans began burning huge amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels.
It paints a stark picture. As the data spirals outwards, it becomes redder and redder as global temperatures ramp up.
Good visualizations can make climate change “more visceral and understandable,” said Hausfather, the climate research lead at Stripe and a research scientist at Berkeley Earth.
Charting the evolution of global temperatures over the past 85 years makes it “crystal clear how rapidly the planet has warmed over the past few decades, and how worryingly hot both 2023 and 2024 were compared to any prior years,” he told CNN.
Last year was the hottest year in recorded history, breaking a record set just the year before. It was also the first calendar year to breach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a critical climate threshold.
Scientists have been struggling to fully explain the extraordinary heat of the past few years. While it has been driven predominantly by burning fossil fuels and the natural climate pattern El Niño, these factors alone don’t entirely explain the unusually rapid temperature rise.
What scientists are clear on, however, is that every fraction of a degree the world warms, the worse the effects will be for humans and ecosystems, including more frequent and severe fires, storms and floods.
“Global warming has accelerated in recent years and poses a major threat to our livelihood and to the natural world if we do not take action to reduce emissions,” Hausfather said."
The polar vortex is acting weird and the US is paying the price this winter,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/weather/polar-vortex-cold-winter-climate/index.html,"The polar vortex is acting weird and the US is paying the price this winter
Follow:
It’s really, really cold again — as the US shivers through at least the eighth blast of air from the Arctic this winter.
Winter, which is warming faster than any other season for much of the US, seems to be making a comeback for the first time in years; this January was the coldest in the Lower 48 since 1988.
But the US is an outlier, and so is this winter. January was the warmest on record for the globe and, in a vast expanse of global warmth, the US sticks out like a cold, sore thumb.
Scientists say it’s being caused by a misbehaving polar vortex combining with a key weather pattern that seems to be stuck in place.
Some scientists say these factors and this winter could be examples of how extreme cold behaves in a warming world. Others argue it doesn’t paint a complete picture and further research is needed.
What they do have consensus on is that winter is getting warmer as the planet warms because of fossil fuel pollution, so this Arctic blast from the past feels more like a relic of a bygone era.
“We’re definitely shifting the goal posts on what winter looks like,” Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist with the University of California, Berkeley, said, noting that when we experience a season that’s actually chilly, it’s somewhat jarring.
“There’s no location in the US where the coldest day of the year has gotten colder over the last 50 years,” Hausfather continued. “Our memories are short as to what a normal winter is.”
How Alaska’s cold keeps ending up in the Lower 48
A few atmospheric factors — including the polar vortex — have come together to make the US the epicenter of cold this winter.
One is a weather pattern around the Arctic Circle that has emerged more frequently than usual this winter and is driving this week’s cold, according to Judah Cohen, director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research.
It features a large, long-lasting area of high pressure known as a blocking high because it blocks cold air and reroutes it south via a large dip the jet stream — the river of air over the US that storms flow through –— that also separates cold air from warm air.
This high has been stuck over Alaska and northwest Canada, which is something that generally happens more often during La Niña winters and forces the cold to spill into parts of the Lower 48. The end result has been one of the warmest winters to-date in Alaska and an unusually cold one in the Lower 48.
The frequent emergence of this pattern this winter could be a sign of things to come in a warming world. A 2023 study found blocking highs in the Arctic Circle similar to this year’s would become more frequent as the Arctic warmed and weakened the jet stream, allowing more cold to spill south.
It’s part of a growing body of research linking the rapidly warming Arctic to changes in jet stream behavior and extreme cold. Other scientists, including Hausfather, think additional research is needed.
Whether or not it’s connected to climate change, the pattern is still rearing its head this winter and it’s working in tandem with the polar vortex.
Vortex stretching: Not a fitness routine
The jet stream and frigid air just could not make it quite as far south without also having help from the polar vortex, according to Cohen. That’s because the polar vortex doesn’t cause US cold air outbreaks but instead amplifies them, Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center said.
The polar vortex is area of fast-moving winds well above the Earth’s surface and the jet stream that circle the Arctic during the Northern Hemisphere’s coldest months. When it’s strong, it keeps brutally cold air trapped in the Arctic, like a figure skater doing a spin with their arms tight to their body. When it’s weak, the cold air frequently spills south.
The polar vortex has been “considerably stronger” than usual this year, according to Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, which should keep record-breaking cold out of the US. But it hasn’t because the polar vortex has been frequently been stretching into weird shapes Cohen said.
A strong polar vortex is circular like a rubber band when it rests on a surface untouched. But energy circling the atmosphere can sometimes smash into the polar vortex, like two hands trying to fling a rubber band, stretching it into something more oblong than circular. That’s what’s happening now.
Now stretched, the polar vortex can then shift the jet stream even farther south than just the blocking high could do on its own. This allows more cold air to spill into the US, and further south, too, Cohen explained.
See, for example, the below-zero wind chills Dallas endured Wednesday morning, or when New Orleans was buried under a record-breaking 8 inches of snow in January.
The polar vortex has been snapping back and forth from a normal to a stretched state with unusual frequency this year, hence all of the cold snaps, Cohen said. At least 10 of these stretched polar vortex events have occurred this winter, including the ongoing event, according to Cohen: four in December, four in January and two in February.
The polar vortex is usually “like an aircraft carrier, it doesn’t turn around quickly and isn’t very nimble,” Cohen said. “I’ve really never seen anything like it.”
These polar vortex stretches are happening more frequently as the world — and especially the Arctic — warms, a 2021 paper published in the journal Science, also co-authored by Cohen, demonstrated.
And it’s having a huge impact. A stretched polar vortex event played a significant role in the Arctic outbreak that froze Texas in February 2021, killing more than 200 people, according to Cohen’s study.
The blocking pattern and stretched polar vortex are two factors at the forefront of a still-active and often highly debated area of research into both why and how frequently extreme cold outbreaks reach the US in a warming world.
“There are multiple ways that human caused climate change is having an influence on the jet stream, but it’s never clear which factor is the most important one in any given event, like the cold spell happening now,” Francis explained. “It’s always a combination (of factors), and it’s always complicated.”
There could be other yet to be discovered influences, and confidence will grow as research continues, but scientists know extreme bouts of cold like what’s happening this winter will still happen even as temperatures keep rising globally.
“These extreme cold events (will) perhaps happen more often, even though they probably won’t be quite as cold over time as the air generally warms,” Francis concluded. But when they do, “they’re going to be just as disruptive.”

Dangerously cold conditions will impact over 60 million Americans between Wednesday and the weekend spanning a large swath of the US and setting the stage for widespread disruptions from a winter storm.
Arctic air is interacting with a strengthening storm system to bring hazardous winter weather to the central US, which will eventually reach the mid-Atlantic coast. The bitter cold and snow will also complicate recovery efforts in parts of Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia, where communities are still reeling from deadly floods caused by a storm over the weekend.
At least 15 people have died from last weekend’s storm, including two in West Virginia and 12 in Kentucky. One person remained missing in the storm’s aftermath in West Virginia Tuesday morning, according to Gov. Patrick Morrisey. Two others appeared to have died from hypothermia in Kentucky’s Jefferson County, Gov. Andy Beshear said at a Tuesday morning news conference.
“That should tell all of us the weather conditions are as dangerous as that water is,” Beshear said, referring to the ongoing brutal cold and snow coming to the state.
The cold air will get more intense and expansive throughout the week and about three-quarters of the US population is expected to experience below-freezing conditions by Friday.
Temperatures will plunge as much as 50 degrees below February averages, with more than 270 temperature records across at least 27 states.
Snow headed for flooded areas in Kentucky and West Virginia
February has been an intensively active month for disruptive and deadly winter storms in the US, and the pattern isn’t over yet.
A new winter storm will dump 3 to 6 inches of snow over much of flooded Kentucky and more than 6 inches in parts of West Virginia, complicating the post-storm cleanup process.
Crews in Kentucky and West Virginia were racing against the clock to complete flood rescues ahead of the dangerous wintry weather. Since the flooding began, emergency crews from the Kentucky National Guard and Kentucky State Police have conducted more than 1,000 rescues, Beshear said.
At least 60 rescues had taken place across southern West Virginia which was hardest-hit by the flooding, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Tuesday.
There was hope water rescues would ebb Wednesday in Kentucky and allow crews to reset and prepare for winter weather, Eric Gibson, director of the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management, said Tuesday.
“The Kentucky National Guard is transitioning from life-saving missions to recovery efforts focused on debris removal, restoring access and transporting supplies to affected communities,” Gov. Beshear said in press conference Tuesday.
Power restoration efforts are continuing in the state and just over 4,000 customers remain without power, according to Poweroutage.us. Still, some people with power but damaged equipment might not have safe access to heat, Beshear said Tuesday.
“If you cannot safely power your home by the middle of today, you need to be looking at a shelter option,” Beshear urged. “You need to make sure you’re safe.”
Wind chills are expected to reach the single digits in most of Kentucky Wednesday morning and air temperatures will be stuck below freezing through Friday in most areas.
Life-threatening cold expands to the Plains and the Gulf
The coldest air of winter started to work its way into the northern US early this week and will expand rapidly across the Southern Plains and along the Gulf Coast in the coming days.
Wind chill temperatures reached a life-threatening nearly 60 degrees below zero in parts of Montana and North Dakota Tuesday morning. Tuesday was the coldest it’s been in Bismarck, North Dakota, in more than 16 years. Below zero wind chills extended as far south as Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
In South Dakota, Sioux Falls reached a high temperature of -1 degrees on Tuesday, breaking the daily record for the cold high for February 18th. The previous record was 3 degrees, set in 1901.
In Hastings, Nebraska, a high temperature of -2 degrees was recorded on Tuesday, which shattered the previous cold high of February 18 of 5 degrees in 1993. The average for the city is 41 degrees.
Oklahoma City dropped below freezing early Tuesday and will continue to stay below freezing until Saturday morning. The city will likely break numerous cold records by the end of the week.
In Kansas City, which typically records a high of 45 degrees in February, temperatures dropped to single digits Monday evening and will not reach 10 degrees again until Thursday afternoon. Temperatures will not top the freezing mark until Saturday afternoon.
Dallas has an expected high temperature below freezing on Wednesday, running over 30 degrees below their average of 61 degrees this time of year.
The cold will spread to the Southeast as the end of the week approaches.
Snow and ice caused significant travel issues by Tuesday afternoon in parts of Oklahoma. Interstate 44 was shut down in both directions in the northeast part of the state and into far western Missouri.
States of emergency were in effect for Arkansas, North Carolina and Virginia due to the storm.
Parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas could receive more than a foot of snow Tuesday into Wednesday, including Springfield, Missouri, which would be its most snow in nearly 20 years. Major impacts from the storm are expected in this region, including dangerous to impossible driving conditions, according to NOAA’s Winter Storm Severity Index.
Memphis could record 1 to 3 inches of snow and sleet, and also some ice, while Nashville could get up to 3 inches of mainly snow. Flood alerts are still in place for area rivers, including the Mississippi and Cumberland.
Snow will also fall in Virginia, where flood alerts remain active for the James River. It will be heaviest closest to the Atlantic coast. Virginia Beach is forecast to receive 10 inches of snow, which would be its most since 1980.
Dangerous cold will expand over the country while the winter storm tracks east through midweek.
Wind chills will make the cold even more dangerous. In the Northern Plains, wind chills are expected to range from 30 to 60 degrees below zero, creating risks of frostbite within minutes of exposure.
Gusty winds will push wind chills below zero as far south as Texas and Arkansas by midweek, while single-digit wind chills are expected in parts of Tennessee and Kentucky toward the end of the week.

Editor’s Note: This story is no longer being updated. Read our latest story for news on all of the winter storms.
As California prepares for heavy rain in areas recently burned by wildfires, the first of three storms expected in the US this week impacted communities from the Ohio Valley east to New Jersey.
Rain, snow and sleet fell across a 1,500-mile stretch of the eastern US Tuesday, with more than a foot of snow recorded across parts of the Appalachians in Virginia and West Virginia.
The second of back-to-back-to-back winter storms will hit some of the same areas in quick succession Wednesday and dump the most substantial snow of the season over Chicago. The third storm is the most serious flood threat Southern California has faced since January’s devastating wildfires.
Each is another link in a chain of disruptive storms unbroken since the start of February.
Here’s the latest:
• Snowing in DC: Snow began in the mid-afternoon in the nation’s capital and continued overnight. Up to 6 inches of snow will pile up which could snarl travel during the afternoon and evening commute. As much snow as the past two winters combined has already fallen in Washington, DC, this winter.
• Snow is piling up: Snow fell from Kentucky to the Mid-Atlantic Tuesday afternoon. Widespread snow totals of 3 to 6 inches have already coated areas from central Kentucky to western Virginia. Around 1 to 3 inches has fallen farther east in Virginia. There’s more to come into Wednesday morning as the storm tracks east.
• Power outages and treacherous travel likely: Significant amounts of ice – more than 0.25 inches – are possible through Wednesday in parts of West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina. “Ice accumulations could make many roads treacherous and impassable,” the National Weather Service warned Tuesday. “The weight of ice on tree limbs and power lines could produce numerous outages.”
Storm one hits Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic
Tuesday’s storm is tracking farther south than either of last week’s and putting areas that avoided a wintry mess right in the thick of it.
Parts of Virginia recorded over a foot of snow, with Iron Gate recording 14.5 inches and Hollins seeing 13.8 inches. West Virginia’s Fairlea saw 13 inches, while Easton, Maryland, and Dover, Delaware, measured 8 and 7.5 inches, respectively.
Heavy snow piled quickly in some areas, including Washington, DC. As many as 1,100 additional workers traveling from North Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky and Ohio were requested by Appalachian Power to help as snow, ice and rain are expected to hit the area, the utility company said Tuesday.
“Ice accumulations over a quarter inch weigh down trees and electric lines, which can cause substantial utility problems,” the company said.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency, and the Virginia Department of Transportation urged residents to “stay off the roads.” There’s been at least 305 crashes reported statewide, with at least 24 of those crashes reporting injuries, according to state police.
The Virginia National Guard staged dozens of soldiers to aid with storm response. Portions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a key roadway that runs alongside the Potomac River, is closed because of the weather, the National Park Service said.
Reagan National Airport in Washington, DC, has logged 5.9 inches of snow, contributing to its snowiest season in years, with 14.3 inches so far — more than the last two winters combined. The storm disrupted travel, causing 230 flight cancellations there on Tuesday and 96 more by early Wednesday.
Snow also blanketed parts of Pennsylvania into New Jersey and will affect southern New England Wednesday. New York City will likely see an inch or two of snow.
Montgomery County Public Schools, Maryland’s largest school district, will be closed Wednesday the district announced, citing “forecasts predicting up to six inches of accumulation.” Several school districts in Virginia are also closed Wednesday.
Heavy rain is drenching an area to the south on the warmer side of the storm. There’s a risk of flooding over a wide area of the South through Wednesday. A level 2 of 4 risk is in place for parts of every state from Texas to the Carolinas — including many areas still recovering from Hurricane Helene — during this time, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
Storm two: From the Plains eastward
The next storm will form in the central US while its predecessor is still bringing snow and ice to the East and rain to the South. Snow, ice and rain are expected in the Plains into Wednesday morning.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly issued a state of disaster emergency proclamation on Sunday due to the storm.
The wintry mess will quickly expand Wednesday to encompass much of the Midwest and parts of the Northeast by the evening.
The bulk of the storm will be on the East Coast by Thursday morning with snow and ice blanketing the Northeast and rain falling farther south. Some parts of the East will only have a few hours between when the first storm ends and the second begins.
Widespread rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected from east Texas to the western Carolinas through early Thursday. Isolated totals up to 6 inches are possible. Flood watches are in effect for portions of 9 states from Texas to West Virginia and a level 2 of 4, slight risk of excessive rainfall covers much of the region as well.
There is also a level 2 of 5, slight chance of severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes, on Wednesday across the Deep South from Louisiana to Georgia.
Snow totals from this storm will be highest in the Plains and Midwest. They could approach double digits in Kansas City, Missouri, on Wednesday — close to double what the city typically gets in all of February.
Double-digit snow is also possible in Chicago Wednesday, which would be enough to be the city’s most substantial so far this season. Just over 7 inches of snow have fallen since December when the city typically records almost two feet by now.
Ice will present a significant problem again just south of where the heaviest snow falls. At least a light glaze of ice — enough to make travel tricky — is possible anywhere from Oklahoma and Kansas through the Ohio Valley and Northeast.
Parts of the Appalachians will get another round of ice from this storm. A few of the locations hit hardest from the first storm might not notice a break between the two storms as icy precipitation slows but doesn’t completely stop Wednesday afternoon.
This storm will reinvigorate rain and thunderstorms in the South Wednesday. Some thunderstorms could turn severe in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama starting in the afternoon and a Level 2 of 5 threat is in place.
The storm will largely come to an end by Thursday night.
Storm three: California
This storm will be different than the previous two in that it will first slam into California fully formed.
The atmospheric river-fueled storm will pack a significant punch and from the start with rain beginning along much of the state’s coast early Thursday morning. Rain will get heavier throughout the day as it reaches farther inland and spreads over the entire length of the state.
The upcoming storm will be the “most significant” so far this winter in Southern California, Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, warned Tuesday.
Portions of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura counties – including areas burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall Thursday, according to the WPC. More than 35 million in the rest of the state are under a level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall Thursday. The threat area encompasses San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego and areas in between.
Heavy rain presents an even greater risk to areas burned by recent deadly wildfires. An evacuation warning has been issued for those in “areas within and near the Lake Fire burn scar” in Santa Barbara County, the Sheriff’s office said Tuesday.
“Given the elevated chances for significant debris flows consisting of raging torrents of rockslides and mudslides that can be damaging and even deadly, now is the time to start getting prepared for these potentially dangerous conditions,” Cohen urged.
The Palisades Fire burn scar is projected to receive more than 3 inches of rain, while the Eaton Fire burn zone could see around 4.5 inches, according to the weather service’s Tuesday update.
The threat to the burn scar areas comes as officials are tackling the effort to remove hazardous debris left behind by the fires. Los Angeles County recently bolstered storm preparations by cleaning debris basins, installing concrete barriers, and placing sandbags in fire zones to filter debris and protect storm drains.
More than 7,500 feet of concrete barriers and more than 6,500 sandbags have been deployed to areas burned in the Palisades Fire in case of debris flows, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced Tuesday.
Thursday’s flood risk will not be confined to areas scorched by wildfires. This storm will dump 1 to 3 inches of rain over the Los Angeles basin and totals could approach 6 inches in the area’s mountains – including burn scars.
“Of course we’re concerned about the Palisades and the burned areas, but this is for all of Los Angeles to be concerned about the rain and the impacts,” Bass implored.
This storm will also bring heavy snow to California’s Sierra Nevada and mountainous areas of the West. It will track east Thursday night and Friday and reach the Plains by early Saturday morning.
A boost of atmospheric energy will reinvigorate the potent storm and significantly expand its size once it reaches the central US. Snow will blast over the Midwest Saturday and reach much of the Northeast by the evening. Some sleet and ice may mix with snow in the Northeast with mainly rain drenching areas farther south Saturday night.
Heavy rain and thunderstorms will dominate the warm side of this storm. Some thunderstorms could become severe, especially in parts of the South. Dangerous thunderstorms can happen at any time of the year – some turned deadly last week in Tennessee.
The large storm will continue to pound the East Coast Sunday before coming to an end by Monday morning. But it may not be the end of a busy winter storm pattern as another storm is possible by the middle of next week.

Swaths of the US may be grappling with frigid weather, but for the planet as a whole, heat records are being obliterated — and it spells very bad news. Two new studies conclude it’s a signal the planet is likely on track to breach the Paris climate agreement goal of restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The studies, both published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, are the latest evidence the world is failing to tackle the climate crisis, and they come just weeks after an even starker warning from renowned climate scientist James Hansen, who said the planet was on course to shoot past 2 degrees of global warming over the next two decades.
While many scientists have said these levels of warming can be avoided with immediate, rapid emission cuts, the chances of this seem increasingly slim as international climate action falters. One of President Donald Trump’s first actions was to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement and now others, including Argentina and Indonesia, are reportedly mulling withdrawal.
The Paris agreement is hugely symbolic. In 2015, almost every country in the world agreed to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees above the period before humans began burning large amounts of fossil fuels, with the ambition of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.
Above 1.5 degrees, scientists say increasingly extreme heat, drought, floods and fires will become hard for humans and ecosystems to adapt to. At 2 degrees, millions of more lives would be at risk and the danger rises significantly of triggering tipping points such as ice sheet melting and the death of the world’s coral reefs.
Since 2015, 1.5 has become synonymous with staving off more catastrophic climate change. Yet global temperatures have kept rising. Last year was the first calendar year to breach 1.5 degrees.
As Paris goals refer to averages over around two decades, rather than single months or years, this means breaching the agreement can only be confidently confirmed in hindsight, once it’s too late.
So scientists behind these two new papers attempted to determine whether the world is already in its first long-term period of 1.5 degree warming. The news is not good.
The study by Alex Cannon, a research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, found there was a 60% to 80% chance the Paris threshold has already been crossed given 12 consecutive months have already been at least 1.5 degrees.
If the world experiences 18 consecutive months at or above the 1.5 degree limit, it will be “virtually certain” the Paris agreement has been breached, the report found.
The other paper, led by Emanuele Bevacqua, a climate scientist at the Helmholtz Centre in Germany, used real-world climate data and climate modeling. Looking at historical warming trends, it found the first single year to breach a temperature threshold also fell within the first 20-year period in which average temperatures reached the same threshold.
If these trends continue, it is almost certain 2024 will fall within the first 20-year period of 1.5-degree warming, the report concluded.
Both papers stress that rapid and strong climate action can still reduce the likelihood of breaching the Paris agreement goals over the next years and decades.
“To all intents and purposes, breaching the 1.5 degree threshold is a given,” said Richard Allen, a climate science professor at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the studies. “We need to double down efforts to avoid the even more dangerous 2-degree Celsius threshold by rapidly and massively cutting greenhouse gas emissions.”
For others, however, that ship has already sailed. The climate scientist James Hansen, who was among the first to publicly warn the world about climate change, said last year the 1.5 goal was “deader than a doornail.”
This month he co-authored a paper which concluded global warming is accelerating faster than expected, due in large part to regulations to reduce shipping pollution. While this pollution is a human health hazard, it also has the effect of reflecting sunlight away from the Earth.
As a result, he said, global heating is likely to exceed 2 degrees in the next few decades with devastating consequences, including ice sheet melt and sea level rise.
The new papers are undoubtedly bad news, said Daniela Schmidt, professor of Earth sciences at the University of Bristol, but she warned against fixating on 1.5 degrees. It “has the real risk of reducing actions, demotivating all of us,” if it’s surpassed, she said.
A lack of ambition will keep the world on its current warming trajectory of around 3 degrees, she added. “Such warming has immense, and in parts irreversible, consequences for nature and people.”"
New series of winter storms lining up to bring more snow and ice to the nation’s midsection,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/weather/winter-storms-weekend-weather/index.html,"New series of winter storms lining up to bring more snow and ice to the nation’s midsection
Follow:
As the Midwest and Northeast dig out from back-to-back winter storms, new systems are building and are expected to dump more snow from the middle of the country to the East Coast this week.
Plenty of cold air remains in place to the north, helping to set the stage for a wide band of wintry mix and snow, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
The first storm will form in the Central US Monday night and ramp up as it heads east, bringing snow and freezing rain to parts of the Appalachian Mountains, mid-Atlantic and southern portions of the Northeast Tuesday through Wednesday.
The worst conditions are expected across the Appalachian Mountains from Northwestern North Carolina into Southwestern Virginia, with ice over 0.25 inches expected, which could cause downed tree limbs, power outages and travel headaches.
Snow is more likely through the I-95 corridor from Richmond to Philadelphia, including Washington, DC, which is already under a winter storm watch Tuesday into Wednesday and could see 4-6 inches.
The district has already seen more snowfall this year than the last two years combined, with more on the way.
Then, on the heels of the first storm of the week, another will move in quickly behind it.
The storm will start in the Central Plains Tuesday evening through Wednesday, where heavy snow is possible for cities like Kansas City, while Oklahoma City and Springfield, Missouri, could see freezing rain.
A winter storm watch for Wednesday and Thursday has already been posted across much of northern Kansas and Missouri. Snowfall across the I-70 corridor could exceed 5 inches, and Kansas City could potentially see 4-8 inches of snowfall.
This storm’s effects will spread to the Great Lakes for Wednesday and could bring snowfall to cities like Chicago and St. Louis. The current forecast for the second storm calls for rainfall to be the most likely form of precipitation for the major metropolitan cities across the Northeast.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly issued a verbal state of disaster emergency proclamation on Sunday due to incoming winter weather expected to hit the state as early as Monday evening.
“As I did during past storms, I urge all Kansans to take measures to make sure their families are ready by making a home emergency kit and emergency plan,” Kelly said.
Major cities expecting more storms
Below-normal temperatures are likely to be recorded across much of the continental US over the next few weeks, the weather service said. This combination of active weather and prolonged cold may cause a continued stretch of winter disruption for many Americans.
Here are the projected weather impacts for major cities as the storms move across the country. The first storm will affect the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast while the second will affect the Central US:
A third storm is set to hit the West Coast late Wednesday, bringing a threat of heavy rain to Southern California on Thursday. In Ventura Country, the rain could trigger life-threatening debris flows in burn scar areas from January’s wildfire.
The Weather Prediction Center has issued a level 2 out of 4 risk for excessive rainfall, threatening more than 34 million people across Central and Southern California Thursday, including Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles.
By the weekend, the storm is expected to move east, bringing additional weather risks to the Central and Eastern US.
Earlier double-barreled storm brought heavy snow
Parts of the Northeast woke up to more than a foot of snow Sunday morning, as a fast-moving winter storm, packing snow, sleet and ice, sped across the Midwest into the Northeast over the weekend.
More than 15 million people from the Midwest to the Northeast were under winter alerts while the storm moved through. Those warnings have now expired. While the snow has mostly come to an end, travelers are experiencing delays due to the weather, and officials are warning people to watch out for snow-covered, slippery roads.
As fans made their way into New Orleans for Super Bowl Sunday, dense fog in the area caused reduced visibility in several locations, the National Weather Service warned, urging drivers to exercise extreme caution on roadways.
More than 400 flights into or out of the US were canceled Sunday, with another 3,800 flights delayed, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.
Parts of New York state, Wisconsin and Vermont received more than a foot of snow since it began falling Saturday, while states from Minnesota to Maine saw between 2.5 to 11 inches.
Snow-covered and slippery roads could cause dangerous travel conditions, and areas with heavy ice could experience power outages and minor tree damage, the weather service said.
In New York and Boston, crews worked Sunday to clear snow and ice from the roads. Boston had 41,000 tons of salt are on hand to treat streets blanketed by heavy snow, the city previously announced.
The storm system moved in two rounds: The first brought heavy snow to the Midwest on Saturday afternoon, followed by significant snowfall in parts of the Northeast, coupled with icy conditions in the Appalachians.
Along with the snowfall in the Midwest and Northeast, the storm brought icy conditions to the Appalachians.
Colder temperatures are coming
Three more systems are on the horizon through this weekend, with another Arctic blast expected to push temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below seasonal norms across the Northeast. Meteorologists attribute this active pattern to the positioning of the jet stream, which is funneling storms across the northern US.
The jet stream, essentially a river of air in the atmosphere that storms flow through, is locked in an almost perfect line from west to east and will continue to funnel fast-moving storms across the northern tier of the Lower 48.
This pattern has been responsible for maintaining lower-than-average temperatures across much of the country this winter. New storms are expected to arrive every few days until the jet stream shifts – something that might not happen until the second half of February.
This weekend’s storms are just part of what forecasters expect will be an active February for winter weather.

Editor’s Note: Find the latest coverage of the winter storm here.
The second of five storms that will slam the eastern half of the United States with snow and ice over a two week period is on the way — and this one has more snow than the first.
The first storm unleashed deadly severe weather, life-threatening flooding and dangerous ice and snow as it raced over the Midwest and Northeast Wednesday and Thursday.
The next storm already slammed into the West Coast late Thursday and is racing east through the northern Rockies Friday. It will move so quickly that it will take less than 72 hours for it to go coast-to-coast, delivering heavy snow to the Midwest Saturday and the Northeast Saturday night and Sunday.
More than 80 million people across the US are expected to be impacted by “a swath of disruptive & hazardous wintry weather” over the Super Bowl weekend, the National Weather Service said.
The storms are being driven by the jet stream, essentially a river of air in the atmosphere that storms flow through. It’s locked in an almost perfect line from west to east, and will continue to funnel fast-moving storms across the northern tier of the Lower 48.
New storms will arrive every few days until the jet stream shifts — something that might not happen until mid-February. So more snow could pile up over the next two weeks in some parts of the East, including Boston and New York City, than happened in the past two winters combined.
Snow from the next storm will begin early Saturday over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Precipitation will expand as the storm is boosted by atmospheric energy to its south. A mix of rain and freezing rain will stretch from Missouri to the central Appalachians by Saturday morning while snow falls over the Great Lakes.
The storm will drop a widespread area of 3 to 6 inches of snow from central Minnesota through central Michigan. Lower snow totals are anticipated south of this streak of heavier snow: Chicago could end up with less than an inch of slush while Detroit sees an inch.
It could be dry between the two areas of wintry precipitation Saturday morning in an area from Chicago to Cleveland. An icy mix will fill in these dry areas by the afternoon.
A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will spread over Pennsylvania by Saturday evening. The same messy mix will spread through New Jersey, New York City and Long Island shortly after. Snow totals will climb higher than Thursday’s storm for much of New England and Upstate New York.
At least 6 inches of snow is possible from central portions of New York to southern Maine and over much of southern New England. Snow totals could approach the double-digit mark from Syracuse, New York, to Boston.
Boston could be buried by a foot of snow Saturday night and Sunday, which would be more snow than fell all of last winter. The city hasn’t had double-digit snowfall in a single day in just over three years.
The storm will come to an end by mid-morning Sunday for much of the Northeast. Some snow could linger into the early afternoon in Maine and coastal New England.
Many more storms to come
There will only be a brief lull in winter weather in the East to start next week before yet another storm.
The exact timing and extent of next week’s winter weather is still coming into focus, but the wide-reaching storm could develop in the Plains as soon as Monday evening. It will strengthen and precipitation will envelop much of the eastern half of the US overnight Monday and Tuesday.
It’s still unclear exactly how far north snow, sleet and freezing rain could spread, but anywhere from the Mississippi and Tennessee valleys north into the Midwest and Northeast could be in the storm’s path.
Another very similar storm could develop in the Plains just after midweek. Next week’s first storm will influence how this one develops and moves, so we won’t know more specific forecast details until next week.
That’s not all. Another cross-country storm could develop next weekend and bring more snow and ice to the eastern half of the US.
Snow totals will climb quickly as storm after storm hits the Northeast — something that hasn’t happened in the region in recent years.
Boston should record about 3 feet of snow each winter but less than 2 feet fell in the past two winters combined. This upcoming stretch could bring 1 to 2 feet of snow to the city, depending on each storm’s ultimate track.
A similar scenario could unfold in New York City. Less than 10 inches of snow blanketed the city in the past two winters but that amount could pile up during this busy stretch.

It’s time for blockbuster winter storms in the Northeast. Here’s what it will take to bring one to life,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/weather/february-winter-storm-forecast-northeast-climate/index.html,"It’s time for blockbuster winter storms in the Northeast. Here’s what it will take to bring one to life

Winter is finally living up to its name in the Northeast — at least partially. It’s been bitterly cold this winter, but many cities are still lagging behind on their typical snow.
February could change that. The ingredients needed to create blockbuster winter storms historically tend to align this month. Most of them are already in place now, and just need a storm to take the elusive right track to unlock winter’s full potential.
Trace a path along Interstate 95 from Virginia to Maine and nearly every city along and east of the busy roadway typically gets more snow in February than any other month.
More impactful Northeast snowstorms, many of which are powerful nor’easters, occur in February than any other month, according to a scale used to rank snowstorms from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.
That’s because peak snowiness in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast is tied to the Atlantic Ocean. Sea surface temperatures along the immediate Atlantic Coast start the winter relatively warm — large bodies of water are slow to shed heat from the summer and fall. Any storms that interact with this warmth are more likely to deliver rain than snow.
Sea surface temperatures near the coast usually cool off by February and allow coastal storms like nor’easters to tap into colder air and produce more snow instead of rain.
Sea surface temperatures near the coast are currently at or below normal from northern New England all the way to parts of the Carolinas after multiple bouts of brutally cold air swept over the eastern half of the US, according to NOAA data.
Ocean conditions are ripe near the Atlantic coast, but a few other factors need to align for a major snowstorm in the Northeast.
Cold air is a huge factor, and this season has put recent winters to shame: It’s on track to be one of the 10-coldest winters for dozens of Eastern Seaboard locales, according to data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center.
More cold is on the way that could help set the stage for a big snowstorm.
Warmer than normal air will stick around through the weekend for much of the mid-Atlantic, but colder air will arrive next week for the Northeast and start to cool off the rest of the Eastern Seaboard, too. Some weather forecast models are hinting at the potential return of widespread, bone-chilling cold later in the month.
Cold air and cool sea surface temperatures could be in place all season, but it’s not going to snow until a storm arrives that can tap into them. Most storms packing a big winter punch have tracked farther south than normal, missing the region.
La Niña could also play a role in Northeast snow. La Niña conditions arrived mid-winter. La Niña and its counterpart El Niño typically have a predictable and outsized effect on winter weather in the US, but this La Niña is quite weak, which muddles its influence.
A typical La Niña winter pattern would dictate warmer than normal conditions for much of the mid-Atlantic and southernmost parts of the Northeast — bad news for snow. Weak La Niñas also tend to give New England more snow than normal. Neither outcome has come to pass so far: Washington, DC, was buried in snow in January while New England has longed for it.
Missing snow
The last couple of winters in the Northeast were decidedly un-winterlike. Last winter was the warmest on record in both the Northeast and the entire Lower 48. The winter before is tied for the third-warmest in the Northeast.
Winter is the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US as the planet warms because of fossil fuel pollution.  Unseasonable warmth and lackluster snow totals go hand-in-hand, and snowfall is declining around the globe.
New York City has a snowfall deficit of more than 3 feet over the past two winters. Snow is still lagging this season despite the cold; the city should typically record at least a foot of snow from December through the end of January but just under 6 inches has fallen.
Other cities in the I-95 corridor – with the exception of Washington, DC, and Baltimore – are also running behind this season. Both Philadelphia and Boston recorded only half of the snow that typically falls from December through January.
Even New Orleans has had more snow than New York City – and almost as much snow as New York City and Philadelphia combined – after a historic storm dumped 8 inches on the city in January.
There are a couple of chances for snow this week that don’t appear to be a major storms, but could be the start of a trend this month if the ingredients all finally align."
"Climate change is disrupting food systems across Latin America, UN report says",https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/americas/climate-change-latin-america-un-report-int-latam/index.html,"Climate change is disrupting food systems across Latin America, UN report says
Follow:
Violent weather exacerbated by climate change fueled hunger and food insecurity across Latin America and the Caribbean in 2023, according to a new United Nations report.
Extreme weather drove up crop prices in multiple countries in the region in 2023, the report, which was written by several UN agencies including the World Food Program (WFP), says.
Hot weather and drought, intensified by the El Niño weather phenomenon, raised the price of corn in Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, while heavy rain in Ecuador caused a 32 to 54 percent increase in wholesale prices in the same year.
Though the report credits social safety nets with a measurable decrease in undernourishment throughout Latin America, it notes that the region’s poorest and most vulnerable populations are still more likely to suffer from food insecurity due to climate change – especially rural people.
“The shocks are getting much more extreme,” said Lola Castro, the WFP’s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. “This is what’s creating larger food insecurity and under-nutrition.”
Quoting a 2020 study, the report states that 36% of 439 small farms surveyed in rural Honduras and Guatemala experienced “episodic food insecurity due to extreme weather events.”

“In more rural areas they…don’t have a lot of resources to be able to weather a poor harvest,” said Ivy Blackmore, a researcher affiliated with the University of Missouri who studied nutrition and agriculture among Indigenous farming communities in Ecuador.
“You don’t generate as much income. There’s not as much nutritious food around, so they sell what they can, and then they purchase the cheapest thing that’ll fill them up,” she added.
In the communities she studied, erosion from prolonged rain led farmers to plant on virgin grassland nearby.
“They might have a couple of good harvests. Then the erosion continues, and they dig up more,” Blackmore said. “There’s extreme erosion going on because they’re just having to sustain themselves in the short term without being able to address these long-term consequences.”
A push for drought resistant crops
As extreme weather increases food prices, some consumers gravitate toward cheaper, but less nutritious, ultra-processed foods. This is a particularly dangerous trend in Latin America, the UN report says, where “the cost of healthy diets is the highest in the world” and both childhood and adult obesity have risen markedly since 2000.
One solution may lie in the region’s traditional foods, such as quinoa, and tuberous root vegetables like mashua and melloco, among others. In addition to being healthier, traditional produce may also be able to resist the worst shocks of climate change.
“Many Andean cereals are heavily drought resistant,” Castro pointed out. “We’re working with smallholder farmers in very different areas with indigenous populations in Latin America and the Caribbean to bring back those foods to the table.”
In some cases, those foods may already be on the table. Traditional terrace farming in the Andes “is amazingly resilient,” said Carlos Andres Gallego-Riofrío, a research assistant professor at the University of Vermont. “It retains the moisture, it retains the fertility of the soil.”

Why protecting indigenous communities could help preserve our planet
Caliata, one of the farming communities he studied in central Ecuador, experiences low rates of chronic disease despite being “only 14 kilometers from the city.”
“They could buy Coca-Cola,” Gallego-Riofrío said. “They could buy whatever they want in the store, like any super processed food. Still, we barely see that in their diets.” Most of the food eaten in Caliata is grown by the families there, with plenty of tubers, beans, barley, and fruit rather than packaged foods bought elsewhere. The most popular meat is guinea pig, used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.
“In the Andean traditional systems, there’s so much to learn,” Gallego-Riofrío concluded. “There’s so much that can be transferred to other communities and we would see way better yields in terms of ecosystem and human health outcomes.”"

Extreme weather events like the LA wildfires are creating climate refugees. Where do they go?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/climate/la-fires-climate-refugees/index.html,"Extreme weather events like the LA wildfires are creating climate refugees. Where do they go?
Nic Arnzen can spot people who, like him, have lost their homes to the LA wildfires. “We have the same look in our eyes, the same zombie-like walk,” he said.
Arzen’s home in Altadena, a diverse community nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains, was consumed by the Eaton fire. He estimates tens of thousands of people have been displaced here and “half of them won’t have a home to come back to.” It’s overwhelming, said Arzen, who serves on the Altadena Town Council, “the impact is unimaginable.”
The wildfires that have incinerated whole neighborhoods across Los Angeles are among the most destructive and costliest in California’s history, destroying more than 60 square miles and killing at least 27 people.
Those displaced like Arnzen face a pressing question: What do we do now? Stay and rebuild homes and lives, hoping disaster won’t strike again, even as wildfire risk grows, or leave for somewhere perceived as safer?
The decisions people make about where they live are “extremely complex” and based on a slew of factors, said Jesse Keenan, associate professor of sustainable real estate and urban planning at Tulane University.
But as extreme weather supercharged by climate change fractures American lives, those in high-risk areas are being pushed to confront the reality that it’s getting harder and harder to insulate themselves from disaster.
Incinerated communities
California is America’s wildfire ground zero. “Fire is a part of living here,” said Kaitlyn Trudeau, a senior researcher at Climate Central, a non-profit research group. “It was here long before we were.”
People have learned to live with the risks, she told CNN, but the problem is fire behavior is changing, amplified by the climate crisis, which is driving hotter, drier conditions.
LA’s fires exploded as extraordinarily powerful Santa Ana winds swept across a landscape parched by extraordinary drought. They burned hotter and spread faster due to the sheer amount of vegetation after an uncommonly wet winter last year. The region’s extreme swing from wet to dry conditions is part of a phenomenon called “weather whiplash,” becoming more common as the world warms.
These ingredients — in addition to the city’s sprawl, which pushes outskirt neighborhoods into fire-prone wildlands — set the stage for immense destruction.
In just days, the flames incinerated not only homes but schools, daycares, grocery stores, cafes and workplaces. People have been cut off from their communities, Keenan said.
In the immediate aftermath of a disaster like this, many of those displaced stay with family and friends and tend to remain local, Keenan told CNN.
What happens longer-term will depend on a number of factors.
Past evidence suggests most of those displaced will eventually return to their communities, bound by strong ties to family, friends and jobs. “Climate refugees from LA are likely to look for housing in the same region,” said Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at the non-profit First Street Foundation.
But that doesn’t mean they’ll be able to go back to exactly where they were living.
For renters that will be “a near impossibility,” Keenan said, California’s housing market was already red hot, and the fires will add “extreme demands,” exacerbating an affordable housing crisis.
For homeowners it’s also fraught. Those with insurance likely have a long wait for claims to be processed and payouts could well fall short given the costs of rebuilding. “We simply do not have enough people and workers … to rebuild housing at the scale of these devastations,” Keenan said.
And that’s if rebuilding happens at all. In some areas, the state may step in to create buffer zones to act as fire breaks.
Then there are the costs of cleaning up toxic contamination from the cocktail of chemicals released as flames ate through electronics, metals, plastics and paints. It adds up to a lingering pollution, to which children are particularly vulnerable, Keenan said.
The fires will add a new dimension to the state’s already perilous insurance crisis. Insurers had been refusing to renew policies in high wildfire risk areas before this disaster. “We will (now) see huge increases in the cost of home insurance,” said Porter. Many homeowners “will no longer be able to make the economics of home ownership work,” he told CNN.
At the same time, as with every disaster, there will be “predatory property buyers coming in,” Keenan said. The new houses will likely be far more expensive than those they replace. It’s a well-trodden cycle: middle class housing “begins to evaporate” and “these areas actually become wealthier,” he said.
The disaster may even fuel “climate gentrification” where people move into lower income communities at less risk of fire and flood and displace those already there. There’s “this slow crowding out that happens when people can bid up on rent,” Keenan said.
No safe havens
While some of those displaced in LA may find their housing situation changed by forces beyond their control, others may choose to leave.
Even before the devastating fires, climate concerns were pushing some out. Peter Kalmus left Altadena in 2022, after living there for 14 years. “It felt like heat waves were getting more intense, drought was getting worse, fire was getting worse,” the climate scientist told CNN, and “it would only get hotter, drier and more fiery.”
There may be a small minority of people after LA’s fires who also take this route, those “shocked or traumatized enough” that they decide to move further afield, to somewhere they deem safer, said Alex de Sherbinin, a geographer at Columbia Climate School.
People often consider places like Buffalo, New York, Detroit and much of Ohio to be lower risk, said Kelsea Best, assistant professor at Ohio State University, who researches how people adapt to climate change.
These areas have ample water resources and are less prone to fires, hurricanes and extreme heat. But, she added, “there is no place in the US that has zero climate risk.”
This was starkly revealed last September when Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, in western North Carolina, a city previously billed as a “climate haven.”
Kalmus, who moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, knows “nowhere is safe” from global warming, especially after Helene, but his current home “feels less risky” than Southern California.
So far, there is relatively little evidence of large-scale climate migration from high risk states like California, said de Sherbinin. People’s resilience tends to be high, and memories short.
The question is, what happens when a previously unimaginable disaster like the LA fires strikes again, and again. The impacts can mount up, said de Sherbinin, affecting infrastructure, the local tax base, money available for services and climate adaptations. Communities become “a lot less viable,” he said.
In Altadena, Arnzen had always known the fire risk was there, but had tried to persuade himself it wouldn’t reach him. That sense of security is now gone. “This was traumatic. This is something we’re going to never recover from,” he said, and he faults no one who might seek safety elsewhere.
But he has no intention of leaving. He wants to be part of rebuilding Altadena to be more resilient to the fires he knows are likely to come again. “I have lost so much that all I can do is focus on and be determined to gain more than I’ve lost.”"

Eric Mauchan’s Cape Cod-style house in Framingham, Massachusetts, does not have central air conditioning. So when the summer heat bears down, his four window AC units, two dehumidifiers and fans that keep the 2,600-square-foot home cool push his electricity bill to roughly $200 a month.
In the depths of winter, the monthly cost of warming the home with gas soars to about $400. His wife, Jennifer, deploys a classic New England tactic to cut down on the energy bill: telling the family to add layers of clothing and blankets before she touches the thermostat.
“I am a stickler about the temperature, because I don’t want to pay the money to heat the house,” she told CNN. “So, if my 13-year-old son is cold, I’m like, ‘put on a sweatshirt, put on an extra pair of pants.’”
But all that is about to change, as the family joins a small-yet-growing group who are tapping into a network of underground energy to heat and cool their homes.
Massachusetts, like the rest of New England, still heavily relies on planet-warming fossil fuels for heating and cooling. But some energy companies are looking to an unlimited thermal energy source below their feet as a clean alternative.
The problem is, this option currently comes with a high up-front price tag, even with tax benefits factored in. Installing ground-source heat pumps alone, which do the work of converting underground energy into usable household heat, could cost tens of thousands of dollars. Additional costs could follow, depending on the house size, ductwork installation and other electrical service upgrades needed.
Over the long term, however, bills are expected to be much lower. Switching from gas hookups to networked geothermal heating could cut energy costs by 15 to 20%, Eversource estimates. It could also reduce the average residential customer’s carbon pollution in Massachusetts by up to 60%, utility estimates show.
When utility company Eversource announced it was building a geothermal network in Framingham — and offering no-cost retrofits to participating homeowners — the Mauchan family jumped at the chance. They would have otherwise needed to pay roughly $100,000 for home geothermal upgrades, Eric said.
Eversource has so far connected 37 homes and businesses in Framingham, including the fire station, into its shared geothermal loop.
The city now boasts the first shared geothermal network led by a gas utility in the nation, and it could be a model for the future of clean home heating and cooling. This winter will be the system’s first test.
How it works
The Earth is one big thermal battery. While the outside air temperature fluctuates with the weather, underground temperatures stay roughly 50 to 60 degrees. For most of the United States, temperatures are warmer underground in the winter and cooler in the summer. It’s a limitless renewable energy source that some experts say could help replace planet-warming fossil fuels.
To tap into Earth’s energy, Eversource drilled 88 boreholes about 600 feet below ground and installed an intricate system of horizontal and vertical underground pipes. The company runs a mixture of water and antifreeze through them.
During the winter, the liquid in the pipes is warmed by the relative heat underground, then carried up to a heat pump unit installed in the home. The heat pump concentrates the warmth and pumps it through the home’s ductwork to keep residents warm and cozy.
The process is reversed in the summer. Since the Earth’s temperature is cooler than the air inside the house, the heat pumps draw the warmth out of the house and into the ground.
It’s too early to know how much money switching to geothermal will save customers. Eversource needs at least one full heating cycle — this winter — to measure changes in customers’ bills. But Nikki Bruno, the vice president of clean technologies at Eversource, said she expects the geothermal system will reduce them.
“Cost is a huge driver,” she said. “We’re very sensitive to making sure that service is generally safe and reliable, but also cost-effective.”
Eversource will run the pilot system for two years, collecting data on energy use and costs, the system’s performance, and customer satisfaction. People will then have the option to either go back to the old gas system or stay on geothermal. The company also intends to transfer heat pump ownership to customers at no cost.
Experts said the project’s data will be important for the development of similar, future systems.
“The more data we get from utilities like Eversource, the better off we’re going to be so we can make informed decisions” about deploying more geothermal, Jeff Tester, professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University, told CNN.
Future of gas utilities
Eight states, including Massachusetts, have passed laws allowing public gas utilities to become “thermal utilities” — effectively allowing them to add geothermal systems in addition to gas.
Four more states — Illinois, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine – have introduced similar legislation that has yet to pass. Nearly 30 utility companies have expressed interest in the gas-to-geothermal business model, according to data from HEET, a Boston-based clean energy nonprofit that advised Eversource on the project.
“We are overheating everything around us,” Zeyneb Magavi, a scientist and co-executive director of HEET, told CNN. “The idea that we could build thermal networks as a simple infrastructure … and tap all of that excess thermal in the world stored around us, we have a win-win.”
Using networked geothermal technology for heating isn’t new in the US. Many college campuses such as Cornell and Princeton are heated with geothermal systems. The challenge is expanding it, Tester said.
“It’s definitely scalable, but it would take more work and more cooperation,” he said. “And we hope that will happen fast, because the benefits are long-term, and I think it could really pay off, moneywise.”
Tester also noted the geothermal network isn’t entirely free of fossil fuels. Eversource’s heat pumps are powered by the New England electricity grid, which still heavily relies on natural gas.
Back in the Mauchan household, they are optimistic about their years to come on geothermal — hopefully, with fewer layers this winter. Eric Mauchan said they are slowly getting rid of their AC units to prepare for geothermal cooling during the summer.
Eversource, which has a recent grant from Department of Energy and HEET, is already in talks to add more homes to the loop.
Jennifer Mauchan said her friends and neighbors are already asking her about how to get on it. “Everyone is envious about our situation,” she said, “asking when it is going to be expanded.”"

Most of the United States is being assailed with extreme winter weather this week as Arctic air blasts south from Canada, snow tracks up the Northeast coast and a potentially crippling winter storm takes aim at the South.
Travelers are facing delays Sunday and cold is in store for much of the nation, with more than 75% of the US expected to face freezing temperatures this week.
Over 70 million people are under winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings from Tennessee to Maine on Sunday. That means snow for many Northeast cities, as a low-pressure system will bring a quick shot of snow to the I-95 corridor from Virginia to Maine on Sunday through early Monday.
Washington, DC, is expected to see 1 to 3 inches of snow, with up to 6 inches expected in New York and Boston. Hartford, Connecticut, could see 5 to 7 inches of snow and Portland, Maine, could receive up to 8 inches. And in Philadelphia, where a snow emergency was declared Sunday evening, there could be 4-6 inches of snow and below freezing temperatures Sunday night.
A cold weather emergency has been activated in Washington, DC, mayor Muriel Bowser announced in a Sunday post on X. The mayor warned of “dangerously low” temperatures overnight. The frosty forecast prompted the announcement that President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration will be held indoors on Monday, the first inside presidential inauguration since Ronald Reagan in 1985.
There may be fewer seats, and less of a spectacle, but Donald Trump says safety is paramount, and he will attend an indoor rally with supporters afterward at a downtown DC arena.

At least 1,100 flights into or out of the US were canceled by Sunday evening with another 5,017 delayed, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Over 20% of flights into or out of Newark Liberty International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled, the site shows.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency due to the storm.
“As always, I urge all New Jerseyans to use caution, follow all safety protocols, and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary,” Murphy said on X Saturday.
Meanwhile, the South is bracing for a rare winter storm with a still-uncertain forecast. Louisiana declared a state of emergency and Texas has directed state agencies to mobilize resources due to the threat of snow.
In Houston, Texas, both civilian airports will be closed all day on Tuesday, mayor John Whitmire announced at a Sunday evening news conference. Schools in the Houston Independent School District — the largest in the state and the eighth-largest in the country — will also be closed until Wednesday, Whitmire said.
The city could see up to 5 inches of snow starting Monday night, according to National Weather Service Houston, which warned of “freezing rain” and icy roads making for dangerous travel conditions into midday Wednesday. Below-freezing overnight temperatures are expected to continue from Sunday through Friday, says the agency.
Dangerous cold for millions
Arctic air spreads across much of the US this week, and for some states, the extreme cold could last for days. Nearly 150 million people are under cold weather alerts with forecasters warning of potential frozen pipes, frostbite and travel delays.
More than two dozen record lows are possible this week including in Cleveland, Kansas City, and Houston as temperatures will drop 20 to 30 degrees below normal.
Denver is forecast to have a high temperature of only 9 degrees Monday, a staggering 36 degrees cooler than their normal high of 45.
Southern cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Memphis and Birmingham may not even reach a high temperature above freezing Monday and Tuesday.
“An extended period of freezing temperatures could cause ruptured water pipes,” the National Weather Service in Atlanta warned.
Houston’s mayor similarly urged residents to protect their water pipes before the frigid temperatures hit. “Let me emphasize the preparation of your pipes,” Whitmire said Sunday. “Wrap your pipes if all possible.”
The mayor said that he was “convinced that we are about to experience a very serious and dangerous weather episode.”
He urged residents to stay inside, to check on vulnerable neighbors and family members, and to utilize one of the city’s 24-hour warming centers. Officials are doing “everything we can” to encourage homeless people to seek refuge in warming centers, he added.
Wind is also a huge factor in the cold. Wind speeds of 15 to 25 mph, along with the already very cold temperatures, will lead to wind chills of minus 25 to 50 below zero at times from Sunday to Tuesday across the Midwest and Northern Plains. These conditions could cause frostbite on exposed skin in less than 10 minutes.
‘Rare, significant winter storm’ for South
More than 30 million people from Texas to Georgia are under winter storm watches in preparation for a rare winter storm across the Gulf Coast and Southeast this week.
The impacts from the significant storm will begin in Texas on Monday, the Weather Prediction Center said, adding that major traffic and travel disruptions are likely through mid-week.
A wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected near and south of the Interstate 20 corridor with potentially heavy snow or sleet in some areas. The sleet and freezing rain could stretch as far south as the Interstate 10 corridor.
The latest forecast shows the potential for at least 3 inches of snow in Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana; Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Macon, Georgia; Montgomery, Alabama and Houston, Texas.
Ice accumulations could also lead to power outages and downed trees.

An already active winter is about to shift into overdrive as a trio of storms over the weekend and into next week deliver snow to the Midwest, East and possibly as far south as the Gulf Coast.
It’s all happening because the coldest air of the season is working its way over most of the US. The Arctic air from Siberia will even reach southern areas usually spared from such bitter cold.
Forecasts for two of the three upcoming winter storms are tricky and more uncertain than usual. But the forecast for the first storm is clear cut.
It will drop a mix of rain and 1 to 3 inches of snow over parts of the Midwest and Interior Northeast Saturday before it exits by Sunday morning. It will impact cities including Indianapolis, Detroit and Cleveland Saturday morning before bringing the same mix of snow and rain into the interior Northeast by the afternoon.
Another, potentially more potent storm will form in the central Appalachians as soon as the last one departs. It will strengthen quickly while spreading wintry slop over the mid-Atlantic and into southern New York and southern New England Sunday afternoon. Precipitation will spread north through the remainder of New York and New England over the rest of Sunday. Snow will fall in more inland locations while rain mixes in with the snow at times closer to the coast.
At least three states, including two in the southern US, declared states of emergency on Saturday due to the threat of snow.
In New Jersey, a state of emergency will take effect on Sunday morning, Gov. Phil Murphy said in a social media post.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry also issued an emergency declaration Saturday and encouraged people “to stay alert, monitor the weather forecast, and prepare now for any potential impacts.”
Officials in Texas began mobilizing state resources Saturday to assist with winter weather preparations, according to a news release from the Texas Division of Emergency Management.
Exactly how much snow piles up Sunday, particularly in the heavily populated and highly traveled Interstate-95 corridor, depends on how close to the coast the storm travels.
Current forecasts show it staying just off the coast as it moves north through Sunday night which could bring widespread amounts of 1 to 3 inches of snow from Washington, DC, north to New England. Higher amounts of 3 to 6 inches are more likely just west of the I-95 corridor.
If the storm tracks closer to the coast than currently expected, it could tap into additional moisture and snow amounts could increase by a few inches — even for areas closer to the coast like New York City and Boston.
The storm will wrap up by Monday morning everywhere except far northern New England. The coldest air of the season and breezy conditions will arrive in its wake. Temperatures Monday from New England to the Southeast will be anywhere from 15 to just over 30 degrees below normal for what’s already the coldest time of the year.
Temperatures in Washington, DC, will drop into the teens Sunday night and will be stuck in the 20s Monday, so whatever snow falls Sunday will stick around for the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years. Fresh snow on the ground, bitterly cold air and wind gusts to 30 mph at times will generate wind chills — what the air feels like when combined with wind — in the single digits for the entire day.
Unusually far south snow?
Confidence is growing in another round of winter weather in the South next week after snow and ice brought the region to a standstill last week.
This southern storm could develop much farther south than the last. Normally, a storm like this would bring rain to the Gulf Coast’s I-10 corridor, but the intense cold spreading over the country will open the door for winter weather there.
A wintry mix could begin in central Texas as early as Monday evening and increase in coverage and intensity by Tuesday morning. Some snow, sleet and freezing rain could expand east throughout Tuesday along the I-10 corridor and potentially farther north into more of the Southeast — possibly including northern Florida — overnight.
Almost every element of the forecast — timing, location, precipitation type and intensity — is soaked in uncertainty and won’t be settled until the exact track of the storm is locked into by forecast models over the weekend.
It’s hard to overstate how rare accumulating snow is in the Deep South, particularly along the Gulf Coast. So even a small chance of snow or ice is significant for the region.
Measurable snow has only happened a dozen times at Houston’s Hobby Airport since 1932 and eight times since 1948 in New Orleans and 1940 in Tallahassee, Florida. All three locations have a chance at it next week."

Winter’s most potent Arctic blast yet is about to unleash dangerously low temperatures that will be the coldest to hit the United States in a year.
The cold will arrive this weekend and looks to be longer-lasting and more expansive than last January’s outbreak of Arctic air that, among other dangers, created one of the coldest-ever NFL games and the coldest Iowa caucuses on record.
Before the frigid air arrives, a short-lived warmup will encompass much of the Central US Thursday and Friday. It’ll be the first stretch since the start of the year that cities like Oklahoma City and Kansas City, Missouri, record above-average temperatures. But the tease of warmth will only make the extreme cold that follows feel more intense.
Brutally cold air from Siberia, near the Arctic Circle, will sink south over Canada late this week and rush into the northern US by the earliest hours of Saturday morning. It’ll then expand over much of the West and Central US Saturday and reach parts of the South and East Sunday. Temperatures could be almost 30 degrees below normal by Monday for millions across the Lower 48 in what’s already the coldest part of the year.
The most extreme cold will settle over the Dakotas later this weekend into early next week.
Bismarck, North Dakota, hasn’t had a below zero high temperature since last January, but that could happen on both Sunday and Monday. Low temperatures in the northern part of the state could bottom out between 25 to 30 degrees below zero by Monday morning.
Breezy winds will arrive along with the cold and send wind chills to a life-threatening 40 to nearly 50 below zero in North Dakota Monday morning. Wind chills this severe can cause frostbite on exposed skin in 10 minutes or less, according to the National Weather Service.
Single-digit wind chills will cover most of the US Monday morning and are possible as far west as Nevada, as far south as Texas and as far east as Maine.
Monday will likely be the coldest day of the season so far for Dallas with the high temperature only climbing a few degrees above freezing. It’ll also be Chicago’s coldest day of the year with the high temperature likely only reaching around 10 degrees.
Cold air will also blast the East Coast and Southeast Monday. High temperatures in the single digits and teens are likely in northern New England with 30s and 40s from the mid-Atlantic to much of the Southeast.
Tuesday could be just as cold, if not colder for some, especially in the East and South.
The cold could also support some wintry precipitation in the South early next week, but it’s still too soon to know exactly what areas – if any – get another round of messy weather so soon after the last.
Cold will crash multiple events
The divisional round of the NFL playoffs will kick off just as the cold arrives in the same areas.
The temperature will be in the 20s for the Saturday mid-afternoon kickoff between the Houston Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs in Kansas City, Missouri, but the wind chill will hover in the low teens for kickoff and throughout the game.
Frostbite and hypothermia are serious risks in wind chills this cold, especially with fans exposed in the open-air stadium for several hours. Last January’s infamously cold game in Kansas City was played with wind chills more than 20 below zero. Dozens of people showed signs of hypothermia and more than a dozen were transported to local hospitals for care.
Brutal cold is also in store for Sunday’s Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills matchup in Orchard Park, New York. Temperatures will be in the upper teens for the early evening kickoff and fall several degrees from there. Wind chills will be in the single digits for the entire game.
The coldest air of the season will slink into Washington, DC, on Monday for Inauguration Day for President-elect Donald Trump. A high 15 degrees below normal in the upper 20s is expected. It’ll be the coldest Inauguration Day since former President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009 when the temperature topped out at 30 degrees."

The fires that have ravaged Los Angeles over the past week were larger and burned hotter than they would have in a world without planet-warming fossil fuel pollution, a new analysis suggests.
Climate change could be blamed for around 25% of the fuel available for the fires, according to the rapid research from scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles. The report is clear in saying the fires likely still would have occurred in a world without climate pollution, but it concludes they would have been “somewhat smaller and less intense.”
The result raises the question of whether the fires could have been controllable were it not for the fire-fueling effects of climate change. The UCLA scientists refer to their analysis as a “starting point” for deeper studies.
Twelve fires have ignited in the Los Angeles area since January 7, when a once-in-a-decade Santa Ana wind storm blew across Southern California’s drought-parched landscape. Since then, more than 60 square miles have been charred and more than 12,000 structures have burned, such as homes, businesses, sheds and garages.
Four days after they began, the Eaton and Palisades fires had grown enough that CalFire ranked them the first and second-most destructive in Southern California history.
Some of the climate-related factors that contributed to the increase in available fire fuel were the excessive moisture of previous winters, Southern California’s abnormally warm summer and fall and a severely delayed rainy season so far in the winter of 2024-2025.
Two winters in a row, downtown Los Angeles recorded twice as much rain as a normal winter, researchers noted. This in itself is a calling card of human-caused climate change, which promotes more moisture in the atmosphere, leading to larger rainfall totals in the wettest years. The rain spurred the growth of “substantially more” grasses and shrubs than normal. The vegetation in the Los Angeles region was among the greenest since 2000, they noted.
When the weather pendulum swung over to dry last summer, the grasses and shrubs — what Southern California wildfires feed on — began to dry out. The exceptionally late onset of the rainy season contributed even more to that drying.
Southern California’s status quo is extreme swings between dry and wet, the UCLA researchers noted, but the lack of rainfall since May 2024 was exceptional. At only 0.29 inches of rain between May 1, 2024 and January 8, the period ranks second-driest behind 1962-1963, with records dating back to 1877.
By the time the first fires ignited, the moisture in the dead vegetation was 6th-lowest on record, according to the report.

These massive swings from dry to wet to dry conditions — known as “weather whiplash” — are becoming more frequent as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution, CNN previously reported. These swings worsen the severity and chances of hazards like wildfires and flash floods.
While the extremely dry conditions were enough to fuel a dangerous fire, this event was also sparked in part by an unusually strong Santa Ana wind event. The UCLA researchers found the winds were “indeed a highly unusual Santa Ana event, though perhaps not entirely unprecedented.” They also noted there is no physical explanation for how a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution could lead to more extreme Santa Ana winds.
The researchers concluded that given the clear connection between wildfire size and intensity, and knowing that fires will continue to get worse as the planet warms, the focus should be on “aggressive suppression” during high wildfire risk, strategies to prevent homes from catching fire easily and avoiding high-risk zones when developing new urban areas.
January is typically Southern California’s second-wettest month. February is its wettest. The forecast for Los Angeles suggests the prospect of a completely dry January. At the very least, below-normal rainfall is expected to persist into February."

An international research team has successfully drilled and retrieved a 9,186-foot-long (2,800-meter-long) ice core from Antarctica that dates back 1.2 million years. The sample extended so deep that it reached the bedrock beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
The core, nearly as long as 25 soccer fields end to end or six and a half times taller than the Empire State Building to the very tip of its antenna, is a “time machine” that captures “an extraordinary archive of Earth’s climate,” said Carlo Barbante, coordinator of the Beyond EPICA, or European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica, team that collected the core.
The team has sliced the core into 3.2-foot (1-meter) pieces stored in insulated boxes so they may be studied, said Barbante, professor at Italy’s Ca’ Foscari University of Venice and senior associate member of the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy.
The core was collected from Little Dome C, one of the harshest and most extreme locations on the planet. The site is 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the Italian-French Concordia research station and is constantly slammed with strong wind gusts and near-constant temperatures below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius).
The ice, some of the oldest drilled on Earth, could provide answers to the biggest remaining questions about how the planet’s climate has changed over time.
“The air bubbles trapped within the ice core provide a direct snapshot of past atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gas concentrations like carbon dioxide and methane,” Barbante said via email. “By analyzing these, we can reconstruct how Earth’s climate responded to changes in climate forcing factors, such as solar radiation, volcanic activity, and orbital variations. This data helps us understand the intricate relationship between greenhouse gases and global temperature over hundreds of thousands of years and now down to 1.2 million year(s) and hopefully beyond.”
Scientists are also hoping the ice will shed light on what caused the timing of Earth’s ice ages to shift suddenly about 1 million years ago, an event that nearly caused the extinction of ancient human ancestors, according to recent research.
Researchers collected the core during the fourth campaign of the Beyond EPICA — Oldest Ice project, funded by the European Commission. The campaign took place over the most recent Antarctic summer between mid-November to mid-January. Overall, experts from 12 European scientific institutions have spent more than 200 days drilling and processing the ice during the last four summers.
The program builds on the goals of the initial EPICA project that took place from 1996 to 2008. During that time, researchers drilled a deep ice core that unearthed links between climate and atmospheric greenhouse gases over the past 800,000 years. The core collected during the latest campaign marks a new milestone, creating a continuous record of Earth’s climate that dates back even further.
Studies of the original EPICA core showed that Earth’s climate experienced a 100,000-year cycle of cold glacial periods, or ice ages, interspersed with warmer periods. But this finding didn’t match up with marine sediments that revealed Earth once experienced 41,000-year glacial periods prior to 1 million years ago.
The Beyond EPICA project began in 2016 with the goal of finding older ice that could point to why this shift occurred, and the search for the right site started with the use of radar surveys.
Radio echo sounding technologies helped team members zero in on ice that might contain the time capsule they were looking for, said Frank Wilhelms, principal investigator in the field and joint professor at Göttingen University and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.
“We needed a Goldilocks site — ice thick enough for a well-resolved climate record at the greatest depth, but not too thick that the oldest ice had already melted away,” said Dr. Robert Mulvaney, a glaciologist and paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey.
“This can happen when the heat escaping from the Earth’s mantle is trapped by a thick insulating blanket of ice. If the ice is too thick, we can lose the lowest and oldest layers of ice to melting,” Mulvaney said. “That’s why we spent a lot of effort in surveying the candidate areas to find the right site before drilling started.”
Little Dome C is high on the central Antarctic plateau, reaching an altitude of 10,498 feet (3,200 meters) above sea level, presenting numerous challenges. The team had to work to prevent drill failures and ensure that the electromechanical core drill  was progressing through the ice layers. Each meter of ice can contain as many as 13,000 years of climate data, said Julien Westhoff, chief scientist in the field and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.
When the team members retrieved the core, they found what they were looking for. The bottommost 688 feet (210 meters) of the core above the bedrock consists of old ice that has been heavily deformed, likely mixed, refrozen and of unknown origin, the team said.
Analyzing the ice could help to test theories about how it refroze beneath the ice sheet. Researchers will also determine whether even older ice, such as that from the pre-Quaternary Period 2.58 million years ago, is present and provide dating of the rocks beneath the ice to determine when this Antarctic region was last ice-free.
“It was exciting to see the ice age as we drilled deeper, and especially when we knew we were drilling ice older than the EPICA record, which ended at 800,000 years ago,” the British Antarctic Survey’s Mulvaney said in a statement. “This record of 1.2 million years will give us several 41,000-year glacial cycles to compare with the more recent data from the original EPICA core.”
The Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which occurred between 1.2 million and 900,000 years ago, marks the fundamental shift in Earth’s glacial cycles, Barbante said.
“This transition remains a scientific mystery, particularly regarding the role of greenhouse gases and ice sheet dynamics,” he said. “The Beyond EPICA ice core offers an unprecedented opportunity to directly measure atmospheric conditions during this pivotal period, potentially unlocking answers about why this transition occurred and how it shaped our planet’s climate system.”
During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, ice ages became longer and more intense, leading to a drop in temperature and dry climatic conditions. The global population also dropped to about 1,280 reproducing individuals between 930,000 and 813,000 years ago and then remained that small for about 117,000 years, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Science. The study authors argue this event “brought human ancestors close to extinction,” but others are more skeptical.
Regardless, the ice core could contain evidence as to why the shift in the length of ice age periods occurred.
Ice cores contain layers of snowfall that have been compressed over time, trapping air bubbles and particles that can be analyzed to reveal how Earth’s temperature and atmosphere have shifted.
They could help scientists understand how Earth’s climate has behaved in the past to better predict how things may change in the future — and provide context on how our planet responds to different greenhouse gas concentrations.
“Antarctic ice cores are like Rosetta Stones,” said Jim White, Craver Family Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. “They are unique in that they speak the language of temperature as well as the language of (carbon dioxide) levels, allowing us to see how these two key climate variables interact.”
White was not involved in retrieving the ice core. But he said the ice has the potential to yield a great deal of information “about the fundamental dynamics of climate change on our planet, and the importance of that cannot be overstated.”
While preliminary analysis occurred at the site, the ice core slices will be transported back to Europe aboard the icebreaker ship Laura Bassi in specialized cold containers to maintain the perfect temperature. Barbante anticipates that the research will be a multiyear endeavor as scientists take a deep dive into measuring concentrations of gas and dust particles within the ice.
Meanwhile, the Beyond EPICA project, as well as other international associations, will search for older ice that could reveal longer climate records. But such efforts will require more advanced technology and planning, Barbante said.
“We have to find other places in Antarctica where we can retrieve continuous climate record(s) similar to the one we are studying,” he said."

It’s official: 2024 was the hottest year on record, breaking the previous record set in 2023 and pushing the world over a critical climate threshold, according to new data from Europe’s climate monitoring agency Copernicus.
Last year was 1.6 degrees hotter than the period before humans began burning large amounts of fossil fuels, Copernicus found. It makes 2024 the first calendar year to breach the 1.5-degree limit countries agreed to avoid under the Paris climate agreement in 2015.
Scientists are much more concerned about breaches over decades, rather than single years — as above that threshold humans and ecosystems may struggle to adapt — but 2024’s record “does mean we’re getting dangerously close,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London.
The Copernicus analysis points to a slew of climate records falling last year: The planet endured its hottest day on record in July; each month from January to June was the warmest such month on record; and levels of planet-heating pollution reached unprecedented highs.
Last year is part of a pattern of off-the-charts heat. Every single one of the world’s 10 hottest years happened in the last decade, according to Copernicus data.
Behind these statistics lies a huge toll. “Every fraction of a degree … brings more harm to people and ecosystems,” Rogelj said.
The extreme weather that swept the globe last year shows just how dangerous life in a warmer world already is.
Back-to-back hurricanes in the US, fueled by ultra-warm ocean temperatures, killed hundreds of people. In Spain, more than 200 people died in catastrophic floods. Amazon rivers fell to unprecedented lows during the region’s worst drought on record and the Philippines experienced an extraordinary typhoon season, with six in just 30 days.
The climate crisis played a role in all of these extreme events, according to scientific analyses.
Scientists are still trying to fully understand why global heat has been so extreme for the past two years.
The main driver is clear: the human-caused climate crisis, boosted by El Niño, a natural climate pattern that tends to have a warming influence, which began in 2023 and ended earlier this year. But it doesn’t explain all of the heat.
Scientists have also pointed to a recent drop in shipping pollution following regulations — a win for human health, but, in a cruel twist, this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space.
The eruption of a huge underwater volcano in the South Pacific in 2022, which sent plumes of water vapor — a potent greenhouse gas — into the atmosphere may have also contributed.
Then there are the clouds. A December study found a dearth of sun-reflecting clouds over the ocean may be another factor.
Scientists believe it’s unlikely 2025 will be another record-breaking year. La Niña, a natural climate pattern that tends to have a global cooling influence, was declared Thursday.
“But people shouldn’t think that’s climate change hitting pause or plateauing,” said Paulo Ceppi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “A small dip doesn’t change the clear upward trajectory we’re on,” he added.
Scientists say the decades to come are likely to be hotter still as humans continue to burn planet-heating coal, oil and gas.
“The world doesn’t need to come up with a magical solution to stop things from getting worse in 2025,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. ‘We know exactly what we need to do to transition away from fossil fuels.”"
La Niña has arrived. Here’s what that means for the US,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/weather/la-nina-winter-spring-forecast-climate/index.html,"La Niña has arrived. Here’s what that means for the US

La Niña has finally emerged after months of anticipation, but there’s a catch. The climate pattern — which typically has an outsized influence on winter weather in the US — is rather weak and may not stick around for long.
But that won’t totally eliminate its effect. And, despite its late arrival, it’s already played a clear role in this winter’s weather.
Forecasters closely monitor La Niña and its counterpart El Niño because they influence global weather in a way that’s largely consistent and predictable well in advance – especially when the patterns are strong.
Last winter was the warmest on record for the US and was dominated by a very strong ”super” El Niño. This winter is different: Not only is La Niña much weaker than last year’s potent El Niño, it’s also arriving really late to the party. Both exert their greatest influence on weather in the winter months, and this La Niña has already lost a lot of time, according to Emily Becker, a research professor at the University of Miami.
“It is really getting started right at the time when it would normally be peaking (in strength) and beginning to dwindle,” Becker, who is also one of the main authors of NOAA’s La Niña/El Niño blog, explained.
That doesn’t mean its effect on US winter weather is down for the count.
The phenomenon is marked by cooler than average water temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, along with corresponding changes in upper atmosphere patterns — and these changes influence weather globally.
The atmosphere started to look La Niña-like in the fall, but ocean temperatures didn’t really look like La Niña until the end of the year, Becker explained.
So, despite the timing and its weakened state, La Niña’s atmospheric influence has already been apparent this winter.
California is the most obvious example. Winter in Northern California is typically wetter during La Niña while the southern half of the state is drier than normal. Those extremes are playing out in a major way: Northern California has had plenty of rain while Southern California is so tinder-dry that thousands of acres ignited this week.

La Niña also typically delivers more precipitation to the Midwest. Multiple major Midwest cities — including St. Louis, Indianapolis and Cincinnati — are having one of the wettest starts to winter to date, according to data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center.
But there are also exceptions that prove La Niña is not the only factor at play this season.
The South and parts of the central US are typically drier and warmer than normal during a La Niña winter, but that’s been far from the case for at least the past few weeks. Periods of brutally cold Arctic air have dominated the eastern two-thirds of the country since December and winter storms have delivered disruptive weather on a weekly basis since the year began.
The weak La Niña is forecast to stick around through April before yielding once again to so-called neutral — not La Niña or El Niño — conditions, according to the Climate Prediction Center.
Trends for the rest of winter and into the early spring are still showing La Niña’s influence but it’s not guaranteed the season will play out exactly like a typical La Niña.
“If La Niña were stronger, I would have more confidence … that the rest of the winter would closely resemble La Niña’s expected impact,” Becker explained, noting that the weaker La Niña leaves room for other atmospheric factors to exert influence.
Despite this, warmer than normal temperatures are expected to win out over much of the southern tier of the US and East from January through March, according to the CPC. Cooler than normal conditions are anticipated for some northwestern states, also typical of La Niña.
Wetter than normal conditions likely continue in the Northwest and Midwest and parts of the Northeast through March. More precipitation coupled with colder weather could be a recipe for bouts of snow into early spring. Much of the southern US is expected to end up drier than normal, but parts of the Mississippi Valley and Southeast could be the exception.
La Niña’s arrival was a long time coming
Long-range forecasters at the CPC first raised the possibility of a switch to La Niña back in February 2024 when El Niño was still very strong. At the time, experts thought La Niña would arrive over the summer or fall and increase hurricane activity in the Atlantic.
El Niño finally lost its grip on global weather in June, but La Niña’s arrival was delayed repeatedly, leaving an extended period of neutral conditions in place through the summer and fall. It turned out hurricane season didn’t need La Niña in order to deliver devastating impacts anyway.
The delay likely ties back to global ocean temperatures, which have been far above average for more than a year, according to Becker. Global air temperatures were also extreme in 2024, which will likely be the first year on record to smash a critical warming limit.
It proved difficult for the equatorial Pacific to cool off into a La Niña phase when the surrounding oceans and atmosphere retained so much exceptional heat."

Follow:
A disruptive winter storm will soon paint the South with snow, ice and rain as the eastern two-thirds of the United States grapples with the coldest air of the season.
Unusually cold temperatures have dipped deep into the South and will allow the storm to put out a few inches of snow and dangerous ice over a nearly 1,400 mile section of the South from North Texas to the North Carolina coast, threatening major to extreme impacts in a region less adapted to winter weather.
Around 80,000 homes and businesses from Missouri to Virginia were still without power Wednesday morning after the last winter storm, according to PowerOutage.us. Some have been without power since Sunday, enduring the dangerous cold temperatures that are cold even for the coldest month of the year.
Spotty wintry weather from the new storm will begin Wednesday night in western Texas with light snow and freezing drizzle as the storm organizes. Thursday will be the most impactful day for winter weather for much of the southern Plains as the storm hits its stride.
Snow and sleet could begin around sunrise Thursday in northern Texas, including in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and continue through Thursday night. Some freezing rain could mix in during the afternoon as temperatures briefly climb just above freezing.
A similar mix will begin Thursday morning in Oklahoma and Arkansas. More mixing will keep snow totals a bit lower than initially forecast but will also create hazardous conditions by introducing ice to a larger population.
Any amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer — even a tenth of an inch — can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control, like what occurred over the weekend in the central US.
At least moderate impacts from the storm are expected in parts of Texas and Oklahoma given the threat for snow and ice, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index. A few areas could encounter major or even extreme impacts from this storm, meaning considerable disruptions to daily life and dangerous travel conditions are likely.
Frigid temperatures will increase power demands in Texas but grid conditions are expected to be normal, ERCOT — the operator responsible for the state’s electrical grid — said in a weather watch issued Sunday. The state’s grid failed during 2021’s disastrous winter storm and prolonged deep freeze, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 people.
Rain and perhaps a few embedded thunderstorms will soak central and south Texas, including Austin and Houston, Thursday. Flooding is possible, especially in coastal Texas where heavy thunderstorms that bubble to life just off the coast could slowly push ashore.
The storm will track farther east Thursday night and Friday and bring messy winter weather to much of the South. Small shifts in its track are still possible and could change snow and ice outcomes.
Snow totals will be highest from far northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma through Tennessee and the southern Appalachians. Several inches of snow could fall across this area and eclipse half a foot in spots from central Arkansas to the southern Appalachians.
Northern portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia could record 3 inches or more of snow from Thursday night through Friday night. Some of these areas could start as snow but change over to an icy mix as warmer air enters the area.
This will likely be the case in Atlanta, which hasn’t had at least an inch of snow in nearly seven years, but has a moderate chance of it with this storm. Precipitation begins as snow early Friday morning but will mix with freezing rain in the afternoon through the evening as temperatures warm to near freezing.
Precipitation quickly expands east Friday night as the storm approaches the Atlantic Coast and a mix of snow and ice will reach the Carolinas. Charlotte, North Carolina, hasn’t recorded measurable snow – at least 0.1 inch – in nearly two years but likely breaks that snow drought by this weekend.
Early forecasts hinted at the possibility that the storm could deliver significant snow to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by the weekend, but that scenario is appearing less likely. Still, a separate storm diving south out of Canada could work in tandem with the southern storm to pull moisture north and spread precipitation to much of the East.
A quick round of snow totaling 1 to 3 inches or less is possible for much of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday night into early Saturday morning. The storm quickly clears out of the East Saturday morning, leaving gusty winds in its wake, especially near the coast.

Follow:
More than 60 million people are under winter alerts nationwide, with a powerful weather system expected to bring a potent mix of snow, ice and blizzard conditions, accompanied by winds gusting up to 50 mph.
The winter storm, which has already caused snowy and icy conditions in the Central Plains, will create treacherous travel conditions and potential power outages across a vast region stretching from Kansas to the mid-Atlantic.
“For some, this could be the heaviest snowfall in over a decade,” NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center warned.
Major effects, including “considerable disruptions to daily life … dangerous or impossible driving conditions and widespread closures,” are expected from this storm through Monday in parts of the Central and Eastern US, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index.
What to expect when
Of the 60 million people under winter alerts, nearly 4 million are under blizzard warnings across much of eastern Kansas and western Missouri, with a dangerous combination of snow, ice and freezing rain ongoing across Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois and Indiana and western Kentucky. In addition, thundersnow and thundersleet are being observed.
Throughout the day, the storm will spread east into the Ohio River Valley, then reach the mid-Atlantic later Sunday into much of Monday.
Ice could cause hazardous conditions
Meanwhile, an ice storm warning remains in effect until noon CST Monday for areas of southern Illinois, western Kentucky and southeast Missouri. Travel of any kind in those areas is “strongly discouraged,” as the bridges and overpasses are likely to “become slick and hazardous,” according to the Weather Service.
The greatest risk of dangerous ice will set up just south of the snowiest areas. Significant icing is possible from Kansas and Missouri through the central Appalachians and potentially parts of Maryland and Delaware.
The National Weather Service said “significant icing” is expected.
“Total snow and sleet accumulations up to two inches and ice accumulations between one quarter and three quarters of an inch,” The National Weather Service said. “Persons should delay all travel if possible. If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution and be prepared for sudden changes in visibility.”
The weather service in Topeka, Kansas, warned against traveling in the icy conditions.
“If you are thinking about hitting the road today, think again. Snowplows are getting stuck. Emergency vehicles are getting stuck. If you get stuck, it may be over 24 hours until someone can get to you,” the National Weather Service office in Topeka said on X. “Temperatures will fall below zero tonight. Do not risk it.”
Motorist Mike Cho told CNN the winter storm left him stranded as he tried to drive to Colorado Springs from Kansas City on Saturday afternoon.
He encountered multiple wrecks and was stalled in traffic for two hours just outside of Salina, Kansas. “Two semi-trucks jackknifed and blocked a westbound lane on Interstate 70,” Cho said. After turning back and overnighting in Abilene, he found himself still stuck.
“Snow is everywhere,” Cho said in a video Sunday morning. “I pray to God I can get home tomorrow.”
The Kansas Turnpike Authority posted photos on X of crashed vehicles near Andover on Sunday afternoon.
“Cabin fever must be setting in based upon the dozen or so crashes in the last few hours,” it said. “Snow plow and trooper’s vehicle also hit; luckily no injuries.” The authority advised residents to shelter in place as “it sure beats waiting on help to rescue you.”
James Pritchett told CNN he’s been stuck at a truck stop in Faucett, Missouri, since Saturday night.
“Conditions are getting a little worse here,” Pritchett said.
Pritchett said he had left Iowa and was traveling on Interstate 29 when the winter storm forced him to pull off the road with his truck and trailer to get somewhere safe.
Ice amounts of 0.25 inches or more are possible, especially in parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana and almost all of Kentucky.
Any amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer – a light glaze to just over 0.10 inches – can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control.
Power outages could be widespread and long-lasting if significant icing occurs and power restoration crews can’t navigate treacherous roads. The situation could be dangerous or potentially deadly for those without access to heat in the extreme cold to come.
States prepare
Ahead of the storm, the governors of Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas, Missouri and New Jersey declared states of emergency, while Maryland’s governor declared a state of preparedness.
“This winter storm will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages – just 24 hours before it gets dangerously cold,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said, according to a release from his office.
Beshear posted on X Sunday, ordering all state office buildings will be closed Monday “due to inclement weather.”
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said a state of emergency would take effect in parts of the state from 10 p.m. “Throughout our state, we are experiencing severe winter weather resulting in hazardous conditions, with snowfall expected to reach a high of six to eight inches in our southern counties,” Murphy said in a statement.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin advised those with post-holiday travel plans to consider leaving on Saturday instead of Sunday, given the projected size of the storm.
“I’m encouraging all Virginians, visitors, and travelers to stay alert, monitor the weather forecast, and prepare now for any potential impacts,” Youngkin said Friday.
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s office said in a Saturday news release the state is preparing for the storm, which will “likely affect roads and transportation centers and could cause significant snow accumulation in some parts of the state.”
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly “issued a verbal state of disaster emergency proclamation,” Saturday afternoon, citing severe winter weather as a cause for concern, according to a news release.
North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday afternoon his state is prepared for the storm. “We’re braced for whatever comes our way.”
He said the storm comes at a time when western North Carolina is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, noting 8,000 bridges need repairs, keeping homeowners isolated from their communities. “We need to help them to reconnect to their property,” along with emergency services.
The winter storm is due to hit Washington, DC, overnight as Congress prepares to certify the 2024 presidential election results Monday.
Mayor Muriel Bowser told a news conference Sunday afternoon the top priority is getting the city fully opened as soon as possible and urged people to give snowplow teams space to work. “If you don’t need to be on the roads tonight and tomorrow, stay home. Please stay off our roads,” she said.
US federal government offices in Washington, DC, will be closed Monday due to snow, according to the Office of Personnel Management.  The closure will not affect Congress.
Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN the city was encouraging people to stay home and preparing as best it could for the storm, with freezing rain setting in.
“We’ve been plowing and salting the roads all day. We have over 200 people that are working hard on our snow team across the entire city,” he said.
“We’re going to keep at it with the freezing temperatures that are projected for the entire week. This is a particularly challenging storm, but we’re going to stay at it.”
The local power company had 1,000 people on standby to work on outages, he said.
As of Sunday night, more than 120,000 customers were without power in the central US, according to PowerOutage.us. About 31,700 of those affected were in Missouri and 900 in Kansas. Another approximately 51,100 customers were without power in Kentucky, 33,800 in Illinois, 1,400 in Indiana and 1,200 in Ohio, according to the site.
On Saturday, a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper pleaded for people to not go on the roads as crashes had been reported.
“Please please please, stay home. This is not the time to go out and venture and take in the sights and see the scenery,” Trooper Ben Gardner said on X. “This is the time when we stay home.”
More than 1,700 flights around the US had been canceled and more than 7,600 delayed Sunday as of 9:30 p.m. ET, per flight tracking site FlightAware.
At Kansas City International Airport, 94% of outbound flights and 90% of inbound flights were canceled, according to the website. The airport reopened runways after temporarily halting flights on Saturday due to ice.
More than half of outgoing flights and incoming flights at St. Louis Lambert International Airport were canceled by Sunday afternoon, according to FlightAware.
At Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, 27% of outbound flights – 46 flights – and 48% of inbound flights, or 76 flights, were canceled, FlightAware said.
At Columbia Regional Airport in Columbia, Missouri, there were no flights scheduled Sunday by American Airlines, which serves the small airport.
“Due to deteriorating conditions, American Airlines does not have any commercial flights scheduled to land or take off from Columbia Regional Airport on Sunday, Jan. 5,” the airport said in a statement on its website Sunday morning.
As blizzard conditions began in Topeka, Kansas, on Sunday, strong winds caused snow gusts throughout the area, as seen in video shared by the National Weather Service office in Topeka on Sunday morning.
“More of this can be expected through the day with drifting snow making travel nearly impossible. Stay home and stay safe,” the weather service in Topeka said on X.
The National Weather Service in St. Louis shared NOAA satellite imagery Sunday morning showing green splotches of lightning flashes.
“That means… we are getting thundersnow/thundersleet! This just underscores that snow/sleet rates are pretty heavy - avoid travel if at all possible!” the weather service posted on X.
Potentially historic January snowfall totals
Those with a Monday commute in places like Washington, DC, and Philadelphia might run into hazardous driving conditions as the storm is predicted to lay down several inches of snow. All District of Columbia Public Schools will be closed Monday due to weather conditions, the district said in a post on X Sunday.
The highest snow totals will pile up in the coldest areas, likely in parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Totals will be lower in areas where warmer air generates sleet and ice instead of snow.
This storm will be capable of unleashing more than a foot of snow and enough ice to knock out power just as the coldest temperatures of the season arrive in its wake. The storm’s forecast has also put several major cities on alert for potentially historic January snowfall totals.
St. Louis has seen only four days when more than a foot of snow fell in a day, a feat which could happen Sunday.
Laura Barczewski with CNN affiliate KSDK in St. Louis said the area has reportedly seen “hamster-sized snowflakes” as of Sunday afternoon.
Snow totals could range from an inch to more than a foot in parts of Missouri, depending on the storm’s track. This variable forecast extends to neighboring states as well, where some regions may see snowfall approaching record-breaking levels for January.
Kansas City and Indianapolis are among the metropolitan areas bracing for exceptional snow accumulations.
Kansas City could surpass its January record of 7.2 inches, set in 2011, while Indianapolis is also in the storm’s crosshairs, with forecasts suggesting the possibility of surpassing its January record of 11.4 inches, set in 2014.
Thunderstorms in the South
Those in the South can expect rain and some embedded thunderstorms as a result of this massive winter storm. A level 3 of 5 threat of severe thunderstorms is in place Sunday for parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
Damaging wind gusts and hail are the most likely threats from any severe thunderstorm but tornadoes are also possible.
The National Weather Service in Little Rock, Arkansas, confirmed in a Facebook post Sunday afternoon a tornado had been recorded near Avery in Lincoln County around 3.05 p.m. ET.
Another tornado was recorded around five hours later in Mississippi, eight miles east of Brandon, near Pelahatchie, the Weather Service said.
A tornado outbreak, including multiple rated EF3s, rocked parts of the South in late December.
The massive storm will finally exit the East Coast late Monday and fully diminish in impact overnight. But Tuesday, temperature drops of as much as 30 degrees below normal for the eastern two-thirds of the US will lock in whatever snow and ice fall from the storm.

Follow:
Mother Nature is getting a jumpstart on a resolution to revive winter in the United States after a recent warm spell and last year’s warmest winter on record.
Multiple bursts of increasingly brutal, cold Arctic air will overspread the eastern two-thirds of the country over the next few days, dropping temperatures to dangerous lows by next week.
Temperatures are shaping up to be the coldest of the winter so far and will be frigid even for what’s already typically the coldest time of the year. The cold will be pervasive – more than 70% of the country’s population will experience freezing temperatures over the next week – and stick around well into the month, increasing chances for snow.
The first push of cold air arrived Wednesday for the north-central US and will spread south and east for the remainder of the week and through the weekend. The West will largely miss out on any considerable cold, as has been the trend since at least the fall.
Chicago’s high temperature will be stuck in the low 20s by Friday, which is about 10 degrees colder than normal for early January. High temperatures could hover near the freezing mark in Kansas City, Missouri, St. Louis and Cincinnati.
Low temperatures early Saturday will be downright frigid for millions. Single digit lows will reach Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois while lows could dip to as much as 25 degrees below zero in northern North Dakota.
Breezy conditions for some in the eastern half of the US will make it feel even colder than what the thermometer reads. Dressing for how the air actually feels in the winter – known as wind chill – is critical to prevent frostbite and hypothermia.
People as far southeast as Atlanta and along the Interstate-95 corridor from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Boston will need to prepare for it to feel like the teens on Saturday morning.
Temperatures will be 5 to 20 degrees colder than normal for much of the central and eastern US this weekend, including the Gulf Coast states.
A high in the low 70s is typical for Orlando, Florida, at the beginning of the year but the city may struggle to reach 60 on Saturday.
Next week will be even colder
This first batch of cold air through the weekend is just an appetizer. A more brutal blast of bone-chilling air – the coldest of the season – along with dangerous wind chills will push into the central US on Monday and overspread the eastern two-thirds of the country by Tuesday.
Temperatures next week could plummet anywhere from 10 to more than 30 degrees below normal. Frigid wind chills will make the cold dangerous for anyone without access to heat or shelter, especially overnight.
Some of the most significant below average temperatures will occur from the central US to the Southeast. Overnight lows could dip below freezing along the Gulf Coast at times next week. New Orleans doesn’t frequently hit or fall below the freezing mark, but it could reach that threshold next week for the first time since last January.
The abnormal cold could also dip far enough south to wreak havoc on Florida’s highly sensitive citrus crops and cause iguanas to plummet from trees.
The cold is likely to stick around through the second weekend of January. This could leave the atmosphere primed to deliver snow and ice – potentially in places that don’t typically receive it.
Cold doesn’t always mean snow and ice is a guarantee, but a disruptive storm with both  is on the way this weekend and early next week. The storm’s exact track, impacts and timing will come into focus by the end of the week, but anyone from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic should prepare for winter weather.

Climate progress screeched to a halt this year. One country had its foot on the brake.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/climate/climate-negotiations-obstruction-saudi-arabia/index.html,"Climate progress screeched to a halt this year. One country had its foot on the brake.
In a year in which global efforts to tackle some of the planet’s most pressing crises — from climate change to plastic pollution — have ended in failure or bitter disappointment, there is one country whose name comes up again and again: Saudi Arabia.
For years, the oil-rich kingdom has been accused of using its vast resources and savvy negotiating tactics to push against and delay climate progress, but multiple experts say this year it has been bolder than ever.
Saudi Arabia’s interference has been “blatant and in your face,” said Harjeet Singh, a climate advocate and founding director of Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “They’re just blocking everything.”
Over the past few months, United Nations-backed talks on climate change, the biodiversity crisis, plastic pollution and desertification — the last of which was held in the Saudi capital Riyadh — all collapsed or resulted in agreements criticized as vastly insufficient.
This pattern of failure is not due to Saudi Arabia alone, experts say, but the country has been among those pushing hardest against ambitious action. “They’re the most brazen, the most outspoken,” said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at E3G, a climate think tank.
Saudi Arabia’s increased boldness may be due to a number of factors experts say, including the imminent arrival of climate-denier Donald Trump in the US White House.
But, it could also be a response to a growing global consensus around the need to stop burning fossil fuels. “They’re emboldened because they are now seeing writing on the wall,” Singh said.
A kingdom built on oil
Modern Saudi Arabia was built on fossil fuels. The discovery of oil reserves in the late 1930s took it from a nomadic, desert country to a prosperous kingdom within a handful of decades.
Oil is so fundamental to Saudi Arabia’s identity, it applied for some of its infrastructure including a pipeline and refinery to receive UNESCO World Heritage status.
Today, it boasts the world’s second largest oil reserves. Saudi government revenues depend on fossil fuels to the tune of around 70% — a reliance experts say helps explain its approach to climate action.
The country has “been obstructionist” since the beginning of the UN’s climate process three decades ago, Meyer told CNN. Not only has it consistently cast doubt on and undermined the scientific consensus on climate change — that it is caused by fossil fuel pollution — it also managed to bake in its own influence, he said.
In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia pushed for global climate decisions to be made on a consensus basis, rather than majority vote, meaning a handful of countries could block decisions, Meyer said. “They gamed the system at the very beginning.”
This consensus approach helped create “a world where the rules were set by the big and powerful,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama’s special representative for climate change.
While Monterrey Gómez did not single out any countries, he said the reliance on consensus “has turned into a weapon against the most vulnerable,” used by wealthy nations to block progress.
The system also helps explain why, for nearly three decades, fossil fuels were not explicitly named in global climate agreements.
This changed last year at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, when nearly 200 countries, Saudi Arabia among them, agreed to an unprecedented call for the world to transition away from fossil fuels.
But almost immediately after the agreement was struck, Saudi Arabia tried to walk it back. Saudi officials were saying “it’s voluntary, nothing to see here, just move along,” Meyer said. “Clearly they are on a warpath to prevent anything from building on that decision.
At the COP29 talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, last month, Saudi negotiators explicitly rejected any mention of fossil fuels in the final agreement. They got their way: The summit ended with a $300 billion finance deal for developing countries, heavily criticized as insufficient, and no recommitment to move away from oil, coal and gas.
“What we saw in Baku was very brazen,” Meyer said. Saudi Arabia acted like a “climate wrecking ball.”
Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry did not respond to CNN’s questions for this story. But speaking with CNN’s Becky Anderson earlier this month, the country’s climate envoy Adel al-Jubeir urged critics to “look at our actions,” referring to domestic initiatives, including recycling and tree planting.
“We have adopted a pragmatic, practical, problem-solving approach — non-emotional, non-political,” he said. “We are not about grandstanding, we are about tackling this challenge.”
But it’s not just the climate negotiations where experts have criticized Saudi’s role.
“What we’re seeing (Saudi Arabia) do in the climate space is entirely mirrored in the plastic space,” said David Azoulay, director of environmental health at the non-profit Center for International Environmental Law, or CIEL.
At the failed global plastic treaty talks in Busan, South Korea, which ended this month, Saudi Arabia was among those rejecting any limits on the production of plastic — almost all of which is made from fossil fuels.
Plastics are increasingly seen as a backup plan as demand for fossil fuel energy slowly recedes, Azoulay added. “We’ve seen the whole fossil fuel industry, not just the Saudis, reorient their businesses towards plastic and petrochemicals in general.”
A global problem
Saudi Arabia is far from alone, said said Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy program at CIEL. “It’s all too easy to just say, ‘oh, one single country is holding the world hostage on climate,’” she told CNN, but the picture is more complicated.
For decades, wealthy countries with fossil fuel interests — including the United States —have “hidden behind (Saudi Arabia), really benefiting from the tactics that they’ve masterfully used to dilute and delay progress” on climate and environmental issues, Reisch said.
These other countries may even shoulder more of the moral blame for the slow pace of action, said Singh, the climate advocate. Unlike Saudi Arabia, whose economy hinges on fossil fuels, “it is far easier for those (other) countries to move away from fossil fuel extraction.”
A senior US official said claims the country has hidden behind Saudi actions were “completely inaccurate.” It was “openly at odds with Saudi Arabia” on plans for keeping global warming below internationally agreed limits, the official told CNN, “and clearly disappointed when consensus outcomes fell short.”
Saudi Arabia does have its own plan to reduce planet-warming pollution. It has a strategy to diversify its economy called Vision 2030 and has committed to net-zero emissions by 2060 — although its targets are rated as “critically insufficient” by the research group Climate Action Tracker.
“They know which direction of travel we’re going in,” E3G’s Meyer said, referring to the global ambition to cut the use of coal, gas and oil. “They’re just trying to slow down the rate.”
But for developing countries, still building their own economies in the face of increasingly extreme natural disasters, delaying climate action is akin to a death knell, said Panama’s Monterrey Gómez, who attended COP29 at the same time as deadly floods and landslides hit his home country.
His hope lies in national and local efforts to speed up adaptation and resilience, “because what’s coming our way is so catastrophic,” he said.
Saudi Arabia itself is very vulnerable to the climate crisis. The arid nation is susceptible to both floods and drought as well as searing heat waves. Last summer more than 1,300 people died on the Hajj pilgrimage as temperatures soared to 125 degrees Fahrenheit — and it’s set to only get worse.
“People are pointing at each other, saying your end of the lifeboat is sinking,” Meyer said, “and they don’t accept that we’re all in the same boat and we’re going down together.”"

A series of atmospheric river-fueled storms are pounding the West with powerful winds, drenching rain, heavy mountain snow and churning up massive waves and dangerous seas just off the coast.
The seemingly never-ending series of storms began over the weekend but turned deadly early this week in California.
A man died Monday morning after being trapped under debris in Sunset State Beach in central California, The Associated Press reported. A large wave likely pinned him there, according to the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office.
Another man was likely swept out to sea just a few miles south at Marina State Beach early Monday afternoon, authorities said. The US Coast Guard and California Highway Patrol were deployed to search for the man by air and sea but could not find him, according to the Marina Police.
Waves were around 10 feet high in the Monterey Bay area – where both incidents took place – from late Monday morning into the early afternoon, according to data from NOAA. Waves as high as 25 feet were reported elsewhere near the coast of northern and central California Monday.
The storm expanded its threats Tuesday as heavy rain deluged the northern half of California, including San Francisco. Rainfall rates could reach 3 to 4 inches per hour during the heaviest rain Tuesday, mainly in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the National Weather Service warned.
Torrential rain could create flash flooding and debris flows, especially across burn scars in the area. Burn scars are often a combination of burned plant life, debris and an altered layer of soil, which make them prone to flooding.
Heavy mountain snow will fall through Tuesday in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada and parts of the Cascades where winter weather alerts are in place. Widespread snowfall up to a foot is possible with isolated totals potentially exceeding a foot.
Along with snow, widespread wind gusts of 70 mph with isolated gusts across ridges potentially reaching 90 mph could cause blowing snow and reduced visibility to any travelers.
This storm is also whipping up winds elsewhere along the West Coast, where high wind alerts are in effect. Widespread wind gusts to 60 mph could cause power outages on land and are already amplifying dangerous waves off the coast. Waves up to 35 feet could cause coastal erosion and damage to coastal communities this week.
“Life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions and significant shoreline erosion can be expected,” the NWS warned. “Large waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches.”
Pier crumbles into the sea
A dramatic collapse of a section of the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf on Monday afternoon underscored growing challenges posed by climate change and the urgent need for public safety measures.
Around 12:45 p.m. Monday, the end of the wharf, about a 200-foot portion, collapsed into the Pacific Ocean, along with three workers, a closed-down restaurant and a closed public bathroom facility, Santa Cruz city officials said Tuesday.
That portion of the wharf and the city’s iconic Dolphin Restaurant had been closed to the public for construction since last December, following significant damage caused by previous storms.
As powerful waves fueled by high tides and windy conditions beat against the wharf Monday, the active construction site collapsed into the ocean. The rest of the wharf is intact, officials said.
Two of the workers who fell into the water were rescued by a lifeguard unit, and the other person self-rescued, assistant city manager Michelle Templeton said Tuesday.
The city was expecting the large ocean swell this week and had deployed eight additional lifeguards, some of whom were patrolling the water on watercraft when the incident occurred, according to Ryan Reber, chief of operations for the city’s fire division.
“This isn’t what we thought was going to happen, for sure, but we were prepared and we were in the water already, so it was a quick deployment and a quick rescue for us. We had this on our radar,” Reber said.
The collapse, attributed to the relentless force of the ocean, has left significant debris, including pilings and sections of the deck, posing serious hazards to navigation and public safety. The incident was “another testament to the power of our changing climate,” City Manager Matt Huffaker said.
Officials are asking the public not to attempt to retrieve any debris remaining in the water.
Back-to-back storms last December caused the initial closure of the wharf and prompted a $4 million dollar restoration project, which is ongoing, city officials said.
“As many people know and see on a daily basis here in Santa Cruz, climate change has been bringing on more intense storms, coupled with sea level rise, and with that, the city continues to face growing challenges that threaten Santa Cruz’s infrastructure and coastline,” Templeton said.
Santa Cruz Mayor Fred Keeley said the city will need to address those broader challenges going forward.
“I don’t think we’re by ourselves. I think this is what coastal communities around the world are probably dealing with in that manifestation of climate change,” Keeley said Tuesday.
As the city braces for more severe weather, officials urged the public to heed high surf warnings and steer clear of the beaches. “Our coastline is wild. It’s unpredictable,” Huffaker warned, urging vigilance during the holiday season.
More storminess ahead for Christmas and beyond
The storm slamming the West Coast will move east Wednesday and could bring up to a foot of snowfall across the Rockies, just in time for Christmas Day and the start of Hanukkah.
It’ll eventually move into the Southern Plains Thursday, where its threat will shift once again, this time to severe thunderstorms. The strongest threat of severe storms could encompass eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana Thursday afternoon, where a level 2 of 5 risk of severe storms is in place, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
The West Coast will only have a short break from storms before another atmospheric river-fueled storm begins to lash the coast by Wednesday evening, bringing a prolonged round of coastal and lower-elevation rainfall and higher-elevation snowfall through the weekend.
Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches are possible through late in the week, which could lead to additional flooding and rising river levels. Feet of snowfall could bury the area’s higher elevations and wind gusts up to 65 mph could bring life-threatening conditions to travelers, the NWS warned.

This greenhouse keeps crops cool. It could prove valuable as our planet bakes,https://www.cnn.com/climate/secondsky-iyris-heat-blocking-greenhouse-spc/index.html,"This greenhouse keeps crops cool. It could prove valuable as our planet bakes
Follow:
In a world where the climate is increasingly hot and volatile, farmers are having trouble keeping their crops cool. A startup founded in the desert of Saudi Arabia thinks it might have a solution.
Its technology reduces temperatures inside greenhouses by up to 7 degrees Celsius, without losing any light, by using nanotechnology embedded within plastic polymer sheeting to cut out near infrared solar radiation. By reducing heat inside greenhouses, the company claims crops can be grown with as much as 30% less water, and less energy required in a greenhouse with mechanical cooling.
Called SecondSky, it was developed by Derya Baran, an associate professor in material science and engineering at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).
The prize-winning design was quickly commercialized and now boasts buyers in 15 countries, via Iyris (formerly RedSea), a company spun out of the research efforts at KAUST.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were among the earliest countries to adopt the technology, Iyris executive chairperson John Keppler told CNN – hot, dry, resource-scarce countries looking to curb their reliance on imports for fresh produce.
But since then, farmers in parts of the US, Latin America, Mexico, Europe, South Africa and Morocco have started installing SecondSky coverings. These are, said Keppler, countries that historically have benefited from a robust set of environmental attributes that are changing rapidly: “It’s not even just future-proofing, it’s current-proofing; it’s writing an insurance policy,” he said.
Following the hottest summer globally on record, this year is all but certain to be the warmest in history, per Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with many extreme heat events felt across the world – events becoming more possible due to human-induced climate change.
These conditions put a massive strain on agriculture. Heat peaks can desiccate crops, killing them outright if unmitigated, or stressing crops, leaving them more vulnerable to pests and disease. Avoiding a decrease in crop yield typically requires increased energy inputs – more water, more cooling, more fertilizer – resources that may be depleted or simply unavailable.
“The mission of this company is to enable sustainable agriculture, and we’re making some very important progress against a really difficult challenge,” said Keppler. “The sooner we can deliver drop-in solutions for regular-way agriculture, the better off we’re going to be.”
Iyris has integrated SecondSky into flexible polyfilm, which is used for polytunnels, plastic sheets for rigid greenhouses, and netting.
Polyfilm is typically replaced every three to five years, said Keppler, and can be easily swapped in. Iyris says that unlike some traditional interventions to block heat, such as applying white chalk to plastic film, its additive does not negatively impact the plastic’s lifespan.
The company has partnered with plastics producers such as SABIC in Saudi Arabia, Hyma Plastic in Egypt and Armando Alvarez in Spain to manufacture and distribute coverings containing its heat-blocking additive, and it says to date 4.5 million square meters of its materials have been sold.
Vincent Martin, director of the Office of Innovation at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, told CNN via email that “a number of agritech start-ups have emerged in recent years to address regional food production challenges, especially investing in protected agriculture.”
These companies are “adapting to the realities of extreme heat through innovations in resilient crops, controlled environments, smart irrigation, and renewable energy. However, scaling these solutions to reach smallholder farmers and addressing cost barriers are critical for broader adaptation.
“Continued investment in research, infrastructure, policies and farmer education will be key,” he added.
Homegrown solutions for growing at home
While Iyris has its sights on the global market (it received $16 million in series A fundraising earlier this year) SecondSky is having a hand in redefining what’s possible in agriculture closer to home.
In Saudi Arabia, the National Food Production Initiative, a partnership including Iyris and regenerative tourism developer Red Sea Global, created a 0.75-hectare farm on unproductive land in Bada, in the northwest of the country, a subtropical desert where summer temperatures average just below 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
The project, announced in October, is integrating multiple homegrown agritech solutions, including SecondSky, to grow crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and herbs, supplied to Red Sea Global resorts.
“(We’re) proving these incredibly innovative outcomes in the harshest environment in the world,” said Keppler.
The farm in Bada has prompted a local cooperative to explore replicating the model, he added.
Making use of unproductive land, and preventing land from becoming unproductive, will come into increased focus as the century progresses. Desertification is a pressing issue and was the focus of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification’s COP16 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in December, as leaders seek to curtail an accelerating problem. Worldwide, at least 100 million hectares of healthy land are lost each year, per the United Nations – the equivalent of four soccer fields of healthy land is becoming degraded every second.
In Saudi Arabia, for example, where less than 1% of land is considered arable, water requirements for crop cultivation can be three times the global average, and the kingdom’s groundwater aquifers, a major source of water for agriculture, are decreasing, having been extracted at higher rates than they are being replenished.
“Agritech and sustainable agricultural practices can play a crucial role in mitigating or reversing desertification,” said Martin, through things like sustainable land management, water management innovations, development of resilient crops, and soil restoration techniques.
He added that switching, to some extent, from open field production to protected agriculture could save a significant amount of water, and that greenhouses in hot climates are “particularly suited to offset the effects of climate change,” because growers can control factors such as temperature and humidity.
“Greenhouses can yield up to five times the land productivity and seven times the water productivity of open cultivated lands, ” added Martin.
Leaving more natural resources untouched can only be a good thing; likewise lowering the requirements to make marginal land arable.
“What you need to do is be able to create an environment where you’re reducing the environmental stressors that enable that land to be utilized, said Keppler. “And that’s what products like SecondSky do.”
With sales increasing, according to Iyris, and plans to integrate SecondSky into a wider range of products in 2025, the company hopes that beating the heat inside greenhouses around the world can help us beat the heat outside them too."
Biden just unveiled America’s ambitious new climate goal. Trump will assuredly undo it,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/climate/biden-new-climate-goal-paris-trump-climate/index.html,"Biden just unveiled America’s ambitious new climate goal. Trump will assuredly undo it
Follow:
The Biden administration just announced an aggressive target for the US to cut its planet-warming pollution over the next decade – a goal that will all but assuredly be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump in his first days in office.
The ambitious new target aims to cut US climate pollution to 61-66% below 2005 levels by 2035, which would have been a challenge even if voters had elected another Democratic president. Trump has said he intends to drill for more oil and gas, shred federal climate regulations and seek to overturn Biden’s clean energy law.
A new target is required every five years by the international Paris Agreement, which Trump has promised to once again pull the US out of. Biden made climate one of the centerpieces of his presidency – by announcing the US target well before its February 2025 due date, the administration is signaling the path America should strive to take against the headwinds of an anti-climate Trump administration.
“We’re confident in America’s ability to rally around this new climate goal, because while the US federal government under President Trump may put climate action on the back burner, the work to contain climate change is going to continue in the United States with commitment and passion and belief,” White House senior adviser John Podesta told reporters. “That’s not wishful thinking. It’s happened before.”
Some independent analysis is not as optimistic. If Trump successfully repeals Biden’s climate law and unravels key regulations, the US will only be able to cut pollution 24-40% below 2005 levels in the next decade, according to the nonpartisan climate think tank Rhodium Group.
“For this new, very ambitious target for 2035, we’re not on track – and we are likely to be further off track under a Trump administration,” said Kate Larsen, who leads Rhodium’s international energy and climate research.
Larsen noted the US cut its emissions under Trump’s first term and said it’s likely to do so again. But the pace of cutting planet-warming pollution is really what matters, she noted.
“Every year we delay taking sufficiently ambitious action means that in subsequent years we’ll need to go even further, faster,” Larsen said. “A lack of new policy, the inability to defend the policy that we have in place today, will undermine those efforts.”
Senior Biden administration officials said their ambitious goal considered the fact that the Trump administration is likely to sprint the other way and leans heavily on states and businesses stepping up.
Climate modelers said there is wild uncertainty on what the next four years will bring for US climate policy. It is unclear whether Trump will be able to convince congressional Republicans to kill Biden’s clean energy law, which is pouring billions of dollars and thousands of jobs into GOP districts. Renewables like wind and solar are far cheaper than fossil fuels, and the number of electric vehicles on the roads is growing.
“We need to be moving as fast as possible on climate. But I think that some amount of progress is baked in,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at think tank Energy Innovation.
Biden oversaw a historic climate and clean energy bill and directing his federal agencies to release ambitious regulations cutting greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.
In a statement, Biden said he was “proud” of overseeing “the boldest climate agenda in American history.”
But the US is on track to fall short of the goal Biden announced at the beginning of his presidency – cutting 45% of its climate pollution by the end of this decade, rather than the 50-52% laid out in the target.
The US isn’t the only climate laggard. Scientists say that most countries are not getting off fossil fuels fast enough to stop dramatic warming of the planet. Data shows 2024 will be the hottest year on record and the first calendar year to exceed the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Experts said it’s key for the Biden administration to set a strong goal – even if Trump claws it back – as other high-polluting countries, including China, prepare their own climate targets.
“I think it’s a really important signal,” Larsen said. “The US is demonstrating that we are there as partners with the rest of the world, setting that that long term vision – even if we for the next four years won’t have a full federal government organized around achieving that.”
Climate experts are now looking to individual states to build clean energy and implement climate action. While California and New York are signaling ambitious climate actions of their own, clean energy is also booming in red states. Texas is generating by far the most electricity from wind power and is fast deploying battery energy storage. Electric vehicle manufacturing is booming in southern states like Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina – spurred in large part by Biden’s law.
“We have this small but not insignificant contingent of House Republicans who are openly talking about needing to protect [the law],” Orvis said. “It’s because it’s delivering jobs and savings for households.”"

Topsy turvy temperatures are on the way for millions of Americans in the final days of 2024 as winter struggles to take hold.
Periodic blasts of bitterly cold Arctic air have plunged into the northern and eastern US this December in stark contrast to the warmest fall on record it followed.
But this seasonally appropriate air has been interrupted by periods of fall-like warmth – a temperature rollercoaster that will continue at least until 2025 arrives.
A new batch of Arctic air will reach the north-central US on Thursday at the same time a quick-moving storm brings some snow to the area. This cold air will quickly expand south and east Friday and encompass the entire eastern half of the country by Saturday.
Friday will likely be the coldest day of the week in Minneapolis. The city climbed to 40 degrees on Monday but will fail to get warmer than the teens on Friday – a full 10 degrees below normal. Single-digit low temperatures are likely Friday night.
Chicago’s high temperature will likely be below freezing on Saturday afternoon after temperatures plummet into the teens Friday night.
The coldest air of the season will settle over the East Coast Saturday and Sunday – on the first weekend of astronomical winter. Meteorological winter, which is what is used to track temperature records, began December 1.
New York City has yet to have a sub-freezing high temperature this meteorological winter but that’s likely to change on Sunday, when the high temperature will struggle to reach the mid-20s after starting out in the teens – also a first for the season – early in the morning.
The East Coast will remain quite cold through early next week but a warmup for the central US will begin as soon as Sunday.
Minneapolis, after its foray into the teens and single digits, will be back closer to 30 degrees by Sunday afternoon and potentially reach above freezing by Monday – about 10 degrees above normal.
Wednesday – Christmas Day and the beginning of Hanukkah – will mark the start of an extreme trend for the entire Lower 48.
“All forecast guidance favors an unseasonably warm final week of 2024,” the Weather Prediction Center said Tuesday.
The latest forecast is the most unusually warm issued by the center on such a large scale in more than 15 years, according to climatologist Brian Brettschneider.
Some forecast models are hinting at the potential for temperatures to soar nearly 25 degrees above normal in the Midwest by late next week. It’ll feel like October in Chicago and Indianapolis if that remains the case.
The West has largely missed out on any cooler than normal conditions in December which is another trend that looks to carry into early 2025.
Temperatures could reach up to 10 degrees above normal elsewhere from coast to coast as New Year’s Eve approaches."

Follow:
Accurately predicting the weather is hard — really hard, but a new AI-powered forecast model just hit a milestone that has experts saying your forecast could soon get more accurate, and further out, too.
It takes a Herculean effort to keep pace with weather in an atmosphere constantly in flux. The task is so difficult and complex that a reliable forecast more than a couple of days in advance was unheard of just a few decades ago.
A five-day forecast in the early 1980s was only accurate about 65% of the time. But better weather observations, more robust computing power and innovations in the way weather around the globe is modeled by computers has improved forecasts by leaps and bounds. Today the same forecast hits the mark nine times out of 10.
Forecasts took another step forward this month, experts said, thanks to GenCast, a new artificial intelligence forecast model by Google’s DeepMind. Its forecasts through 15 days were significantly more accurate than one of the most well-respected traditional non-AI forecast models, according to a study published by DeepMind in the journal Nature.
“It’s an impressive result,” said Peter Dueben, a machine learning expert and head of Earth system modeling at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, home to the model bested by GenCast. “It’s a big step.”
GenCast isn’t ready for the public yet. It and other AI models still have a few key kinks to work out, particularly in forecasting the more frequent and severe weather of a warming world, before they change forecasting and save lives in the process.
Man vs. machine
The skill and usefulness of weather forecast models has always been closely tied to technology.
The majority of weather forecast models used today are based on a complex series of mathematical equations that model the physics of the atmosphere and use hundreds of millions of datapoints from real-time weather observations to paint a picture of how the weather will play out a day, a week or even a season from now.
This process of numerical weather prediction was first conceived in the early 1900s and needed to be done by hand, a method so slow that the weather had already happened long before calculations were finished.
Early computers improved forecasting in the 1950s and 1960s, but it wasn’t until 1974 that the first model able to pull in data from around the globe and generate a rudimentary forecast became operational.
Skip to the current day and supercomputers are performing a nearly unfathomable number of calculations daily to produce highly detailed weather forecasts many days into the future around the globe.
But current forecast models still have limitations. The most robust ones can only be run every few hours because of how long it takes to crunch the complex calculations. They also demand a lot of computing power and energy that make them costly.
And they have limitations when it comes to forecasting, too. The farther out in time they get from observations of the atmosphere, the more difficult it is to get a clear idea of what’s to come because the atmosphere never stops changing.
Most AI weather forecasting models like Google’s GenCast take a different approach. Rather than relying on observations plugged into physics-based equations, they predict how Earth’s atmosphere might behave in the future by analyzing verified past weather data to understand how the atmosphere behaved in similar situations. This helps improve accuracy over traditional models by eliminating errors from real-time weather data.
AI forecast models also run simulations a lot faster and use less computing power and energy than traditional models once they’re trained and ready to go. This means they can be run more frequently and model a wider range of possibilities, improving forecasts as they do.
Google’s game changer
AI weather modeling before Google’s GenCast has been limited to models that spit out a singular forecast without any indication of how likely it is to happen. It’s essentially a best guess that’s most useful for predicting common weather variables like temperature, precipitation and wind a handful of days in advance.
But GenCast runs dozens of simulations simultaneously.
“Once you have multiple possible futures it gives you a sense of both the range of what might happen and it also lets you calculate how likely some (futures) are rather than others,” according to Ilan Price, the lead author of the new study and a senior research scientist with DeepMind.
This type of modeling approach is highly regarded because it lends more confidence to weather forecasts for around five to 15 days in the future.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’s model is widely considered to be the gold standard. It was what Google wanted to beat with its first-of-its-kind AI version — and it did.
Researchers trained GenCast on 40 years of weather data up to 2018. They then used the trained model to predict more than 1,300 combinations of conditions like temperatures, precipitation and wind speeds, in 2019’s weather.
The AI model produced more accurate forecasts than the ECMWF’s traditional model for more than 97% of these variables within a 15-day timeframe, but showed particular skill within the first week of forecasts.
It showed anywhere from a 10 to 30% accuracy improvement on forecasts in the three-to-five-day range, depending on the exact combination of variables tested, according to Price. GenCast also had more accurate forecasts than the ECMWF’s model up to 15 days in the future, the study said.
The AI model could better capture some forms of extreme weather, including exceptionally high and low temperatures and extreme wind speeds. GenCast also needed less than 10 minutes to run on a supercomputer, compared to the hours necessary for traditional models.
The results mark an “inflection point” in AI weather modeling technology, Price said.
“AI-based weather forecasting is ready for prime time,” Price added. “It’s ready to start being incorporated alongside… traditional models in operation.”
GenCast is not in operation yet, but the DeepMind team plans to take another step toward it by releasing its present-day forecasts and an archive of its past forecasts, according to Price.
A big problem to solve
GenCast is a critical advancement in modeling, but like any other weather forecast model, it isn’t perfect.
AI models introduce a new potential issue since they predict the future based on what they’ve seen in past data.
“The machine learning model… doesn’t know anything about physics,” Dueben explained.
This can make it difficult for AI to conceive of future extremes that haven’t occurred in the recent past. Can an AI model trained on only 40 years of data accurately predict the types of extremes happening at a record pace in a changing climate, like a once-in-100 year or once-in-1,000 year torrential rainfall event?
“It turns out that actually these models are more robust to those extreme events than you would think,” Dueben said. The ECMWF has tested AI models against real-time weather for more than a year now and has seen improvements in their overall accuracy, even with extreme events, he explained.
But AI models can start inventing impossible-on-Earth physics the farther out in time they look, according to Dueben.
Other prediction issues remain, particularly with one of the most destructive weather phenomena: tropical cyclones.
Accurately predicting how strong a tropical cyclone like a hurricane or typhoon could become is an issue that plagues all models. It’s a crucial problem to solve as tropical systems get stronger and rapidly intensify more frequently in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
GenCast showed better skill than traditional models when predicting the tracks of tropical systems but struggled to accurately capture intensity, according to Price.
In part, that’s because some of the recent notable record-breaking systems weren’t included in the 40 years of data GenCast was trained on, Price noted.
It’s an issue Price is “quite confident” can be overcome in the future as the model trains on more data.
There are also models in development combining machine learning with real-world physics — known as hybrid models — that could be the solution to some of these problems.
Each step forward with this nascent technology adds another tool human weather forecasters can use to craft accurate forecasts people rely on for almost every aspect of their lives.
“You can be as skeptical as you want against machine learning forecasts in principle,” Dueben said. “These models will make a positive impact on our weather predictions; there’s no question there.”"
A controversial plan to refreeze the Arctic is seeing promising results. But scientists warn of big risks,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/climate/refreeze-arctic-real-ice/index.html,"A controversial plan to refreeze the Arctic is seeing promising results. But scientists warn of big risks
Deep in the Canadian Arctic, scientists and entrepreneurs brave sub-zero temperatures, whipping winds and snowstorms to drill holes through the sea ice to pump out the seawater below and freeze it on the surface.
The group from the UK start-up Real Ice is in Cambridge Bay, a tiny coastal village in Nunavut, to try to prove they can grow and restore Arctic sea ice.
Their ultimate plan is to thicken ice over more than 386,000 square miles of the Arctic — an area more than twice the size of California — with the aim of slowing down or even reversing summer ice loss and, in doing so, help to tackle the human-caused climate crisis.
It’s a bold plan, and one of many controversial geo-engineering proposals to save the planet’s vulnerable polar regions that range from installing a giant underwater “curtain” to protect ice sheets, to sprinkling tiny glass beads to reflect away sunlight.
Some Arctic scientists and experts have criticized Real Ice’s methods as unproven at scale, ecologically risky and a distraction from tackling the root cause of climate change: fossil fuels.
But the company says its project is inspired by natural processes and offers a last chance to protect a disappearing ecosystem as the world fails to act swiftly on climate change.
Arctic sea ice is shrinking as humans continue to heat up the world by burning fossil fuels. Since the mid-1980s, the amount of thick, multi-year ice has shrunk by 95%. The ice that remains is young and thin. Some scientists predict the Arctic could have an ice-free summer as early as the 2030s.
The loss of sea ice is a global problem. Its bright white surface reflects the sun’s energy back into space, cooling the planet. When it melts, the darker ocean exposed beneath is able to absorb more of the sun’s rays. It’s a doom loop — global warming melts the ice and melting ice supercharges global warming.
Real Ice’s plan for protecting this icy ocean landscape involves inserting electric-powered, submersible pumps under sea ice to pump seawater onto the surface. The water freezes as it pools across the ice like a huge puddle, creating an extra layer of ice.
The process also removes snow from the top of the ice, stripping it of an insulating layer and triggering extra growth on the underside of the sea ice, said Andrea Ceccolini, co-CEO of Real Ice.
The startup has been conducting field tests in the Arctic for almost two years. The first were in Alaska last year, mostly to check that the equipment worked and could stand up to the brutal cold.
The group started tests in Cambridge Bay in Canada in January this year. They covered around 44,000 square feet of ice and added an average of 20 inches of additional thickness between January and May compared to the control area, Ceccolini said.
A new round of tests in Cambridge Bay began in November and they have so far covered 430,000 square feet. In the first 10 days of the trial, the ice was already 4 inches thicker in the places they were testing, said Ceccolini.
They will return in the new year and again in May to measure how much ice has been created. Based on previous results, they expect between around 16 to 31 inches of ice gain, Ceccolini said.
“​​It is early days,” said Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge, which has been working with Real Ice on the trials. But early results have been encouraging, he told CNN. “I am optimistic, but we need more experiments and more data.”
The ultimate plan is to automate the process using underwater drones, each about 6.5 feet long and powered by green hydrogen. These will melt holes in the ice from below using heated drills.
Ceccolini estimates around 500,000 drones would be used at full scale, and would be deployed carefully to avoid animal migration paths or shipping lanes, he said.
If all goes to plan, he expects they can scale up within eight to 10 years.
It won’t be cheap. Real Ice estimates the cost to be between $5 billion and $6 billion a year to thicken ice over 386,000 square miles, an area it believes is large enough “to be effective in slowing down and even reversing the losses of summer sea ice in the Arctic,” Ceccolini said.
Real Ice is mostly self funded with some money from investors. Eventually, they see a global fund or governments stepping in to pay. They also envision selling “cooling credits,” where polluters pay toward ice refreezing in order to “offset” their own pollution.
It’s a compelling vision but many scientists remain doubtful it could work at scale.
‘Extremely questionable’
The science is sound, said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, “ice will be made measurably thicker and brighter in local areas surrounding the pumps.” But a big question, she told CNN, is whether enough sea ice can be grown over a long enough period to make any difference to the climate crisis. “I have serious doubts,” she said.
The scalability of Real Ice’s solution is “extremely questionable,” said Liz Bagshaw, associate professor in polar environmental change at the University of Bristol. She also warned of potentially wide-ranging ecological impacts on a vulnerable region. “Such interventions are morally dubious at best, and at worst, ethically irresponsible,” she told CNN.
Dozens of scientists expressed concerns in a recent report about polar geoengineering projects, including ice thickening. They warned of “the possibility of grave unforeseen consequences,” including the environmental impact of “an unprecedented level of human presence” in the Arctic.
Ceccolnini does not deny the project could cause changes to the marine environment – for example, they are looking at algae growth that can be affected by ice thickness – but believes overall impacts will be limited.
The project’s future depends on whether they can prove ice thickening is effective and that it creates no significant side effects, he said.
“Everything we do has an impact,” Ceccolini said. “The problem is there is a much more dramatic impact in just letting things go on like this.”"

A wide-reaching storm boosted by an atmospheric river was drenching the entire East Coast Wednesday with heavy rain and strong winds.
The storm’s worst sloppy mess of heavy rain and strong winds made for treacherous travel and a miserable day in the Northeast. Winds gusting 50 to 60 mph in the afternoon and evening threatened to knock out power across the region, including in New York City and Boston.
“Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines. Widespread power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles,” such as buses and trucks the National Weather Service office in Boston warned.
More than 80,000 homes and businesses on the East Coast have lost power as of Wednesday night – including about 44,000 in Maine and 13,000 in Massachusetts, according to poweroutage.us.
The atmospheric river feeding the system is tapping into the warm tropical ocean off the coast of the Southeast to create moisture levels rarely seen in the Northeast outside of tropical systems, allowing for faster rainfall rates and the potential for flash flooding.
Experts are saying this will be the most moisture-rich system in the Northeast since last December when widespread flooding killed several people and caused significant damage to roads in Maine.
This will be the first significant rain event for much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast since August, so while the atmosphere is loaded with flooding rainfall potential, the ongoing drought conditions in the region, including extreme drought conditions in New Jersey, should limit widespread flooding.
“The main concerns will be urban and poor drainage flooding and ponding on roadways,” forecasters with the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, said.
The drought stems from a record warm and dry fall that has stretched into winter. Philadelphia hasn’t recorded more than 1 inch of rain in a day since August 6. The last time New York’s Central Park had a 2-inch soaker was August 18.
Still, the storm could dump a lot of rain, and quickly. A level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rain is posted from Long Island, New York, north through Maine with more than 1.5 inches of rain expected for much of the East Coast and more isolated pockets of 2 to 4 inches possible.
Rapid snow melt in areas in interior New England could add to the localized flash flooding concerns, especially near smaller creeks and low-lying areas.
“The rivers across New England can thankfully take a decent surge of moisture after a very dry fall, so the prospects of significant flooding are lower than normal at this point,” adds the Weather Prediction Center.
Rainfall totals may not end up quite as high for areas outside of the Northeast but parts of the mid-Atlantic could encounter a few severe thunderstorms Wednesday.
A level 2 of 5 risk of severe storms is in place from eastern North Carolina north along the immediate coast to southern New England, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Damaging wind gusts are the primary threat from any thunderstorm, but a few tornadoes are also possible, particulary in eastern North Carolina.
Another rush of Arctic air will arrive behind this storm, dropping temperatures back below normal.
Much of the Northern Plains and Midwest will wake up to below zero wind chills by Wednesday morning. This will once again trigger the lake effect snow in the Great Lakes by the middle of the week, and 1 to 2 feet of snow is possible off lakes Erie and Ontario by the end of the week.

The world has been warming faster than expected. Scientists now think they know why,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/climate/global-warming-clouds/index.html,"The world has been warming faster than expected. Scientists now think they know why

Last year was the hottest on record, oceans boiled, glaciers melted at alarming rates, and it left scientists scrambling to understand exactly why.
They know the extraordinary heat was fueled by a number of factors, predominantly planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels and the natural climate pattern El Niño. B﻿ut those alone did not explain the unusually rapid temperature rise.
Now a new study ﻿published Thursday in the journal Science says it has identified the missing part of the puzzle: clouds.
To be more specific, the rapid surge in warming was supercharged by a dearth of low-lying clouds over the oceans, according to the research — findings which may have alarming implications for future warming.
In simple terms, fewer bright, low clouds mean the planet “has darkened,” allowing it to absorb more sunlight, said Helge Goessling, a report author and climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.
This phenomenon is called “albedo” and refers to the ability of surfaces to reflect the sun’s energy back into space.
The Earth’s albedo has been declining since the 1970s, according to the report, due in part to the melting of light-colored snow and sea ice, exposing darker land and water which absorb more of the sun’s energy, heating up the planet.
Low clouds also feed into this effect as they reflect away sunlight.
The scientists scoured NASA satellite data, weather data and climate models and found the decline in low clouds reduced the planet’s albedo to record lows last year. Areas including parts of the North Atlantic Ocean experienced a particularly significant fall, the study found.
Last year fits into a decade-long decline of low cloud cover, Goessling told CNN.
What the study can’t yet explain for certain is why this is happening. “This is such a complex beast and so hard to disentangle,” Goessling said.
He believes it is likely the result of a combination of factors. The first is a reduction in shipping pollution due to regulations aimed at reducing the industry’s harmful sulfur emissions. While this has been a win for human health, this type of pollution was also helping cool the planet by brightening clouds.
Natural climate variabilities, including changing ocean patterns, may also have contributed. But Goessling points to a third, more alarming factor: global warming itself.
Low-level clouds tend to thrive in a cool and moist lower atmosphere. As the planet’s surface heats up, this can cause them to thin or dissipate entirely, setting up a complicated feedback loop where low clouds are disappearing because of global warming, and their disappearance then drives further warming.
If this is happening, future warming projections may be underestimated and “we should expect rather intense warming in the future,” Goessling said.
Mark Zalinka, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who was not involved in the study, said “the fact that clouds play a key role in the story makes sense, as they essentially act as Earth’s sunscreen.”
Small changes in cloud cover can “drastically change Earth’s albedo,” he told CNN.
Tapio Schneider, a climate scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said the worrying implication of the research is if global warming is responsible for a substantial amount of cloud cover change, “we may see stronger global warming than previously predicted.”
Clouds may seem simple, even mundane, but they are endlessly complex and scientists remain far from unraveling how they behave. They are “one of the biggest headaches” in climate science, Goessling said.
But figuring out how clouds will respond to global warming is key, Zalkina said. “It literally determines how much future warming is in store.”"

Follow:
A quick-hitting but potent winter storm is delivering intense bursts of snow and strong winds from the Midwest to the Northeast, knocking out power and creating dangerous travel conditions for commuters.
The storm slid east and expanded its wintry conditions over more of the Great Lakes, Midwest and parts of the interior Northeast Wednesday afternoon. Snow squalls slammed parts of northern Ohio and an area south of Chicago Wednesday night into early Thursday, with the threat of more snow squalls spreading to the interior Northeast beginning Thursday morning.
Snow squalls are intense but brief bursts of heavy snow and strong winds that can create blinding, whiteout conditions seemingly out of nowhere, and are incredibly dangerous for drivers.
“There is no safe place on a highway during a snow squall,” the Weather Prediction Center warned. “Dangerous travel conditions are likely, including whiteout visibility and rapidly worsening road conditions.” A snow squall was responsible for a massive pileup in Pennsylvania in 2022 that involved 80 vehicles and killed six people.
A few snow squalls also blew across parts of North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin Wednesday morning and early afternoon.
And as the next round of snowfall is ongoing across the Great Lakes and interior Northeast, a reinforcing shot of cold air is spreading across the East, bringing drastic temperature drops ranging from 10-25 degrees below average.
As the cold air continues to spread into the East, high temperatures largely in the 40s and 50s on Wednesday will plunge to the 20s and 30s for Thursday.
Another hallmark from this storm will be strong winds capable of knocking out power and damaging trees, particularly from the Appalachians and mid-Atlantic to the New England coast. Wind gusts of 30 to 50 mph will roar over the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic Thursday including in Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York City.
Snow from this storm will impact a much larger area than the storms of the past few weeks, but should still dodge the cities along the Northeast’s I-95 corridor. The most snow will once again pile up in elevated areas and downwind of the Great Lakes, where 5 feet of snow fell over the holiday weekend. Snow and lake-effect from the storm could dump another 1 to 2 feet on areas that are still digging out.
Lighter snow up to an inch or two is possible in some of the Northeast’s lower elevations.
A few snowflakes could mix with rain at times along the Interstate-95 corridor. Any accumulating snow is unlikely close to the coast but wet roads and chilly air could lead to slick spots and tricky travel.

After the the Northeast was hammered by frigid rain or snow on Thanksgiving, a bitter blast of Arctic air is set to envelop much of the country by the time travelers head home this weekend.
In New York City, sopping-wet revelers braved temperatures in the 40s to watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on Thursday, where drenched, poncho-clad participants performed under dark, rainy clouds.
As that system moves offshore early Friday, cold air will infiltrate parts of the country, bringing a brutal chill for much of the northern and central US.
“The first significant Arctic outbreak of the season arrives in the northern Plains on Thanksgiving,” the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center said.
“The cold will advance farther south and east through much of the Plains and Midwest on Friday and stick around through the weekend.”
Forecasters warned wind chills could plummet to dangerous levels over the next several days.
“At the peak of the Arctic Outbreak, minimum wind chills should fall below zero for much of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Wind chills across much of the Dakotas and Minnesota will plunge below 15 degrees below zero – with some areas suffering wind chills as dangerous as 40 degrees below zero.
“This will pose an increased risk of hypothermia and frostbite on exposed skin,” the weather agency warned.
“Aside from bitterly cold wind chills, this Arctic outbreak will also lead to heavy lake-effect snowfall through Monday.”
The wintry weather system could dump 6 to 18 inches of snow in parts of New York state, including Buffalo and Watertown, and whip the same areas with 35 mph gusts.
“Formidable lake-effect snow bands and snow showers will develop east and southeast of the Great Lakes, resulting in significant accumulations and drifting snow in the hardest hit areas,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
“Travel disruptions are likely, especially on I-90 between Cleveland and Buffalo and I-81 north of Syracuse (New York). Travel could be very difficult to impossible with multiple feet of snow in the hardest hit locations.”
Even Texas and the Southeast aren’t immune from the freeze. Temperatures in parts of West Texas will plunge to the 20s by Friday morning.
And parts of North and South Carolina will endure freezing temperatures Friday evening into Saturday morning.
But for some in the northern parts of the US, a holiday weekend treat could soon be on the horizon – literally.
A recent solar flare could make the Northern Lights visible to the northern tier of the US by Friday evening.
And unlike recent, short-lived cold snaps, the wintry surge arriving this weekend will last through much of the first week of December – ushering in festive holiday weather."

Editor’s Note: Click here for the latest forecast on the storm. This is no longer being updated.
A storm and the first punch of winterlike chill will combine to cause Thanksgiving travel headaches across the eastern half of the United States as Mother Nature serves up a smorgasbord of sloppy weather.
The storm will roll through parts of the Midwest and South Wednesday night and spread across the East on Thanksgiving Day. At the same time, frigid air will surge into the US like shoppers clamoring for Black Friday deals.
The storm’s exact track is still unclear and will dictate which areas receive holiday snow and which areas end up with a wet, dreary mess. But two scenarios are in play and in each there will be a disruptive storm for last second travelers.
Scenario one: A stronger, faster storm
The first scenario would have a storm develop in the Plains Wednesday and strengthen as it heads east. It would become quite a potent force by Wednesday night as it spreads rain from the Midwest to the South.
It would take a turn to the northeast once it reaches the Appalachian Mountains and track along their spine Thursday, tapping into some cold, Canadian air before making a beeline for the New England Coast overnight.
This would deliver a round of heavy, wet snow to elevated areas of the interior Northeast Thursday while rain drenches lower elevations.
Wind speeds would also increase Thursday in the East with widespread gusts up to 30 mph possible. Higher gusts are possible for areas closer to the coast, especially from the Carolinas to southern New England.
Gusty winds could disrupt both air and road travel for truly last-minute travelers on Thanksgiving Day. The combination of wet weather and gusty winds could also bring down trees or power lines.
The storm would reach northern Maine by Friday morning and exit the US shortly thereafter. This would make for largely dry, but still breezy weather for the East for Friday and the weekend.
Scenario two: a weaker, slower storm
Another possible scenario would see the heaviest rain and risk for wet snow largely shift out of the Northeast and instead create a much wetter Thanksgiving for the mid-Atlantic.
The storm would develop late Wednesday night around the Mississippi or Tennessee valleys in this scenario. It would then slowly track through the mid-Atlantic through Thursday night and reach the Atlantic Friday morning.
This would bring more rain to the Southeast and mid-Atlantic Thursday while limiting chances for drenching rain and accumulating snow in the Northeast.
But how close to the coast the storm lingers once it reaches the Atlantic Friday will affect post-holiday travel.
A mix of rain and snow could develop in the Northeast and creep closer to the coast if the storm hugs the coast and tracks toward New England. This could make conditions a sloppy mess Friday at airports in the Boston area and for people traveling along the nearby Interstate-95 corridor.
Wet weather would be minimal for these areas if the storm tracks farther away from the coast Friday.
Coldest air of the season on the way
A widespread rush of cold, Canadian air is incoming for a huge part of the US, regardless of the late-week storm’s ultimate track.
Chilly air will start to filter into the northern states early this week before a significant push of winterlike air becomes widespread Thursday.
Chicago will struggle to reach the mid-30s on Thanksgiving Day — a temperature more appropriate for late December. Parts of North Dakota will barely reach the teens and will feel more like January.
Millions from coast to coast will be frigid by Friday.
High temperatures as far south as the Gulf Coast will likely be 10 or more degrees below normal and some locations might not reach the 60s.
Many locales in the central and eastern US will experience their coldest conditions so far this season over the weekend.
Philadelphia hasn’t recorded a high in the 30s since February but could come close both Saturday and Sunday. The same can be said of New York City.
The push of frigid air later this week will also flip the switch on the Great Lakes’ lake-effect snow machine. Cold, Canadian air rushing over the record-warm lakes will set the stage for lake-effect snow that could persist into next week for some areas.
Cold air will stick around for much of the East as the calendar flips to December and could last through the first week of the new month, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center."
World agrees to climate deal on financial aid for developing countries after summit nearly implodes,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/23/climate/cop29-agreement/index.html,"World agrees to climate deal on financial aid for developing countries after summit nearly implodes
Follow:
The world agreed to a new climate deal at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, Saturday, with wealthy countries pledging to provide $300 billion annually by 2035 to poorer countries to help them cope with the increasingly catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis — a figure many developing countries criticized as vastly insufficient.
The agreement came after more than two weeks of bitter divisions and fractious negotiations, thrown into chaos by boycotts, political spats and open celebrations of fossil fuels.
At points there was fear the talks would implode, as groups representing vulnerable small island states and the least-developed countries walked out of negotiations Saturday. But at 2:40 a.m. local time Sunday, more than 30 hours after deadline, the gavel finally went down on the agreement between nearly 200 countries.
“People doubted that Azerbaijan could deliver. They doubted that everyone could agree. They were wrong on both,” said Mukhtar Babayev, the Azerbaijani state-oil company veteran and president of COP29.
The $300 billion will go to vulnerable, poorer nations to help them cope with increasingly devastating extreme weather and to transition their economies toward clean energy.
“It has been a difficult journey, but we’ve delivered a deal,” said Simon Stiell, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. “This new finance goal is an insurance policy for humanity, amid worsening climate impacts hitting every country.”
The amount pledged, however, falls far short of the $1.3 trillion economists say is needed to help developing countries cope with a climate crisis they have done least to cause — and there has been a furious reaction from many developing countries.
In a fiery speech immediately after the gavel went down, India’s representative Chandni Raina slammed the $300 billion as “abysmally poor” and a “paltry sum,” calling the agreement “nothing more than an optical illusion” and unable to “address the enormity of the challenge we all face.”
Others were equally damning in their criticism.
“We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need,” said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy.
Stege heavily criticized the talks as showing the “very worst of political opportunism.” Fossil fuel interests “have been determined to block progress and undermine the multilateral goals we’ve worked to build,” she said in a statement.
What the deal sets out
COP29 focused heavily on finance, a vital climate issue but one of the thorniest politically.
Rich countries, which are overwhelmingly responsible for historical climate change, agreed in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing countries. That pledge, already viewed as woefully insufficient, was only met in 2022, two years past the deadline.
The task at Baku was to come up with a new number.
The new deal agreed to on Saturday requires wealthy countries, including the US and European nations, to provide $300 billion every year by 2035, made up of public and private finance.
While the agreement also refers to a wider ambition to scale up to $1.3 trillion, developing nations wanted rich countries to commit to taking on a much larger share of this, and for the money to come predominantly in the form of grants rather than loans, which they fear will trap them further in debt.
The G77 group of developing countries had called for a sum of $500 billion. But richer nations rejected higher figures as unrealistic given current economic circumstances.
“We have arrived at the boundary between what is politically achievable today in developed countries and what would make a difference in developing countries,” said Avinash Persaud, special advisor on climate change to the President of the Inter-American Development Bank.
There was also a push for richer emerging economies such as China and Saudi Arabia to contribute to the climate funding package, but the agreement only “encourages” developing countries to make voluntary contributions, and places no obligations on them.
Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute called the deal “a flawed compromise” that reflects the “harder geopolitical terrain the world finds itself in.”
A chaotic COP
The summit took place at the end of a year “virtually certain” to be the hottest on record and one in which the world has been hammered by deadly extreme weather, including back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought in southern Africa.
The urgency of dealing with climate change has never been clearer. But this was always going to be a tricky COP.
It took place in Azerbaijan, a petrostate, and was awash in fossil fuel interests. More than 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists or industry players registered to attend the talks, outnumbering almost all country delegations, according to an analysis by a coalition of groups called Kick Big Polluters Out.
The shadow of Donald Trump’s election in the US also loomed over proceedings. Trump has called the climate crisis a hoax, pledged to “drill, baby, drill,” and vowed to pull the US out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, stoking concerns about the future of multinational climate action.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, which has pushed against ambitious action at past climate summits, seemed even more emboldened in Baku, publicly and explicitly rejecting any reference to oil, coal and gas in the deal.
“It’s been another shady, oil-stained COP,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “Public interest in this COP has been low and cynicism feels like it has reached an all time high,” she said.
Many climate groups have heavily criticized the summit and its outcome.
“This has been the most horrendous climate negotiations in years due to the bad faith of developed countries,” said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network. “This was meant to be the finance COP, but the Global North turned up with a plan to betray the Global South.”
The outcome “offers false hope to those already bearing the brunt of climate disasters,” said Harjeet Singh of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative. “We must persist in our fight, demanding a significant increase in financing and holding developed countries to account,” he added.

Follow:
Record-breaking ocean temperatures, fueled by planet-warming pollution, have turbocharged dozens of Atlantic hurricanes over the last few years, making them more potent and dangerous by increasing their wind speeds.
Every hurricane in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was made stronger than it otherwise would have been without human-caused climate change, according to analysis from nonprofit climate research group Climate Central. Wind speeds of the 11 hurricanes were increased by 9 to 28 mph by water that was up to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer because of climate change.
“Every hurricane in 2024 was stronger than it would have been 100 years ago,” said Daniel Gilford, climate scientist at Climate Central and lead author of the report. “Through record-breaking ocean warming, human carbon pollution is worsening hurricane catastrophes in our communities.”
The analysis built off the scientific framework of a separate analysis from the group released Wednesday and found 84% of hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 were more intense than they would have been without climate change. The wind speeds of the hurricanes were cranked up by an average of 18 mph, which caused 30 of them to go up at least one category higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.
The studies’ authors say the new analyses prove how much “human beings have influenced storm intensities.”
At least 90% of warming over the past several decades has taken place in oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Water in the Atlantic where hurricanes roam was at or near-record-breaking levels throughout hurricane season. Hurricanes are feeding off this extra energy, causing them to strengthen and even rapidly intensify more frequently — or have an increase in wind speeds of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less.
Nine of this season’s 11 hurricanes rapidly intensified and climbed up the hurricane category scale due to climate change-driven ocean heat. Category 5 Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified by 95 mph in just 24 hours, faster than any other storm in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Climate Central researchers also found that human-caused climate change made exceptionally warm ocean temperatures that fueled Milton’s explosion 400 to 800 times more likely. They also found that Milton wouldn’t have reached Category 5.
The researchers found hurricanes Debby and Oscar also would have remained tropical storms instead of turning into hurricanes in a world without planet-warming pollution.
Other scientists not involved in the study agreed with the researchers’ overall finding that that human-caused global warming was intensifying storms, but urged caution around the specific increase in wind speeds, particularly with projecting the influence of global warming on future storms.
“I see this paper as a good way to estimate how multiple anthropogenic factors have increased hurricane intensities in the Atlantic, but I do not think that these estimates can be projected into the future,” said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and retired NOAA climate scientist.
Kossin said he’s not confident that future increases in climate change-fueled ocean warming will directly lead to hurricanes becoming stronger at the same rate as they have in the past. This is because ocean temperatures are influenced by various factors other than carbon pollution, and the impact of temperature changes on hurricanes could differ in the future.
Still, climate experts say one thing is certain: as global temperatures continue to rise, the potential for more powerful and destructive hurricanes like the ones that formed in the Atlantic this year becomes increasingly likely."

Summerlike warmth has been eating away at fall in the United States this year as the season continues to wither in a warming world.
If you feel cheated out of crisp autumn weather this year, know you’re not alone. This fall is on pace to be one of, if not the warmest on record across the Lower 48, a CNN analysis of preliminary data from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information shows.
The average temperature across the Lower 48 this fall is more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal as of November 15. The warmest fall on record in 2016 was 4.04 degrees warmer than average. This fall will likely finish cooler than 7 degrees above normal with storms on the way this week, but it has still been the warmest start to fall on record.
It’s been warm even when looking at specific cities and not the country as a whole. Hundreds of locales spanning every region of the continental US are experiencing one of the warmest falls to date, data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center shows.
“It’s not the fall weather of past generations,” said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist with the non-profit research group Climate Central. “Fall is not gone completely, but I think that this fall especially shows us that it is a shrinking season.”
Fall has warmed by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1970 in the Lower 48, according to data from Climate Central. It’s happening faster in the Southwest and the Rockies, but every region of the country has warmed because of climate change.
Summer warmth is starting earlier during spring months and lasting later into the start of fall — eating away at both seasons, according to Winkley.
That’s exactly what happened this year. Summerlike heat dominated the first two months of the season in September and October, fueling the record pace.
Halloween is typically brisk for much of the Lower 48, but the holiday was unrecognizable for millions this year. Trick-or-treaters in much of the East, South and parts of the Midwest  perspired in their costumes after high temperatures reached 80s during the day.
Prolonged heat and extremely dry weather have also been stuck in a loop where each factor continuously makes the other worse this season. The combination has resulted not just in record breaking temperatures, but also some of the worst drought conditions in two decades and destructive wildfires.
Without adequate rain and with persistent heat baking the ground, drought is impacting every Lower 48 state, according to the latest data from the US Drought Monitor.
Some states have experienced a flash drought, or when drought conditions become quite severe in a short timeframe. New Jersey is a prime example: The state had zero drought at the start of fall and now the entire state in at least moderate drought.
Whether this fall ends up as the warmest or one of the warmest depends on how the last two weeks of the season unfold — and at least a temporary pattern change is underway.
A series of storms will track across the Lower 48 this week and bring torrential rain to parts of the West, some wet weather to parched areas farther east and help make the weather finally feel like fall.
But it could be too little, too late. Some brief bouts of fall chill have managed to break through the unseasonable warmth, but it hasn’t been enough to change the season’s warm trajectory — a trend that seems like it will continue.
Forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center say above average warmth will linger for millions in the US through at least the end of November."

A series of storms is set to move across the US this week, and some of them could help bring much needed relief to areas experiencing drought.
Ongoing storms across the Southern Plains –– a region consisting of Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas –– are expected to shift north throughout the day on Monday, bringing widespread rainfall across the Midwest and the Central Plains.
A tornado watch has been issued for parts of western and central Oklahoma and parts of northern Texas until 10:00 a.m. Monday. Over 2 million people are under this tornado watch, including residents of Oklahoma City.
There have been well over 1,700 tornado reports this year, far above the year-to-date average of 1,274.
The National Weather Service has also issued flood watches across parts of Texas and Oklahoma through the day on Monday and into Louisiana beginning Monday evening.
Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches is expected across the Plains, while the New Orleans area could see 3 to 5 inches with isolated chances of totals exceeding 5 inches.
Cities including Oklahoma City experienced one of their driest Octobers on record. However, in a climate with more extreme weather events, November has become one of the wettest on record for the city.
Almost 7 inches of rainfall has been recorded in Oklahoma City this month, making it the fourth wettest November on record with 12 more days left until December.
Storm heading eastward
While cities including Atlanta and Memphis could see rainfall by midweek, cities across the Northeast, including New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Boston, will have to wait until the end of the week for their chance of precipitation.
Many of these cities are coming off some of their driest Octobers and are in desperate need of rain.
And in the West
A separate series of storms is also set to affect the West, bringing rounds of valley rainfall and heavy mountain snowfall.
Winter weather alerts are in place for seven Western states – Washington, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico – while up to a foot of snow is expected across the Cascades and the northern Rockies.
The strongest storm across the West is set to begin Tuesday, where heavy rainfall and mountain snowfall are expected. Snowfall could reach 2 to 3 feet in parts of the Cascades between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Parts of Oregon, Washington and northern California will also experience heavy lower-elevation rainfall. From Tuesday night through Saturday, these states could see 6 to 14 inches of rain, with isolated totals around the King Range potentially reaching 21 inches.
These rains could cause rivers to rapidly rise and could also cause flash flooding and mudslides."

The country accounted for a tiny fraction of the world’s carbon pollution at the turn of the 20th century, but its emissions surged as it rapidly transformed into the world’s factory and, more recently, a powerful tech innovator. It’s now the world’s biggest carbon polluter by far, accounting for nearly a third of global planet-heating emissions.
Carbon pollution is worryingly at an all-time high, but there’s a glimmer of hope: emissions growth in China is slowing. Some climate experts and senior US officials think China’s emissions will soon peak and fall.
A downturn couldn’t come any sooner. The year 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record, and scientists say humanity is fast running out of time to stop burning fossil fuels and avoid the most catastrophic outcomes of climate change.
It’s not that China is using less energy — it’s using more than ever — but it’s just adding wind and solar power to its grid at an astonishing pace.
“It’s extraordinary,” said Jonathan Pershing, a former State Department climate diplomat who now directs the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation’s environment program. “I look at it and say, this is kind of what we want the world to do.”
China, for all its world-heating pollution, is a global renewables powerhouse.
The country is constructing two-thirds — nearly 339 gigawatts — of the world’s utility-scale solar and wind projects. That would be enough to power more than 250 million homes, nearly double the number of homes that exist in the US. That is in addition to the 758 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity it has already built, according to the Global Energy Monitor.
Chinese solar is now expanding so fast that by the early 2030s, the country will generate more power from the sun than the amount of electricity the US will consume altogether, according to the International Energy Agency.
China is also leading the world in exporting solar panels around the globe — with the majority going to Europe and noticeable growth in Africa. The US, meanwhile, has put restrictions on Chinese solar imports due to forced labor concerns, and is focusing on building out its own domestic supply chain for solar.
While many Western nations make ambitious climate reduction targets only to miss them, China has a tendency to under-promise and over-perform, said John Podesta, White House senior advisor for international climate policy.
“In some of their planning scenarios, they’re planning for 100 gigawatts a year, but they’re building at close to 300 gigawatts a year,” Podesta told CNN. Chinese President Xi Jinping previously committed to constructing 1,200 gigawatts of renewable generation by 2030 – a target the nation has hit six years ahead of schedule.
The bigger question now is whether this clean energy will also lead to coal plant retirements. Wind and solar are now capable of generating 37% of the country’s power, according to Global Energy Monitor, already displacing coal’s dominance. China is retiring its oldest coal plants and operating others less, but it hasn’t stopped building new plants. “I think they probably need to go further in the next decade to begin to retire that coal-fired power,” Podesta said. “They have the capacity to do that.”
Podesta told CNN the US believes China is in the “throes” of peaking. How fast and far they now cut those emissions has enormous implications for the planet.
China’s current climate commitment is to peak its planet-warming pollution sometime before 2030. For the next round of climate commitments, due in February, Podesta and US officials are urging China to cut their emissions 30% by 2035 – a steep drop.
“The world is looking for a significant commitment to reduce emissions by the world’s largest emitter. They’d do well to come forward with a significant cut.”
The amount of global warming that could be avoided by such a cut is huge. If China cuts its climate pollution by the 30% US officials suggest, it would save 4.7 gigatons from entering the atmosphere. That’s the same amount the US is projected to pollute this year, according to State Department officials.
CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. In a recent press briefing, Department of Climate Change director Xia Yingxian said China was actively considering its 2035 target for cutting emissions, which all countries party to the Paris Agreement are obliged to announce next year.
It’s tough to forecast exactly when China’s emissions will peak, or if they already have. Recent independent analysis by UK-based climate website Carbon Brief found China’s emissions fell by 1% earlier this year, the first time the country registered an emissions decline since Covid-19 shuttered its economy.
Experts also say it’s too soon to say whether this drop is evidence of a sustained trend. And a 1% drop is not nearly enough to hit the Chinese government’s own climate targets for next year.
But what’s clear is a fundamental shift is underway in China’s economy. As China’s post-Covid infrastructure boom has slowed, so too has demand for heavy industry materials like cement and steel. Manufacturing of solar panels and electric vehicles, meanwhile, is ramping up.
“I want to be cautious here, but we are seeing a U-turn in the last few months,” Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told CNN.
Since 2015, China has been responsible for 90% of global emissions growth, Shuo said, so its emissions plateauing “would definitely mean that global emissions will peak and plateau.”
“This will mark a very significant turning point in the global effort to combat climate change,” Shuo said. “This will still be an insufficient first step. But I think nevertheless, it is important milestone.”"
Tropical Storm Sara dumps more than 20 inches of rain on parts of Honduras,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/weather/tropical-storm-sara-florida-hurricane-season-climate/index.html,"Tropical Storm Sara dumps more than 20 inches of rain on parts of Honduras
Follow:
Tropical Storm Sara is unleashing heavy rainfall in northeastern Honduras, with life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides anticipated through the weekend.
Nearly 20 inches of rain had already fallen in parts of Honduras as of Friday morning with more to come.
Earlier forecasts from the National Hurricane Center told residents along the eastern Gulf of Mexico to monitor the storm for its potential to reach the US, but the center now believes the storm might not survive its trek through Central America and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.
Sara, which formed Thursday afternoon as it closed in on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, is the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. It’s a season that’s lived up to initial hyperactive forecasts and hasn’t played by the rules.
Tropical activity should be winding down in November, but Sara is now the third named storm this month thanks to exceptionally warm water wrought by climate change.
The storm, which briefly made landfall Thursday night in northeastern Honduras, may make another brief landfall as it skirts the coast.
Sara’s ongoing heavy rainfall could trigger “life-threatening” flooding in parts of Honduras, the NHC warned. A few places in Honduras could measure around 30 inches of rain while double-digit rainfall totals may impact other parts of Central America. That could mean “widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides.”
After pushing away from Honduras later this weekend, Sara will threaten Belize with storm surge and gusty winds.
Tropical storm alerts were in effect from Honduras to Guatemala and Belize Thursday. Additional alerts for more of Belize and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula are possible in the coming days.
Multiple scenarios for what could happen to Sara after its interaction with Honduras and the Yucatán Peninsula were possible earlier this week, but one appears to be winning out and it’s good news for a storm-weary US Gulf Coast that’s been hit by five hurricanes this year.
Sara will likely undergo too much interaction with land in Central America and Mexico to survive into the Gulf of Mexico early next week as originally forecast, the NHC said Thursday afternoon.

Urban areas are getting hotter. A startup from one of the world’s hottest cities wants to help
Follow:
Climate change is impacting urban areas especially hard, and densely populated cities are suffering the most.
The urban heat island effect means that city temperatures can be several degrees higher than nearby rural regions. That’s because materials like concrete and asphalt absorb and radiate heat. Vehicles and air-conditioning units expel heat, and towering buildings block wind flow.
Officials across the globe are trying to cool cities down. In Chicago, which has a history of fatal heatwaves, more than 500 rooftops have been covered with vegetation, which releases cooling water vapor and acts as natural insulation for the building. Los Angeles, which has a vast network of freeways, has painted some of its roads with a solar-reflective material.
But detailed information about urban temperatures is scarce. That became clear to entrepreneur Jay Sadiq soon after he founded a startup in Abu Dhabi to modify asphalt to absorb less heat, when a potential client encouraged him to identify the hottest parts of the city, where the material would be most beneficial.
Sadiq couldn’t find the level of granular data he needed, so he started working on harnessing the information himself. Today, his company FortyGuard is focused on leveraging data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide a detailed view of urban temperature dynamics.
He hopes that it will enable urban planners, chief heat officers, businesses, and real estate developers to make data-driven decisions, and residents to better plan their lives.
Difficult data collection
Extreme heat can cause heat-related illnesses and death, particularly for vulnerable groups like young children and the elderly. Global heat-related mortality for people aged 65 and older increased approximately 85% between 2017 and 2021.
As billions of people move to urban areas in the coming decades, between half and three-quarters of the global population could be exposed to life-threatening extreme heat and humidity by 2100, according the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Rising temperatures also makes it harder to sleep at night, and difficult to be productive during the day, especially for outdoor workers.
Although urban heat is gaining more attention, most weather stations haven’t been built to specifically address the issue, and they’re often located at an airport or atop a hillside – areas that aren’t representative of the temperature on a city sidewalk.
“Historically, most meteorological agencies would be tasked with monitoring the weather at scales larger than cities,” says James Voogt, a professor in the department of Geography and Environment at the University of Western Ontario, who is an expert in urban climatology.
Satellites that measure surface temperature can cover wide areas but can’t provide detailed information about neighborhood hotspots. And trees and tall buildings can block satellites from recording temperatures at ground level. “It doesn’t see the shade underneath,” says Voogt.
Some cities have started collecting information using sensors mounted on streetlights or buses, and others, including Hong Kong, have deployed dense urban meteorological networks. “But not many cities have such a dense measurement network,” says Chao Ren, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong, who specializes in applied climatology and climate design.
Urban heat tech
FortyGuard, which today has 16 employees and offices in Abu Dhabi and San Jose, California, collects 32 billion data points daily from third-party providers, but Sadiq says he can’t reveal much about their sources, given market competition.
It then uses AI to produce models that take into account variables that impact how temperature is felt – including a city’s elevation, vegetation, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover, to give a fuller view of local temperature dynamics, he says. “Our approach goes beyond measuring air temperature at a specific point in time,” Sadiq adds.
Some of the company’s most robust information is about certain US cities, allowing it to model urban temperature for each 10 square meters, with 89% accuracy, according to Sadiq.
FortyGuard offers advisory services, and it has worked with clients like Masdar City, an experimental “sustainable city” in the United Arab Emirates, to help it pinpoint heat hotspots to add trees and water features.
But the startup, which is “about to about to close a large funding round,” is aiming to position itself as a technology company, says Sadiq. He hopes to integrate its technology into existing platforms, like a real estate or map platform. That could enable homebuyers to figure out the least hot neighborhood in a city, or runners to determine the best route for a morning run, he says.
Technology platforms are already incorporating climate-related information from other providers. In late September, US real estate website Zillow announced that its listings would feature information such as wildfire risk, air quality and heat.
Others are applying AI to urban heat issues. In September, Google announced a new Heat Resilience tool, which applies AI to aerial and satellite images to help cities deal with extreme heat.
Voogt and Ren said that it’s difficult to comment on FortyGuard’s urban heat intelligence without knowing more about its data sources, validation methods and technology. “The key element is how such AI is being trained and on what,” says Voogt.
But there is “definitely a need and demand for high spatial resolution temperatures in urban environments,” he adds.
Ren said what’s most important about urban heat information is how it will be used. While interest in urban heat is increasing, some places are doing better than others at addressing it, by educating residents about the issue, creating warning systems, or incorporating mitigation considerations into building codes or city planning.
“The question is really, who will be the end user of your data, and who will put such urban heat information into their practices?” she says.

It’s not just Democrats — Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate money,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/climate/climate-law-trump-republicans/index.html,"It’s not just Democrats — Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate money
Follow:
President Joe Biden’s climate law is on the chopping block as Republicans prepare to have full control in Washington.
But it’s not just Democrats gearing up to protect the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy policies. President-elect Donald Trump is out on a limb within even his own party as he vows to the kill clean energy tax subsidies that automakers, the fossil fuel industry and Republican lawmakers have become increasingly amenable toward over the past two years.
“We need to look at the IRA, and instead of taking a sledgehammer to it, take a scalpel to it,” Republican Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia told CNN. “There are some good parts … There are parts of it that do make sense.”
The “good parts” for Republicans are the hundreds of billions of dollars being funneled into clean energy projects, the overwhelming majority of which are going to Republican districts.
Close to 80% of the $243 billion-worth of projects that are either completed or under construction are in GOP districts. The same goes for another $435 billion in clean energy projects companies have announced but have not yet built, according to an exclusive CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The data shows Biden’s climate law has had a profound impact on the American economy in its first two years, said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan thinktank.
But with Trump gunning to repeal the law and Congressional Republicans looking for ways to offset new tax cuts next year, the $435 billion in new, not-yet-built projects is increasingly vulnerable.
“If that investment was to dry up, it would significantly impact the economic prospects particularly of the rural and manufacturing communities where most of that investment has been flowing,” Houser told CNN.
In other words, if Republicans successfully repeal Biden’s climate and clean energy law, their districts stand to lose the most.
Carter is far from the only Republican angling to defend the clean energy funds against Trump. He’s one of 18 House Republicans who signed a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson this summer strongly urging Johnson to not repeal the climate law.
“A full repeal would create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return,” Republicans wrote in the letter, adding they had heard from industry and constituents “who fear the energy tax regime will once again be turned on its head due to Republican repeal efforts.”
Some Republicans on that letter lost their races for reelection to Democrats, but Carter told CNN there are “enough” lawmakers who share the view “to make a difference” when it comes time to vote.
“I don’t think it has to be many,” he said. “Obviously, we don’t have a big majority and it’s going to be very tight.”
Biden’s climate law is a manufacturing bill by design, reopening dormant plants and opening new ones to build electric vehicles and their batteries.
The bill also has generous subsidies for wind and solar farms, nuclear power, and newer industries like hydrogen and carbon capture, which aims to scrub climate pollution out of smokestack exhaust before it reaches the atmosphere.
Carter’s Georgia district is home to a massive Hyundai EV and battery production plant that was funded by the IRA and is now open. Hyundai spent nearly $7 billion to build the plant, which is expected to create over 8,000 jobs.
The district of North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson — the head of House Republicans’ campaign committee — has seen more investment than any other, thanks to a colossal Toyota car battery plant being built there. Rhodium and MIT data shows Toyota has already pushed more than $8.2 billion into building the factory and has pledged to spend $5.7 billion more as it plans to triple the factory’s size.
“Those facilities are going to be creating a lot of jobs and economic growth,” said Adrian Deveny, founder of consulting firm Climate Vision and a former top Senate staffer who led the IRA clean energy negotiations. “If you have legislation that repeals the tax credits, those facilities are going to stop construction, or they’ll never even start construction.”
The bill also contained billions in consumer subsidies to help millions of households save money on solar panels, electric vehicles, appliances and home insulation. The conventional wisdom among many experts is these consumer subsidies could be more vulnerable to Republican repeal efforts than the industry money, but subsidies like the EV tax credits help drive demand for electric vehicles – necessary to keep factories in GOP districts open.
“The extent to which (House Republicans) fight to save the EV tax credits, I think really will come down to what are they hearing from those automakers about how important those tax credits are for those manufacturing facilities to be able to continue,” Houser said.
Conservative groups and companies who are using the clean energy tax credits are already starting to lobby lawmakers to save them.
“The need to explain what the tax credits do, particularly in the long run, is incredibly important,” Heather Reams, the president of the right-leaning nonprofit Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, told CNN. “To demonstrate that these tax credits are really a net profit for the economy, that really is the name of the game.”"

Follow:
Editor’s Note: Read our new story for the latest updates on Tropical Storm Sara.
Tropical Storm Sara is expected in the Caribbean soon and will deliver “life-threatening” impacts to parts of Central America as it begins a journey that could once again bring a tropical threat into the Gulf of Mexico.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are urging residents of the eastern Gulf Coast, including Floridians, to monitor the forecast closely because the storm could reach the US next week.
Soon-to-be Sara is another example of an Atlantic hurricane season that hasn’t played by the rules. Tropical activity should be winding down in November, but this will be the third named storm this month instead thanks to exceptionally warm water wrought by climate change.
For now, it is Tropical Depression Nineteen with 35 mph maximum sustained winds and is located 65 miles east of the Honduras/Nicaragua border in the Caribbean Sea, according to the NHC.
The storm will strengthen as it meanders and nearly stalls over the very warm water of the western Caribbean Sea — the same body of water that fueled Hurricane Rafael — and will be a tropical storm while near the northern coast of Honduras over the weekend.
Tropical storm alerts have been issued for parts of Honduras and Nicaragua, with the storm’s wind and rain expected to arrive as soon as Thursday evening and ramp up Friday.
The storm will bring “life-threatening” flooding rainfall up to 30 inches to Honduras and double-digit rainfall totals to other parts of Central America, the NHC warned. That could mean “widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides.”
It will then threaten Belize and the Yucatán Peninsula with storm surge and gusty winds by early next week, so residents should prepare.
The potential impacts on the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba, remain uncertain, and those in these areas should closely monitor forecasts because the forecast becomes extremely uncertain beyond this weekend.
US threat?
There are a few potential scenarios on the table for how formidable the storm could be and whether it could reach the US next week. They all hinge on how close Sara gets to the coast of Honduras over the next few days.
The official forecast from the hurricane center has the system skimming along the coast of Honduras over the weekend, but this could change.
If it makes landfall in Honduras this weekend and moves far enough inland, it could deteriorate while over land, cut off from the warm water fueling it. This scenario would bring strong winds and torrential rain to Central America, but could keep the storm away from the US entirely or have it approach as a very weak storm.
If Sara remains very close to the coast of Central America, but briefly moves over land, it could eventually emerge in the southern Gulf of Mexico next week as a weak, but slightly stronger storm than in the first scenario. This scenario would lessen the blow if it were to reach the US. It would still unleash life-threatening flooding rainfall in Central America and head for dangerous strike on Belize and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula
But if the system stays far enough away from the coast and over the Caribbean’s tremendously warm water, it could strengthen considerably — and possibly rapidly intensify. This would bring more substantial impacts to Central America, the Yucatán and Belize and a much more troubling forecast for the US.
Sea surface temperatures in the Caribbean are currently their second-warmest on record — just behind 2023’s record-breaking heat. They’re warmer than they should be at the peak of hurricane season and could continue to produce unusually strong storms. Warmer bodies of water are fueling stronger storms and more rapid intensification as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.
Sara could make a gradual turn to the northwest after it exits Central America, head for a powerful strike on the Yucatán and potentially reach the eastern Gulf of Mexico as a much stronger storm that could make a run at Florida next week. The Gulf is record-warm for this time of year and likewise could boost or sustain any system that reaches it.
All scenarios are still possible, but forecast models are starting to agree that the storm will get much closer to the Honduras coast than initially thought Wednesday, making the more troubling scenario less likely.
Five hurricanes have slammed into the US Gulf Coast this year.
If this system were to make landfall in the US, it could challenge the latest landfalling hurricane on record. The current record rests with Hurricane Kate, which made landfall as a Category 2 storm in Florida on November 21, 1985.
Hurricane season officially comes to an end on November 30, but named storms have formed in December in the past."
"Planet-heating pollution to hit all-time high, dashing hopes it would start to drop in 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/climate/planet-heating-pollution-record-high/index.html,"Planet-heating pollution to hit all-time high, dashing hopes it would start to drop in 2024
Follow:
Global levels of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels will hit record levels this year, according to new projections, dashing hopes 2024 would be the year they plateau or fall.
Fossil fuel pollution is set to rise to 37.4 billion metric tons this year, an increase of 0.8% from 2023, a report found. Global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase.
The news comes as global leaders gather at the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan — talks which have been overshadowed by anxiety over what a new Trump administration will mean for global climate action. The urgency is clear, however, this year is “virtually certain” to be the hottest on record, and has seen back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought.
“The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly dramatic, yet we still see no sign that burning of fossil fuels has peaked,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter, who led the study, published Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists.
While fossil fuels make up the bulk of planet-heating pollution, the other main source is land-use change, including deforestation. Those emissions are also set to go up in 2024, according to the report, exacerbated by this year’s severe droughts and fires.
There was some more positive news: emissions are set to decline in the US and Europe, and China’s emissions are slowing, and could even see a decline this year, the research projected. But that progress is offset by increases in much of the rest of the world, including India.
Total global climate pollution will reach 41.6 billion metric tons this year, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year, according to the report.
The increase may not seem huge, but it puts the world way off track for tackling the climate crisis.
A UN report published in October said global carbon emissions were slowly plateauing and had raised the possibility they could fall this year.
Fossil fuel pollution needs to roughly halve over this decade to keep global warming lower than 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold countries have pledged to try to stay below in the Paris climate agreement.
Climate change is already having catastrophic impacts. But scientists warn that at 1.5 degrees, it begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt — including potentially triggering devastating climate tipping points.
Humanity has already lived through 12-month periods above this critical climate limit but scientists are more concerned about longer timeframes. Tuesday’s study estimates that at current rates of emissions, there is a 50% chance the world will breach 1.5 degrees consistently in about six years.
Some companies and governments have emphasized carbon removal as a key way to bring global temperatures down, but current technology is only removing around one-millionth of the carbon pollution produced by fossil fuels, the report found.
“Time is running out,” Friedlingstein said, adding, “world leaders meeting at COP29 must bring about rapid and deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions.”"
Biden just finalized a major climate rule. This one could be tricky for Trump to dismantle,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/climate/methane-rule-biden-trump/index.html,"Biden just finalized a major climate rule. This one could be tricky for Trump to dismantle
Follow:
The Environmental Protection Agency just finalized one of the Biden administration’s only outstanding climate rules, aimed at cracking down on leaks of methane — a potent planet-warming gas with an outsized impact on the climate.
The rule, proposed nearly a year ago, was mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act, which could make it more difficult for the second Trump administration to dismantle.
The new rule charges high-emitting oil and gas producers a fee for wasting methane above a certain threshold by venting or flaring it into the atmosphere instead of capturing it. The methane fee will be charged by the federal government until the companies fix the leaks.
This fee was paired with financial incentives for oil and gas companies to fix leaky pipelines or infrastructure.
Methane is an odorless and invisible gas that has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide. Methane is the main component of the gas that heats our homes and powers our stoves, and it’s one of the main byproducts of oil and gas drilling.
It’s also dramatically warming the planet. An international body of scientists has concluded that the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is higher now than any time in at least 800,000 years. It’s responsible for as much as a third of the global warming the planet has experienced so far, according to the EPA.
The rule could prove tricky for the incoming Trump administration to overturn because the program was included in Biden’s climate law, which passed Congress in 2022. Undoing it would take another act of Congress; while not impossible if Republicans take the House of Representatives, it could be an uphill climb and take longer than if the Trump administration were acting on its own.
“EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,” EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.
According to the EPA, this rule alone would prevent 1.2 million metric tons of methane from polluting the atmosphere – the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year."
2024 will be the first year on record to smash a warming limit scientists warned about,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/climate/warmest-year-on-record/index.html,"2024 will be the first year on record to smash a warming limit scientists warned about

New data confirms 2024 will be the hottest year on record and the first calendar year to exceed the Paris Agreement threshold — devastating news for the planet that comes as America chooses a president that has promised to undo its climate progress both at home and abroad.
Nearly all the world’s countries pledged to strive to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius in the Paris Agreement, which scientists said would prevent cascading and worsening impacts such as droughts, heat waves and catastrophic sea level rise. They warn at that level, the human-caused climate crisis — fueled by heat-trapping fossil fuel pollution — begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt.
Data released Wednesday by Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service shows 2024 is “virtually certain” to shoot above that threshold.
President-elect Donald Trump, a noted climate denier, pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement during his first term and has vowed to do it again in his second. But the new data makes it clear further delays in climate action from leading global economies will ensure even higher levels of warming are reached, and with it, ever worsening impacts.
“We don’t have time to stop,” Alex Scott, a climate diplomacy strategist at international think tank ECCO said Wednesday.
As climate change-fueled extreme weather is killing more people and costing economies billions of dollars each year, the climate crisis has been given top billing at major international forums like the G7 and G20.
“These are things that a Trump administration will not be able to shy away from,” Scott said.
Not only did President-elect Trump vow to pull the US out of the landmark Paris climate agreement on the campaign trail, but some former Trump officials have floated the idea of pulling the country entirely out of the United Nations treaty to tackle climate change. Doing so would end US participation in international negotiations and make it harder for future administrations to re-enter them.
It would be a more “serious” and “dramatic” step, said Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate think tank E3G and a longtime international climate expert.
Trump’s re-election will likely cast a shadow over COP29, the United Nations-backed international climate talks which kick off Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan. The summit is focused on ramping up finance to tackle the climate crisis.
Global climate negotiations are facing another whiplash moment as Americans seesaw between presidential extremes, said Meyer.
“The US has done this before and the world has gotten kind of tired of this routine,” Meyer said. “On the other hand, the US is a major player on the scene, and I think other countries would want to maintain the ability to try to re-engage it down the road.”
Meyer and other experts said major emitting countries like China and the European Union will have to step up in absence of US climate leadership on the world stage, but added there are concerns other nations will use Trump’s anti-climate stance as an excuse to weaken their own climate ambitions.
In the meantime, global temperatures are climbing. Last month was the second-warmest October, according to Copernicus, and was 1.65 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, when humans began generating fossil fuel pollution.
Extreme weather struck in many places during the month, including Hurricane Milton striking Florida and devastating flash flooding in Spain that killed more than 200 people. Another alarming climate milestones during the month included a lack of snow atop Mt. Fuji in Japan for the first time in 130 years of record keeping."

Tropical Storm Rafael formed in the Caribbean Sea Monday afternoon and could bring a rare November threat to the United States this weekend after tearing through parts of the western Caribbean.
Rafael is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane Tuesday and could rapidly intensify over the warm water of the northwest Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’ll slam Cuba Wednesday and then emerge into the Gulf of Mexico.
From there, the storm’s ultimate path and intensity in the Gulf and potentially along the US Gulf Coast is difficult to pinpoint with confidence because the system has just formed and is still several days away from reaching the area.
“It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast,” the National Hurricane Center said, adding in its 10 p.m. update that predicting the storm’s path “remains a challenge.”
Anyone from the US Gulf Coast to the northeastern Mexico coast will need to monitor updates closely.
Despite the uncertainty, tropical alerts were issued for the Florida Keys Monday afternoon, adding to alerts already in place in Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
Early forecasts from the hurricane center show the system’s center reaching the US Gulf Coast later this weekend, anywhere from the Florida-Alabama border to Louisiana.
But this area could shift dramatically in the coming days while the system tracks through the Caribbean.
The drastic differences between two major forecast models on the storm’s track once it enters the Gulf of Mexico highlight the forecast uncertainty. One depicts Rafael making landfall in western Cuba, then tracking generally to the northwest before making landfall somewhere between Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle. The hurricane center’s forecast looks rather similar to this scenario.
But another model is showing the potential for Rafael to make an abrupt left turn once it gets into the open Gulf. From there it tracks generally to the west and could fall apart entirely or make landfall in northeastern Mexico or the western Gulf Coast instead.
Any shifts will have a significant impact on the flood threat from the storm in Florida and other parts of the Southeast. The storm is enhancing rainfall ahead in these areas ahead of its potential arrival there. This means any areas that do get rain from the storm later this week or weekend will face an increased flood threat.
Five hurricanes have made landfall on the Gulf Coast this year, but this storm seems unlikely to be as severe as hurricanes Helene and Milton because its strength could be hampered by the terrain of Cuba and hostile storm-disrupting winds over the Gulf.

Tropical activity typically winds down in November, but the month still occasionally produces a storm. However, US landfalls are exceptionally rare as 98% of named storms make landfall in the US before November, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry. The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30.
While the threat the system poses to the US is still uncertain, its threats early this week in the Caribbean are much clearer.
The bulk of the system’s storminess was over the Caribbean Sea late Monday, while drenching rain had already begun in parts of Hispaniola and Jamaica. The Cuban government changed hurricane and tropical storm watches to warnings Monday night, the US hurricane center said, adding the Cayman Islands are under a hurricane warning.
The system could bring torrential rainfall and flash flooding to more of the western Caribbean over the next few days. This heavy rainfall could also lead to mudslides, especially in the mountainous terrain of Jamaica and southern Cuba.
Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected for Cuba and Jamaica. Heavy rain will spread into Florida and areas of the Southeast US by mid to late week. The lower and middle Florida Keys could see 1 to 3 inches of rainfall.
Showers and thunderstorms were affecting most parishes in Jamaica while strong, gusty winds were blasting parts of the southern parishes, the country’s meteorological service said in its 8 p.m. ET update.
All in-person classes are canceled Tuesday in Jamaican schools, according to CNN affiliate Radio Jamaica News.
Rafael will also deliver strong, potentially damaging winds, especially once it reaches hurricane strength Tuesday.
Tropical storm-force winds will reach Jamaica overnight Monday or early Tuesday morning and expand to west-central Cuba and the Florida Keys on Wednesday. Hurricane-force winds will roar over parts of the Cayman Islands by Tuesday afternoon and western Cuba on Wednesday.
These powerful winds will also churn up nearby seas and produce storm surge.
Up to 3 feet of storm surge could inundate parts of the Cayman Islands, while up to 9 feet of dangerous surge is possible in western Cuba.
Saltwater flooding for oceanside portions of the Florida Keys could reach up to a foot above recent high tides on Wednesday, according to a statement from the Key West office of the National Weather Service. It also said “a few tornadoes” were possible.

The planet’s largest lake is shrinking fast. Experts fear it may never recover,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/climate/caspian-sea-shrinking-pollution/index.html,"The planet’s largest lake is shrinking fast. Experts fear it may never recover
There’s a spot on the shoreline from where Azamat Sarsenbayev used to jump into the brackish, blue-green Caspian Sea. Only a decade later, it now overlooks bare, stony ground stretching toward the horizon.
The water has receded far and fast from the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan, where the eco-activist has lived his whole life. “It is very difficult to watch,” he said.
More than 1,000 miles to the south, near the Iranian city of Rasht, Khashayar Javanmardi is alarmed. The sea here is choked by pollution.
“I cannot swim anymore … the water changed,” said the photographer, who has traveled the Caspian’s southern shore, documenting its decline.
Both men feel intimately connected to the water they grew up alongside. Both are terrified for its future.
The Caspian Sea is the planet’s largest inland sea and its largest lake, an enormous body of water roughly the size of Montana. Its looping coastline stretches more than 4,000 miles and is shared by five countries: Kazakhstan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan.
These countries rely on it for fishing, farming, tourism and drinking water, as well as its coveted oil and gas reserves. The Caspian also helps regulate this arid region’s climate, providing rainfall and moisture to Central Asia.
But it’s in trouble.
Damming, over-extraction, pollution and, increasingly, the human-caused climate crisis are driving its decline — with some experts fearing the Caspian Sea is being pushed to the point of no return.
While climate change is raising global sea levels, it’s a different story for landlocked seas and lakes like the Caspian. They rely on a delicate balance between water flowing in from rivers and rainfall and leaving through evaporation. This balance is changing as the world warms, causing many lakes to shrink.
People don’t need to look far to see what the future might hold. The nearby Aral Sea, straddling Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, was once one of the world’s largest lakes but has all but disappeared, devastated by a combination of human activities and the escalating climate crisis.
Over many thousands of years, the Caspian Sea has swung between highs and lows as temperatures fluctuated and ice sheets advanced and retreated. In the past few decades, however, the decline is accelerating.
Human activities play an important role, as countries build reservoirs and dams. The Caspian is fed by 130 rivers, although around 80% of the water comes from just one: the Volga, Europe’s longest river, which winds through central and southern Russia.
Russia has built 40 dams, with 18 more in development, according to Vali Kaleji, an expert on Central Asia and Caucasian Studies at the University of Tehran, reducing the flow of water entering the Caspian Sea.
But climate change is playing an increasingly significant role, increasing evaporation rates and fueling more erratic rainfall.
Caspian Sea water levels have been falling since the mid-1990s, but have sped up since 2005, dropping by about 5 feet, said Matthias Prange, an Earth systems modeler at the University of Bremen in Germany.
As the world warms further, levels are set “to drastically fall,” Prange told CNN. His research predicts declines of 8 to 18 meters (26 to 59 feet) by the end of the century, depending on how quickly the world cuts fossil fuel pollution.
Another study suggests drops of up to 30 meters (98 feet) are possible by 2100. Even under more optimistic global warming scenarios, the shallower, northern part of the Caspian Sea, mostly around Kazakhstan, is set to completely disappear, said Joy Singarayer, a paleoclimatology professor at the University of Reading, and the study’s co-author.
For Caspian Sea countries, this is a crisis. Fishing grounds would shrink, tourism would decline, and the shipping industry would suffer as vessels struggle to dock in shallow port cities like Aktau, the University of Tehran’s Kaleji said.
There would be geopolitical ramifications too. Five countries competing for diminishing resources could culminate “in a race to extract more water,” Singarayer said. It could also set up new conflicts over oil and gas reserves, if shifting coastlines push countries to make new claims.
The situation is already disastrous for the Caspian Sea’s unique wildlife. It’s home to hundreds of species, including the endangered wild sturgeon, the source of 90% of the world’s caviar.
The sea has been landlocked for at least 2 million years, its extreme isolation resulting in the “emergence of bizarre creatures such as very strange cockles,” Wesslingh told CNN.
But receding water is depleting oxygen levels in its depths, which “might wipe out the remaining survivors of millions of years of evolution,” he told CNN. It’s “a massive crisis that almost no one knows about.”
It’s a crisis too for Caspian seals, an endangered marine mammal found nowhere else on Earth. Their haul-out sites in the shallower northeastern Caspian Sea are shifting and disappearing, as the animals also struggle against pollution and overfishing.
Aerial surveys show huge reductions of seals, said Assel Baimukanova, a researcher at the Institute of Hydrobiology and Ecology in Kazakhstan.
Scientists counted 25,000 at one haul-out site on the Durnev Islands in the northeast Caspian Sea in 2009. “By the spring of 2020, we did not observe a single individual,” she told CNN.
There are few easy solutions to this crisis. The Caspian Sea is in a region that has experienced a lot of political instability, and is shared between five countries, each of which will experience its decline in different ways.
No one country is to blame, but if they fail to take collective action, there could be a repeat of the Aral Sea disaster, Kaleji said. There is no guarantee the Caspian “will return to a natural and normal cycle,” he added.
Rising concern about the Caspian’s fate comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on the region.
Next month, global leaders will gather in Azerbaijan’s coastal capital city Baku for COP29, the United Nations’ annual climate summit, where they will discuss climate action in the shadow of the oil rigs dotted across this part of the Caspian Sea.
In August, the country’s President Ilham Aliyev said the Caspian Sea’s decline was “catastrophic” and becoming an ecological disaster — but at the same time the country plans to expand its own production of the fossil fuels that are helping drive it.
Back in Kazakhstan, Sarsenbayev is trying to draw attention to the Caspian’s plight through beautiful, sweeping footage he posts on Instagram.
If the climate crisis and water over-extraction continue unabated, he fears “the Caspian Sea may face the fate of the Aral Sea.”
In Iran, Javanmardi, continues to photograph the Caspian coastline, documenting the polluted water, shrunken shores and desiccated sea beds, as well revealing the beauty that still exists and the connections people have to the sea.
He wants people to wake up to what’s disappearing.
“This is the biggest lake in the world,” he said, “all people should consider it as something important.”"
A La Niña winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/weather/la-nina-winter-forecast-climate/index.html,"A La Niña winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US
Follow:
Fall is in full swing, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially one that could feel considerably different than last year’s dominated by El Niño.
A weak La Niña is expected to develop ahead of the season and influence temperatures, precipitation, and by extension, even snow across the United States.
La Niña is a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. The effects on weather are most pronounced during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and have a much weaker influence in the summer.
Last winter was the warmest on record for the Lower 48 because it was dominated by La Niña’s counterpart El Niño in a world also warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
The prolonged warmth prevented many heavy snow events in the Northeast and Midwest and created a winter snow drought measured in feet of missing snow.
La Niña isn’t here yet, but has a 60% chance of emerging through November, according to the Climate Prediction Center. Once it arrives, it’ll stick around all winter and likely persist into at least early spring of next year.
La Niña or El Niño are never the only factors influencing weather in a given season or location, but emphasis is placed on them because they typically have an outsized effect on winter weather in the US — especially when they are strong.
While it’s still unclear just how strong La Niña will get, current forecasts favor a weaker one.
The strength of La Niña matters — the stronger it is the more of a “consistent” impact it can have on weather, according to Emily Becker, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami.
“A weaker event makes it more likely that other weather and climate phenomena could play the role of spoiler,” Becker wrote in NOAA’s latest La Niña/El Niño blog.
The latest forecast from the Climate Prediction Center – issued Thursday – shows many of the hallmarks of typical La Niña winters and is consistent with the center’s earlier forecasts. But experts are cautioning the season could be tumultuous at times.
This winter could be one filled with frequent weather changes from week-to-week rather than prolonged periods of more consistent weather, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the center’s operational prediction branch.
“In a warming world, we continue to see weather extremes manifest in the coldest months,” Michael Morgan, NOAA’s assistant secretary of commerce for observation and prediction, cautioned Thursday.
What could this winter look like?
No two La Niña winters are the same, but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common.
This is due to the behavior of the jet stream — essentially a river of air that storms flow through — which often shifts north during a La Niña winter. This typically shifts stormy weather out of the South and into parts of the northern US.
That’s almost exactly what the Climate Prediction Center’s winter forecast shows for December through February.
Large portions of the northern US are expected to end up wetter than normal this winter, especially the Pacific Northwest and Midwest. Wet weather will be crucial to combat ongoing dryness and drought in the Midwest.
It’s a complete flip from last winter’s pattern, which favored a wetter South and a drier North.
More precipitation than normal doesn’t guarantee there will be more snow. Temperatures still have to be chilly enough both above and at the surface for snow to fall and stick to the ground.
Weak La Niña events tend to allow for more snow in the Northeast, while snow is more limited during stronger La Niñas because warmer temperatures often creep farther up the East Coast.
If this year’s La Niña ends up rather weak, this outlook could shift. Still, the latest winter temperature forecasts from the center aren’t ideal for snow lovers in the Northeast.
The season is expected to be warmer than normal across almost the entire southern half of the US and much of the East. This could mean some winter storms in parts of the East end up wetter, rather than snowier. But with drier and warmer than normal conditions expected across the South, drought conditions could worsen throughout the season.
Parts of the Midwest, Plains and Rockies could end up with temperatures closer to normal this winter while cooler than normal conditions are expected from the Pacific Northwest to parts of the Dakotas.
The combination of wetter and cooler than normal conditions could potentially mean more snow for the Pacific Northwest, an area where a significant snowpack is crucial to tourism in the winter and the water supply for the warmer months.
Northern California is typically wetter during a La Niña winter, but the Climate Prediction Center’s forecast keeps the region near normal this season. La Niña had a hand in the extremely wet winter much of the state endured from December 2022 to February 2023 and during the wet winter before that.
Southern California is expected to be drier and warmer than average – typical for La Niña. It’s crucial the region gets a period of soaking rain in the next few months; wet weather is needed to shut down wildfire season. Without enough rain, fires could continue to burn through the overabundance of fire fuels like grasses or brush available this year."
The system that moves water around the Earth is off balance for the first time in human history,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/climate/global-water-cycle-off-balance-food-production/index.html,"The system that moves water around the Earth is off balance for the first time in human history

Humanity has thrown the global water cycle off balance “for the first time in human history,” fueling a growing water disaster that will wreak havoc on economies, food production and lives, according to a landmark new report.
Decades of destructive land use and water mismanagement have collided with the human-caused climate crisis to put “unprecedented stress” on the global water cycle, said the report published Wednesday by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water, a group of international leaders and experts.
The water cycle refers to the complex system by which water moves around the Earth. Water evaporates from the ground — including from lakes, rivers and plants — and rises into the atmosphere, forming large rivers of water vapor able to travel long distances, before cooling, condensing and eventually falling back to the ground as rain or snow.
Disruptions to the water cycle are already causing suffering. Nearly 3 billion people face water scarcity. Crops are shriveling and cities are sinking as the groundwater beneath them dries out.
The consequences will be even more catastrophic without urgent action. The water crisis threatens more than 50% of global food production and risks shaving an average of 8% off countries’ GDPs by 2050, with much higher losses of up to 15% projected in low-income countries, the report found.
“For the first time in human history, we are pushing the global water cycle out of balance,” said Johan Rockström, co-chair of the Global Commission on the Economics of Water and a report author. “Precipitation, the source of all freshwater, can no longer be relied upon.”
The report differentiates between “blue water,” the liquid water in lakes, rivers and aquifers, and “green water,” the moisture stored in soils and plants.
While the supply of green water has long been overlooked, it is just as important to the water cycle, the report says, as it returns to the atmosphere when plants release water vapor, generating about half of all rainfall over land.
Disruptions to the water cycle are “deeply intertwined” with climate change, the report found.
A stable supply of green water is vital for supporting vegetation that can store planet-heating carbon. But the damage humans inflict, including destroying wetlands and tearing down forests, is depleting these carbon sinks and accelerating global warming. In turn, climate change-fueled heat is drying out landscapes, reducing moisture and increasing fire risk.
The crisis is made more urgent by the huge need for water. The report calculates that, on average, people need a minimum of about 4,000 liters (just over 1,000 gallons) a day to lead a “dignified life,” far above the 50 to 100 liters the United Nations says is needed for basic needs, and more than most regions will be able to provide from local sources.
Richard Allan, a climate science professor at Reading University, England, said the report “paints a grim picture of human-caused disruption to the global water cycle, the most precious natural resource that ultimately sustains our livelihoods.”
Human activities “are altering the fabric of our land and the air above which is warming the climate, intensifying both wet and dry extremes, and sending wind and rainfall patterns out of kilter,” added Allan, who was not involved in the report.
The crisis can only be addressed through better management of natural resources and massive cuts in planet-heating pollution, he told CNN.
The report’s authors say world governments must recognize the water cycle as a “common good” and address it collectively. Countries are dependent on each other, not only through lakes and rivers that span borders, but also because of water in the atmosphere, which can travel huge distances — meaning decisions made in one country can disrupt rainfall in another.
The report calls for a “fundamental regearing of where water sits in economies,” including better pricing to discourage wastefulness and the tendency to plant water-thirsty crops and facilities, such as data centers, in water-stressed regions.
“The global water crisis is a tragedy but is also an opportunity to transform the economics of water,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director general of the World Trade Organization and a co-chair of the commission that published the report. Valuing water properly is essential, she added, “so as to recognize its scarcity and the many benefits it delivers.”"

A dramatic pattern shift is bringing the chilliest air since spring to millions of people in the central and eastern United States, making areas that have struggled so far to shed lingering warmth feel more like November than October.
Extended periods of fall chill have been hard to come by for much of the country since the season began last month. But the combination of an expansive cold front and an upcoming surge of cold, Canadian air, will change that and temperatures could drop to 10 to 15 degrees below average by midweek.
As of Tuesday morning, more than 60 million people from the Plains to the Appalachians and Northeast are under some sort of frost or freeze alert as temperatures drop.
The first aspect of this cooldown — a far-reaching cold front — began over the weekend. This cold front swept from the north-central US through the eastern half of the US Monday, ushering in a true autumn chill for some along the way. Even chillier air from Canada will get pushed much farther south throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.
Tuesday could be the coldest day of the week in Chicago, where the high temperature could struggle to reach 50. Before Monday’s high of 57, Chicago hadn’t recorded a high in the 50s since April.
Temperatures will drop again on Wednesday for many areas outside the Midwest. Wednesday is likely to be the coolest day since spring for millions, and in many locations, it’ll feel more like late November than October.
“Truly fall-like weather is forecast … through the start of the weekend” farther south, the National Weather Service in Atlanta said Monday.
The high temperature in Washington, DC, on Wednesday could top out in the mid-50s — 10 to 15 degrees lower than normal for mid-October.
Atlanta could struggle to break into the low 60s on Wednesday and remain in the 60s through Friday. The city hasn’t had a high temperature reading below 70 degrees since May and typically tops out around 75 degrees this time of year.
Wednesday will also be the chilliest day of the week for large portions of the Northeast, with highs in the 40s and 50s for many. With daytime temperatures this chilly, it leaves room for overnight temperatures to possibly dip below freezing. Given the chill, a few snow flurries could dust the highest elevations of West Virginia to New York and New England Tuesday night.
“Frost and freeze conditions are probable for several nights and in many areas this week,” the National Weather Service in State College, Pennsylvania, warned Monday.
Frost and freeze alerts are active for millions this week and more could be issued in the coming days.
Freezing conditions can kill plants that are left unprotected from the cold or end the growing season for some regional staples. These conditions are also dangerous for anyone without access to adequate heating.
Freezing or-near freezing low temperatures are possible each night from Tuesday through Thursday in western North Carolina, which was devastated by Helene late last month.
Temperatures will ease back to more typical October conditions late this week in much of the central US and Northeast. The chill will linger through at least Friday for areas farther south like the southern Appalachians and the Southeast.
By Saturday, more seasonable highs in the 70s and 80s will return for the Southeast while 60s and 70s will be common north into the Midwest and parts of the Northeast."

(CNN) — Striking images from the Sahara Desert show large lakes etched into rolling sand dunes after one of the most arid, barren places in the world was hit with its first floods in decades.
The Sahara does experience rain, but usually just a few inches a year and rarely in late summer. Over two days in September, however, intense rain fell in parts of the desert in southeast Morocco, after a low pressure system pushed across northwestern Sahara.
Preliminary NASA satellite data showed nearly 8 inches of rain in some parts of the region.
Errachidia, a desert city in southeast Morocco, recorded nearly 3 inches of rainfall, most of it across just two days last month. That’s more than four times the normal rainfall for the whole month of September, and equates to more than half a year’s worth for this area.
“It’s been 30 to 50 years since we’ve had this much rain in such a short space of time,’ Houssine Youabeb from Morocco’s meteorology agency told AP last week.
As the rain flowed over the desert terrain, it created a new, watery landscape amid the palm trees and scrubby flora.
Some of the most dramatic images are from the desert town of Merzouga, where the rare deluge carved new lakes into the sand dunes.
The reflections of the town’s palm trees now shimmer across the expanse of a new lagoon, framed by steep sand dunes.
The rain also filled lakes that are normally dry, such as one in Iriqui National Park, Morocco’s largest national park. NASA satellite images from the region, using false color to better highlight the floodwaters, show newly-formed lakes across swaths of the northwest Sahara.
While much of the rain fell on sparsely-populated remote areas, some fell on Morocco’s towns and villages causing deadly flooding last month, which killed more than a dozen people.
The Sahara is the world’s largest non-polar desert, stretching across 3.6 million square miles. Satellite images from September showed huge swaths of it carpeted in green as storms pushed further north than usual, a phenomenon some studies have linked to human-caused climate change.
More extreme rainfall events could be expected in the Sahara in the future, according to recent research, as fossil fuel pollution continues to heat up the planet and disrupt the water cycle.

Monster storms Milton and Helene prove climate change is a national security issue,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/climate-change-national-security-issue/index.html,"Monster storms Milton and Helene prove climate change is a national security issue

Editor’s Note 10/23/24: Since this story was first published, officials in Buncombe County, North Carolina, home to Asheville, have reported they overcounted the death toll in their region by as many as 30. Some of the death toll figures in this story are no longer accurate.
The impact of two catastrophic hurricanes in the last two weeks has underlined that rapid climate change is a threat that can do far more damage to American lives than traditional antagonists such as terrorists and authoritarian states.
The monster Hurricane Milton has left parts of Florida reeling and climate scientists are in no doubt that the strength of such storms is increased by rapidly warming oceans.
This comes two weeks after Hurricane Helene significantly damaged communities like Asheville, North Carolina, hundreds of miles inland, that were seemingly immunized from the worst effects of climate change. Helene killed at least 232 people.
Treating climate change as a national security problem is not a liberal position but a hardheaded realist one. Indeed, the Pentagon has explicitly said it is and “elevated” it up the lists of threats facing the US. Three years ago, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin could not have been clearer, “We face all kinds of threats in our line of work, but few of them truly deserve to be called existential. The climate crisis does.”
Key US Navy bases in low-lying areas like Norfolk and Virginia Beach in Virginia are threatened by the rising waters caused by climate change, and the Pentagon is working to mitigate its impact.
It’s also triggering an exodus of climate refugees who add to the chaos of conflicts around the world, for instance, in Sudan, where one of the most lethal wars on the planet today is taking place.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had a broader conception of American national security than its present, more narrow conception of freedom from attack from outside forces, according to a recent book by the historian Peter Roady, titled “The Contest Over National Security.”
Roosevelt saw national security as securing the lives of all American citizens, which is why Social Security — a program that Roosevelt signed into law in 1935 — is called Social Security rather than, say, Social Welfare. Today, Social Security is one of the most popular US government programs.
As the Nazis were conquering great swaths of Europe on January 6, 1941, Roosevelt spoke about his broad view of national security during his State of the Union address, emphasizing the need for “freedom from want–which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world.”
It was the Cold War and competition with the Soviet Union that produced a change in how national security was conceptualized, and it took on its present narrower meaning of freedom from an attack by a competitor, according to Roady.
This framing of national security also endured after the 9/11 attacks. The George W. Bush administration’s 2002 national security strategy said, “We will defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants … Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government.”
Now, reframing what constitutes national security should be a top priority and it’s not just climate change that represents an existential threat.  Consider that the Covid-19 pandemic killed around the same number of Americans — 1.2 million — that had died in every war since the American Revolution.
Politicians are under pressure to get serious about planning for the next pandemic enabled by the ease of global travel. According to the non-partisan COVID Crisis Group, which released a detailed report last year, the US remains quite unprepared for the next pandemic.
The devastating impacts of this fall’s hurricanes may also cause American politicians to start seriously planning to mitigate the risks from climate change by, for instance, restricting new construction in flood zones.
After Hurricane Milton, Americans should ask themselves: Are they safer now from threats like climate change and pandemics? And if not, isn’t it time for a real discussion of what truly constitutes national security to begin?"

The exceptionally warm water of the Gulf of Mexico that supercharged deadly Helene last month was made up to 500 times more likely by human-caused climate change, which also ramped up the hurricane’s wind and rain, according to a new scientific analysis.
Helene, which made landfall in Florida as a deadly Category 4 hurricane at the end of September, carved a 500-mile path of destruction across six states, causing catastrophic flooding and killing more than 230 people.
Warm oceans provide a huge source of energy for storms to strengthen and grow, and the water Helene passed over before making landfall was around 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above average.
These ultra-warm ocean temperatures were made between 200 and 500 times more likely by climate change, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, according to the World Weather Attribution, a network of scientists that calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events using real world data and climate models.
Climate change also worsened the extreme wind and torrential rain unleashed by Helene, making wind speeds on the Florida coast 11% more intense and increasing rainfall by about 10%, according to the analysis published Wednesday.
This additional rainfall translated to “massive damages,” the study found. It created “apocalyptic scenes,” from Florida to the Southern Appalachians, said Ben Clarke, a study author and researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute.
Hurricanes as intense as Helene are now about 2.5 times more likely in the region, the study found. Where they were once expected every 130 years on average, they can now be expected about once every 53 years.
“Climate change is a total game-changer for hurricanes like Helene,” Clarke said, adding, “if humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more destructive hurricanes.”
Wednesday’s study comes as Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall as a major hurricane on Florida’s Gulf Coast, causing disastrous impacts less than two weeks after Helene.
“The heat that human activities are adding to the atmosphere and oceans is like steroids for hurricanes,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, a study author and chief meteorologist at nonprofit research group Climate Central.
More than 90% of global warming over the past several decades has taken place in oceans. Hurricanes are taking full advantage of that extra energy. Rapid intensification, when a hurricane’s wind speed increases by at least 35 mph within 24 hours, has now become more common due to climate change.
Helene rapidly intensified from a Category 2 to a Category﻿ 4 hurricane just a few hours before slamming into Florida’s Big Bend region at the end of September.
On Monday, Hurricane Milton became one of the most rapidly intensifying storms on record as it exploded into a Category 5 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico.
The impacts of these supercharged storms are extensive. Western North Carolina, hundreds of miles from the coast, experienced the deadliest impacts of Helene, with more than 100 people losing their lives.
“Helene is a tragic reminder that it is not just coastal areas that are vulnerable,” said Gabriel Vecchi, co-author of the study and professor of geosciences at Princeton University. “Wetter and stronger storms pose a growing threat far inland.”
Wednesday’s report follows two earlier climate analyses published last week, which also concluded fossil fuel pollution worsened Helene’s rainfall, exacerbating what would have already been a disastrous situation.
Friederike Otto, WWA lead and senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said future hurricane impacts could still be minimized if the world rapidly replaces fossil fuels with renewable energy.
“Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene,” Otto said, adding, “we need leaders who are honest about the fact that addressing climate change is inevitable if human rights are to count for something, and ensuring future generations do not have to live in a world of climate chaos.”

You can now see climate risk data when shopping for a home on Zillow
Follow:
Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc across the southeastern United States in late September, causing billions of dollars in property damage. This week, another storm, Hurricane Milton, is expected to make landfall in Florida, causing even more destruction.
As intensifying natural disasters threaten growing swaths of the country, assessing an area’s climate risk has become an essential part of shopping for a new home for many Americans. According to a recent Zillow survey, more than 4 out of 5 prospective homebuyers consider climate risks when they shop.
Now, in a feature launched last month, Zillow will show how vulnerable properties for sale might be to extreme climate events.
In partnership with First Street, a climate modeling company, the climate data shared by Zillow is divided into five categories: flood, wildfire, wind, heat and air quality. Home shoppers can explore climate risk data on Zillow’s site through color-coded maps or on individual listings. The feature not only shows a home’s risks today, but it also estimates a home’s climate risks 15 years and 30 years into the future, which are the typical lengths of fixed mortgages.
In addition, Zillow said it is the only platform to offer tailored insurance recommendations alongside the risk information.
“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement. “As concerns about flooding, extreme temperatures and wildfires grow — and what that might mean for future insurance costs — this tool also helps agents inform their clients in discussing climate risk, insurance and long-term affordability.”
CoreLogic, a data analytics firm, estimates that the insured losses from flooding caused by Hurricane Helene will be between $6 billion and $11 billion, while the uninsured flood losses are estimated to be between $20 million and $30 million.
A growing number of home listings come with major climate risk compared to homes listed for sale five years ago, according to an August Zillow analysis. Across all new listings on the website in August, 55% carry a risk of extreme heat and one-third are at risk of extreme wind exposure. Nearly 17% of homes for sale are at major wildfire risk, 13% have an air quality risk and 13% are at risk of flooding.

Scientists looked at images from space to see how fast Antarctica is turning green. Here’s what they found,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/climate/antarctica-greening-vegetation-satellite-images/index.html,"Scientists looked at images from space to see how fast Antarctica is turning green. Here’s what they found

Parts of icy Antarctica are turning green with plant life at an alarming rate as the region is gripped by extreme heat events, according to new research, sparking concerns about the changing landscape on this vast continent.
Scientists used satellite imagery and data to analyze vegetation levels on the Antarctic Peninsula, a long mountain chain that points north to the tip of South America, and which has been warming much faster than the global average.
They found plant life — mostly mosses — had increased in this harsh environment more than 10-fold over the past four decades, according to the study by scientists at the universities of Exeter and Hertfordshire in England, and the British Antarctic Survey, published Friday in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Vegetation covered less than 0.4 square miles of the Antarctic Peninsula in 1986 but had reached almost 5 square miles by 2021, the study found. The rate at which the region has been greening over nearly four decades has also been speeding up, accelerating by more than 30% between 2016 and 2021.
While the landscape is still almost entirely snow, ice and rock, this small, green area has grown dramatically since the mid 1980s, said Thomas Roland, a study author and environmental scientist at the University of Exeter.
“Our findings confirm that the influence of anthropogenic climate change has no limit in its reach,” Roland told CNN. “Even on the Antarctic Peninsula – this most extreme, remote and isolated ‘wilderness’ region – the landscape is changing, and these effects are visible from space.”
Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, has recently been gripped by extreme heat events.
This summer, parts of the continent experienced a record-breaking heat wave with temperatures climbing up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal from mid-July.
In March 2022, temperatures in some parts of the continent reached up to 70 degrees above normal, the most extreme temperature departures ever recorded in this part of the planet.
As fossil fuel pollution continues to heat up the world, Antarctica will keep on warming and this greening is only likely to accelerate, the scientists predict.
The more the peninsula greens, the more soil will form and the more likely the region will become more favorable for invasive species, potentially threatening native wildlife.
“Seeds, spores and plant fragments can readily find their way to the Antarctic Peninsula on the boots or equipment of tourists and researchers, or via more ‘traditional’ routes associated with migrating birds and the wind – and so the risk here is clear,” he said.
The greening could also reduce the peninsula’s ability to reflect solar radiation back into space, because darker surfaces absorb more heat.
These impacts would likely only be local, but could help further accelerate the growth of plant life as the climate continues to warm, said one of the authors, Olly Bartlett, a senior lecturer in remote sensing and geography at the University of Hertfordshire.
“This iconic landscape could be changed forever,” he said.
Matthew Davey, associate professor of physiological ecology at the Scottish Association for Marine Science, and an expert on polar plant and microbe ecology, told CNN the study was “an important progression” for understanding plant life on Antarctica.
There could even be more vegetation than identified, said Davey, who was not involved in the research. The methods used by the scientists would mainly detect larger, greener moss fields, he said. “But we know that there are also large areas of lichens, grass and green and red snow algae that will also contribute to the vegetation area in Antarctica.”
While the actual area increase of plant life is small, he added, the percentage rise is dramatic and it shows “the trend that vegetation is spreading, albeit slowly, in Antarctica.”
The next stage for the scientists will be to study how plants colonize recently exposed bare land as Antarctica’s glaciers retreat further.

Heating your home will cost more again this winter
Follow:
Get ready to bundle up this winter — inside your home.
Home heating expenses in the US are expected to jump 10.5%, on average, due in part to colder temperatures forecast for the Northeast and Midwest, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.
Consumers who heat with electricity will be hit the hardest, with their costs projected to rise 13.6% to $1,208 for the winter season, the association found. The expense of maintaining and upgrading the electric grid is driving up costs, particularly in the West, where fires have ravaged the grid and electric heating costs could soar nearly 23%.
The price tag for heating with propane will rise 7.3% to $1,442 this winter, while natural gas users will see a 7.2% increase to $644. Natural gas prices have stabilized but are expected to rise over the winter as US exports increase, said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director.
But those who heat with oil will catch somewhat of a break after a pricey heating season last year, with costs expected to rise only 6.1% to $1,963 this winter. A weak oil market has led to a drop in prices.
While many people may think that climate change would produce warmer winters, that’s not necessarily the case, Wolfe said. Extreme cold can still occur even if winters warm overall, according to scientists.
“It will be another difficult winter, coming after a difficult summer,” he told CNN.“So many families are just finishing paying their summer cooling bills.”
Unable to afford the bills
A growing number of people are falling behind on their utility bills, the association found. Some 21 million households owed a total of $13.5 billion on their electric bills in June, up from 20.4 million owing $12.5 billion a year earlier.
The drop in natural gas prices has helped decrease the total amount owed to $6.1 billion in June, compared to $7.4 billion a year earlier. But some 17.4 million households — or more than one in five — were in arrears, up from 15.2 million.
What’s more, utility shutoffs are projected to have increased to 3.8 million households this past fiscal year, which ended September 30, up from 3.5 million the prior year, Wolfe said.
Part of the reason more people are struggling to pay their bills is because there is less federal assistance available, he said. Congress only provided $4.1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, this past fiscal year, down from $6 billion the prior fiscal year.
The association has asked lawmakers to provide $6.1 billion for the coming fiscal year, as well as an additional $1 billion for emergency assistance.
“In the short term, we need to support the millions of families across the country who are struggling to keep up with monthly utility payments,” he said in a statement.

"Motorsport is trying to reach Net Zero. Could fuels like this, made from air and water, help accelerate the journey?",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/sport/carbon-neutral-fuel-zero-motorsport-f1-spt-intl/index.html,"Motorsport is trying to reach Net Zero. Could fuels like this, made from air and water, help accelerate the journey?
Follow:
As the climate crisis worsens, Formula One is looking for ways to pollute less planet-heating carbon and become more sustainable.
Like many other sports, Formula One has committed to achieving net-zero by 2030, meaning that those behind it pledge to dramatically reduce its carbon pollution and remove from the atmosphere any that remains.
In a step toward that goal, F1 teams will be required to run on 100% sustainable fuels from 2026 onwards. F1 cars already use 10% ethanol biofuel.
As fans have been familiarizing themselves with terms such as “carbon neutral” over the past few years and getting to grips with what it means for the highly-polluting motorsport’s future, one type of fuel could have the potential to change the game entirely: synthetic fuel.
Synthetic fuels aim to be carbon neutral, and those used in racing are made by combining carbon and hydrogen — to make hydrocarbons — just like gasoline used in cars today. The difference is, instead of using oil, which pollutes and heats the planet, the carbon in synthetic fuels is sucked from the air with filters, while the hydrogen comes from water using the process of electrolysis, powered with renewable energy sources like wind and solar. One company using that process is Zero Petroleum.
Zero is producing fossil-free replicas of the base materials used in gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. Vehicles can then run on these fuels without any modifications.
While Zero and synthetic fuels as a whole are stirring up a lot of excitement in motorsport, the reality is we’re not likely to see them in F1, NASCAR or IndyCar any time soon.
The product is incredibly pricey – CNN Sport was told at the company’s recent Fuel Reinvented event in Bicester, England, that it was around four times more expensive than petrol – which naturally hinders the ability to make it widely available for use in motorsport.
Electrolysis of water using renewable energy produces what is known as green hydrogen, but the process is expensive and requires huge amounts of renewable energy. According to BloombergNEF, the average production cost for green hydrogen in 2023 was $6.40 per kilogram. In comparison, gray hydrogen – which is made from fossil fuels – was $2.14 per kg.
Hydrogen Insight reported in 2023 that the first synthetic fuel made from green hydrogen and CO2 at German car manufacturer Porsche’s Haru Oni pilot project in Southern Chile was over 100 times more expensive than petrol.
Zero, however, believes that the price point will come down over the next few years as the company grows and ramps up its production levels. Bloomberg’s research suggests that the green hydrogen price could drop below its gray counterpart by the end of the current decade.
“These fuels will be produced in huge quantities eventually, in a few decades,” Zero founder Paddy Lowe told CNN at the event in July. “I believe all fuels will be made in this way, and we won’t be using fossil fuels anymore at all. So that’s a very, very exciting future.”
F1 pedigree
Lowe is a former motorsport engineer who boasts a wealth of title-winning experience in F1 between 1987 and 2019, serving as Chief Technical Officer at Williams, Technical Director with McLaren and Executive Director, Technical, at Mercedes.
He helped to develop seven Drivers’ World Championship-winning cars; Nigel Mansell, Nico Rosberg, Mika Häkkinen (twice) and Lewis Hamilton (three times) each claimed the sport’s ultimate prize with Lowe on the team. He also has five Constructors’ Championships to his name.
A self-professed “petrolhead,” the 62-year-old left the sport in 2019 to start Zero and told CNN about his excitement at being part of motorsport’s sustainability movement.
“We’re here today running lots of cars, making lots of noise, burning off fuel,” he said at the Fuel Reinvented event. “I love energy, and Formula One is a sport of high energy. The problem with energy these days is it needs to be made sustainable. That’s what we all know.
“I’ve just been very excited to become part of a new industry that will achieve that. And that’s a really nice counterbalance to my entire career in Formula One.”
Zero may be in its relatively early stages – the company has only been in existence for four years and Plant Zero.1 in Bicester only opened its doors in 2023, but F1 has helped to build its foundations. Alongside Lowe, there are multiple former F1 engineers on the team, while 1996 world champion Damon Hill is on board as an investor. Ahead of the 2024 F1 season, Zero became an official partner of the Kick Sauber team.
Sauber drivers Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu put Zero’s product to the test at the Fuel Reinvented event, taking a 1967 Lamborghini Miura and a 2024 Huracán Sterrato around a track.
Diehard petrolheads and motorsport fans will be pleased to know that the fuel did nothing to affect the power or noise of the engines in contrast to quieter electric racing cars; the supercars blitzed around the track with the typical roar that fans have come to expect.
Zero continued its foray into motorsport in April, linking up with 2B Autosport to become the first synthetic fuel partner in rally car racing. It also has deals outside of sport, including a partnership with the British Royal Air Force that saw both parties awarded a Guinness World Record for the world’s first successful flight using only synthetic fuel.
Zero could perhaps seek to emulate P1 Fuels, a synthetic fuel firm that is already an established player in the industry. The German company’s Eco100Pro product can be legally sold at US and European fuel stations and already supplies fuel to the World Rally Championship and World Karting Championship.
Other racing competitions are also already entering this space. Porsche announced this year that the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup – a one-make stock car series – would run exclusively on synthetic fuels produced at the Haru Oni plant. However, the fuels are described as only “potentially near-carbon-neutral” by the company.
When the fuel regulations hit F1 in 2026, it will be working in collaboration with Aramco, a Saudi state-owned petroleum and natural gas giant and a global partner of F1, which will see sustainable fuels used in motorsport on the biggest scale so far.
Is F1 losing the race to Net Zero?
Lowe welcomes motorsport’s approach to sustainability and praised F1’s 2026 fuel regulations, calling the sport a “great platform for developing new technology, improving it and bringing it to general adoption.” But as the example-setting pinnacle of motorsport with significant influence over much of the racing world, how close is F1 to making its net zero target a reality?
In the future, F1 says it will use carbon neutral fuels like the ones Zero produces. Per the sport, they will be created from a “a combination of non-food bio sources, genuine waste sources, or carbon extracted from the air” and will be “drop-in” fuels that do not require the engine or fuel system to be adapted.
In 2023, cars in the junior Formula 2 and Formula 3 championships began using a 55% sustainable fuel mix.
There are perceived moral issues over F1’s partnership with Aramco. The company has been criticized in the past for “greenwashing,” given that the majority of its production is fossil fuels.
In addition, some experts suggest that electric power, a significantly cheaper alternative to synthetic fuels, would be a much more efficient way of decarbonizing the sport than synthetic fuel. But there are obstacles.
Former International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Jean Todt said in 2021 that it was “simply not possible” for the championship to go all-electric in the near future due to long race distances that electric power would not have the capacity for without recharging.
Furthermore, a different series, Formula E, currently holds the exclusive rights to a fully-electric single seater competition until 2039. And needless to say, F1 may face an open rebellion over the lack of engine sound from its fans, many of whom still long for the screech of the V8 units that were replaced in 2014 at the start of the turbo-hybrid era.
Though changing the way that the cars are powered is undoubtedly a positive step, the sport will need to make further drastic changes if it is to hit its target by 2030. Fuel makes up less than 1% of F1’s overall carbon footprint, while logistics – such as transporting cars, parts and equipment from country to country between races – account for 49%. With the F1 calendar expanding to a record 24 races this year, reducing emissions – and quickly – will be a huge challenge.
F1 is aiming to use sustainable aviation fuel and increase the use of sea freight to help bring emissions down. It also used a fleet of 18 new trucks fueled by a biofuel at nine European race weekends in 2023.
According to F1’s latest impact report, the sport still has a long way to go. Emissions in 2022 were down by 13% from 2018, but still well away from its target of reducing emissions by 50% by 2030, with the remainder being mitigated through carbon offsetting – taking separate measures, like planting trees, a somewhat controversial method of compensating for CO2 being added to the atmosphere.
F1 has certainly made some steps in the right direction but it remains to be seen whether it can achieve its goals before the checkered flag."
"Hurricanes have changed. The way we prepare for them should, too.",https://www.cnn.com/weather/hurricanes-global-warming-preparation-climate/index.html,"Hurricanes have changed. The way we prepare for them should, too.
Follow:
Hurricanes aren’t what they used to be. As the planet warms, they are morphing into something more dangerous — intensifying faster, producing more rainfall and generating bigger storm surge.
To protect ourselves from these increasing threats, researchers say hurricane preparedness and the way people perceive storms need to proactively change, as well.
“We want to make sure that people are not being complacent, (know) that these storms are intensifying more because of climate change, and that they are taking that seriously,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, director of public affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told CNN.
Evacuate or stay put?
More than 90% of global warming over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans. Hurricanes are taking full advantage of the additional energy, getting stronger faster – and sometimes right before landfall.
Rapid intensification is giving people little to no time to evacuate; officials and coastal residents who may have been expecting a Category 1 hurricane when they went to bed might wake up to a Category 3.
Several hurricanes in the past few years, including Hurricane Ian, which devastated the southwest Florida coastline.
Emergency managers may not order evacuations because hurricanes are rapidly intensifying after the evacuation window has closed, said Samantha Montano, a disaster researcher at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.
More often now, coastal residents will find themselves sheltering at home.
“We’ve not necessarily put the resources and time into figuring out the most effective way of priming the public to understand what sheltering in place for a potentially major hurricane actually looks like,” Montano told CNN.
That means having enough food and water for an extended period in the event of power outages. It may also mean having a backup generator as well as a solar charger for your phone if you can afford it, Montano added.
Prepare for more than just a hurricane
Temperatures soared in Texas after Hurricane Beryl made landfall this summer. The heat index shot to more than 100 degrees while roughly 2.2 million customers didn’t have power, and importantly, air conditioning.
Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with people suffering from heat illness.
Rethinking preparedness plans that consider other extreme disasters require “different layers of decision- making,” said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at Columbia University’s Climate School. Prepare as if you’ll get stuck in one place longer than anticipated, Kruczkiewicz said.
Stock up on non-perishable food and make sure it’s stored in a place that isn’t at risk of flooding. Make sure you have extra essentials, too, and a first-aid kit.
“This expectation that we’ve kind of historically had in the US that it’ll be no more than 72 hours until help comes is not necessarily the case anymore,” Montano said. “So, people need to make sure that they have, to the best of their ability, as many supplies as possible.”
Finally, know where officials are setting up shelters in your community. These shelters could provide necessities to survive, including air conditioning, food and a safe place to sleep.
Respect low categories
Hurricane categories are based on the storm’s wind speed and don’t say anything about its storm surge or flood risk.
“The type of impact that we’re seeing, even if we talk about a Category 1, is different now,” Kruczkiewicz said, noting that Category 1 storms now carry intense rainfall and can also generate widespread storm surge.
Individuals need to dismantle their “perception and pride, thinking we could handle it” when the storm is a low category, he added.
“The actions (we can take) may still be appropriate, but they may have to be enhanced in different ways,” Kruczkiewicz said.
Rethink where you’re getting info from
With many different sources of news and information, “decentralizing and democratizing information is important,” Njoki Mwarumba, assistant professor of emergency management at SUNY Empire State University, “but it has to be reliable.”
In doing so, Kruczkiewicz said go beyond and ask yourself the following questions: “Why am I using this data source? Maybe I use my iPhone app for day-to-day weather but is that really the best app when I’m making life- or- death decisions for my family on how to prepare?”
Experts say it is imperative for people to listen to local emergency managers, and monitor weather forecast and information coming from the National Hurricane Center or National Weather Service.
“Know your source,” Kruczkiewicz said. “And take that source very seriously.”"
Helene forecast to rapidly intensify and hit Florida as a major hurricane,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/weather/helene-tropical-storm-hurricane-forecast-climate/index.html,"Helene forecast to rapidly intensify and hit Florida as a major hurricane
Follow:
An area of thunderstorms in the Caribbean is expected to develop into Hurricane Helene and rapidly intensify over the exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico before slamming into the United States’ Gulf Coast later this week as a major hurricane.
The storm has not formed yet but is expected to soon, so the National Hurricane Center has dubbed it Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine to warn of its imminent threat.
“Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the system is forecast to become a hurricane on Wednesday and continue strengthening on Thursday as it moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico,” the hurricane center’s 8 p.m. advisory said.
The system has a 90% chance of forming into a hurricane in the next 48 hours, according to the center.
Hurricane and tropical storm watches are in effect for parts of Mexico and Cuba. A tropical storm watch was raised Monday afternoon for Florida’s Dry Tortugas and part of the Keys. Additional alerts will be issued for the US in the coming days, with a potential landfall in Florida expected perhaps as soon Thursday evening.
Florida wasted no time getting preparations underway. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm for 41 the state’s 67 counties, according to a Monday press release. The move helps to expedite preparations and coordination between the state and local governments.
Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine is a disorganized mass of showers and thunderstorms churning in the far western Caribbean Sea. This stormy weather will drop potentially flooding rainfall over portions of Central America, Mexico, Cuba and Jamaica as it tries to organize into a tropical system.
While its exact track and strength could change, Helene will track north over the extremely warm waters into the Gulf of Mexico which will likely supercharge it on its collision course with the US Gulf Coast.
The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Helene to rapidly intensify and eventually become a Category 3 hurricane over a record-warm Gulf of Mexico – a feat becoming more likely as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.
Strong, potentially damaging winds and storm surge are likely near where the system ultimately comes ashore. The system will also churn up seas in the Gulf and could produce rough surf and dangerous rip currents for much of the basin, especially later this week.
The National Hurricane Center is showing a landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region, but anyone from Florida’s Gulf Coast to eastern Louisiana should be on alert this week.
Confidence in the system’s exact track will increase after it forms, since forecast models struggle to accurately pinpoint where it could go without a center to lock onto.
Ensemble forecast models – groupings of many model runs initiated with slight differences to show a wide range of outcomes – are focusing on the eastern Gulf Coast as the area most likely for a landfall later this week. When ensemble tracks bunch closer together it means there’s more confidence in the track.
There’s a closer grouping with this storm along the eastern Gulf Coast, but given it hasn’t formed yet it’s not a guarantee.
Tampa General Hospital began erecting a 10-foot-high flood barrier around the facility Monday because of the chance for storm surge and shifts in the storm’s track with little time to prepare. The level one trauma center’s location next to Hillsborough Bay makes it extremely storm surge prone.
It takes three days for a 60 person team to fully erect the barrier to encase the hospital and work will continue “unless we see a forecast favorable enough to stop,” Dustin Pasteur, the vice president of facilities and construction at the hospital said. “I just couldn’t afford to lose a day waiting.”
Regardless of its exact track, heavy rainfall is possible for much of the Southeast starting around midweek. A level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain is in place for much of Florida, Georgia, Alabama and parts of the Carolinas Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
The system’s danger won’t end after landfall either. Helene could bring strong winds and torrential rainfall to much of Georgia and the Carolinas by Friday. This could lead to dangerous flooding and significant power outages.
Another impactful storm for the US and Florida
Helene is forecast to become the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the US this year. The three others all rapidly intensified before striking the US as hurricanes: Beryl, Debby and Francine.
The last time four or more hurricanes hit the US in one season was the devastating 2020 season.
Despite the rash of impactful storms, if Helene manages to landfall as a Category 3 it would be the first major hurricane to do so in the US since Idalia slammed into Florida’s Big Bend last August.
Helene would continue a brutal stretch for the Sunshine State. Helene is forecast to be the fifth hurricane to slam Florida since 2022. The repeated blows have pushed the insurance market in the state to the brink, with insurers pulling out of the state because of the increasing risk of extreme weather due to climate change.

President Joe Biden will speak at Climate Week NYC on Tuesday, touting his administration’s vast climate agenda and drawing contrasts between Democratic action and Republicans who voted against his 2022 climate law, according to a White House official.
Biden will appear at the Bloomberg Global Business forum, according to the official, where he’ll speak about his work to lower planet-warming pollution in the US and create clean energy jobs while saving Americans money with energy tax subsidies. Details on Biden’s speech were shared first with CNN.
“The President will highlight how his Administration has delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda ever and restored America’s climate leadership around the world,” the White House official said in an email statement.
Vice President Kamala Harris is not on the official White House schedule to appear at climate week, which is an annual event in New York that encourages global climate action and takes place alongside the United Nations General Assembly, where global leaders will gather.
While there, in the final weeks of a neck-and-neck race for the White House between Harris and former President Donald Trump, Biden will draw a sharp contrast between Democrats and Republicans on energy and climate. The president will point out that Republicans voted unanimously against his climate bill, and many voted against Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.
Despite Republican opposition to the 2022 climate bill, CNN recently reported the vast majority of the hundreds of billions of dollars of announced investments has so far gone to Republican congressional districts. Many House Republicans are seeing their districts awash in jobs and cash as companies use clean energy tax credits to construct factories to build electric vehicles and their batteries, and as massive wind, solar, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects come online.
Americans are also taking advantage of the climate law in a big way; recent Treasury Department data shows more than 3.4 million US households claimed a whopping $8.4 billion to help offset the cost of rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters, home batteries and heat pumps.
In his four years in office, Biden cemented his legacy as the most pro-climate president after making the fight against climate change a central pillar of his administration. He signed billions of new clean energy tax credits and federal grant money into law in 2022 and oversaw dozens of ambitious federal regulations designed to slash pollution from US oil and gas, vehicles and power plants.
Biden will be joined in New York by eight high-profile White House and administration climate and energy officials, including national climate adviser Ali Zaidi, senior adviser to the President for international climate policy John Podesta, Energy Sec. Jennifer Granholm and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan.
Administration officials will make a series of announcements throughout next week, focused on their work to make the US more resilient to climate impacts and giving young people more ways to secure climate and clean energy jobs."

The phenomenon is marked by an increase in stormy weather that erupts when moist, tropical air from near the equator meets hot, dry air from the northern portion of the continent. The focus for this stormy weather – known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone – shifts north of the equator in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. Much of it sags south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere’s warm months.
But since at least mid-July, this zone has shifted farther north than it typically should, sending storms into the southern Sahara, including portions of Niger, Chad, Sudan and even as far north as Libya, according to data from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
As a result, these portions of the Sahara Desert are anywhere from twice as wet to more than six times wetter than they should be.

There are two potential causes for this strange shift north, according to Karsten Haustein, a climate researcher at Leipzig University in Germany.
The transition from El Niño to La Niña has influenced how far north this zone has moved this summer Haustein said. El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – typically leads to drier than normal conditions in the wet portions of West and Central Africa. La Niña, or even a budding one, can have the opposite effect.
A warming world is the other significant factor.
“The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which is the reason for (Africa’s) greening, moves farther north the warmer the world gets,” Haustein explained. “At least, this is what most models suggest.”

A study published in the journal Nature this June found farther northward shifts in this zone could happen more frequently in the next couple decades as carbon dioxide – a byproduct of fossil fuel pollution – levels increase and the world warms.
A devastating sign of things to come
The shift isn’t just turning deserts green, it has disrupted the Atlantic hurricane season and had major consequences over the past few months for several African countries.
Countries that should be getting more rainfall are getting less as storms shift north. Parts of Nigeria and Cameroon typically get drenched with at least 20 to 30 inches of rain from July to September, but have only received between 50 and 80% of their typical rain since mid-July, according to CPC data.
Farther north, typically drier areas, including parts of Niger, Chad, Sudan, Libya and southern Egypt have received more than 400% of their typical rainfall since mid-July, according to CPC data.
Take the northern portion of Chad, which is part of the Sahara Desert. Only up to an inch of rain typically falls here from about mid-July to early September. But anywhere from 3 to 8 inches of rain has fallen in the same timeframe this year, according to CPC data.
This excessive rainfall caused devastating flooding in Chad. Nearly 1.5 million people have been impacted and at least 340 have been killed by flooding in the country this summer, according to a United Nations briefing.
Horrific flooding has also killed more than 220 people and displaced hundreds of thousands in Nigeria, mainly in the typically drier northern portion of the country, CNN previously reported.
Deadly flooding also rocked Sudan in late August, killing at least 132 people and destroying more than 12,000 homes.
Flooding events like these likely have the fingerprints of climate change, according to Haustein, who works on attribution studies to determine to what extent climate change has influenced a particular weather event.
As the world warms, it will be able to hold more moisture, Haustien explained. This could lead to wetter overall monsoons and more devastating flooding like this season.
More research will be needed to determine just how much of role climate change played in each flooding event, but it could be a sign of things to come, Haustien said.
“Every single event is affected by climate change,” Haustein said. “(Even if) no single flood is (directly) caused by climate change, it has been made more likely.”"

The controversial plan to turn a desert green,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/climate/regreen-desert-sinai-egypt/index.html,"The controversial plan to turn a desert green
Ties van der Hoeven’s ambitions are nothing if not grand. The Dutch engineer wants to transform a huge stretch of inhospitable desert into green, fertile land teeming with wildlife.
His sights are set on Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, an arid, triangle-shaped expanse that connects Africa with Asia. Thousands of years ago it was bursting with life, he said, but years of farming and other human activity have helped turn it into a barren desert.
Van der Hoeven is convinced he can bring it back to life.
He has spent years fine tuning an initiative aimed at restoring plant and animal life to roughly 13,500 square miles of the Sinai Peninsula, an area slightly bigger than the state of Maryland. The goal: to suck up planet-heating carbon dioxide, increase rainfall and bring food and jobs to local people.
He believes it is the answer to a slew of huge global problems. “We are destroying our planet in a way which is scary,” he told CNN. “The only holistic way out of this situation is with large-scale ecological regeneration”
So-called desert regreening projects are not new, and this is one of a number around the world seeking to transform arid landscapes. Many aim to halt desertification — the creeping degradation of dry lands — a phenomenon the United Nations calls a “silent, invisible crisis that is destabilizing communities on a global scale.”
But the concept is also controversial; critics say transforming deserts is unproven, enormously complex and could negatively affect water and weather in ways we cannot predict.
The birth of the plan
Van der Hoeven’s background may seem unlikely for someone intent on saving the world. As a hydraulic engineer at Belgian dredging company DEME, he worked on projects including building artificial islands in Dubai.
But in 2016, the course of his career changed when he was pulled into a venture to help the Egyptian government restore shrinking fish populations in Lake Bardawil, a saltwater lagoon in northern Sinai, separated from the Mediterranean by a narrow sandbar. It used to be more than 100 feet deep but is now less than 10 feet deep in parts, as well as hot and salty.
Within a few weeks, van der Hoeven devised a plan to open up the lagoon by creating tidal inlets and dredging “tidal gullies” to get more seawater flowing through, making it deeper, cooler, less salty and more full of marine life.
But the more he researched, the bigger he wanted to go.
Scanning the terrain in Google Earth, he saw the outline of a network of now dried-up rivers, criss-crossing the Sinai like blood vessels, suggesting this land was once green. He pored over weather models and ecological studies and started to see connections.
He could use the sediments dredged from Lake Bardawil to help regreen the surrounding area. “They are salty but they hold very many nutrients and minerals, which you need to start restoring the land,” he said.
He would start with the wetlands around the lake, expanding them to lure the birds and fish.
Then, he would go higher into the region’s mountains, pumping in the lake’s sediments and layering them to create soils where they could grow different varieties of salt-tolerant plants. These would help revitalize the soils, van der Hoeven said, reducing salt levels and making the land able to support a larger array of plants.
Van der Hoeven’s central idea is that adding vegetation to the landscape will mean more evaporation, more clouds forming and more rain falling. It could even change the winds, as greening the region can bring back moisture-laden flows of air, he said.
“This could completely change the weather patterns.”
None of this will be quick.
Van der Hoeven estimates it will take five to seven years to fully revitalize the lake, then between 20 and 40 for the wider regreening.
“It’s really nature telling us the speed,” he said.
Restoration ‘on a planetary scale’
Van der Hoeven’s idea might sound wildly ambitious, but it’s been done before.
As he was feverishly planning the Sinai project, he came across the film “Green Gold,” made by cameraman-turned-ecologist John Liu, which documents a huge desert regreening project in the Loess Plateau in northern China.
The region, nearly the size of California, had been heavily degraded by years of overuse and overgrazing. With sparse vegetation and covered in thin, ocher-yellow soil, it was very prone to erosion.
In an attempt to transform the land, China’s government and the World Bank launched a large-scale regreening program in the 1990s, planting trees and shrubs and implementing grazing bans.
In the decades since, the Loess Plateau has flourished. Parts of the land are now carpeted in green, soil erosion has reduced and less sediment flows into the region’s Yellow River, lowering the flood risks.
For van der Hoeven, it was further proof his plan could work.
He sought out Liu, who was immediately on board. The idea of regreening what was once a “land of milk and honey” was “extremely exciting,” Liu told CNN. “The scale reaches a level that helps prove that restoration can be done on a planetary scale.”
It would add to other huge desert regreening projects also underway.
The Great Green Wall in Africa, for example, was launched in 2007 to help combat desertification.
Originally intended to be a belt of trees planted for thousands of miles across the continent’s Sahel region, the initiative has morphed into a “a mosaic of green and productive landscapes” over 11 countries, said Susan Gardner, director of the ecosystems division at the UN Environment Programme in Nairobi.
Restoration efforts are essential for tackling the climate crisis, nature loss and pollution, Gardner told CNN. “We don’t have a choice. We have to do this; we have to listen to the science and act now.”
A ‘flashy distraction?’
But ecosystems are incredibly complex and when it comes to huge, transformative projects like regreening a desert, some experts are concerned about unintended consequences.
In a project’s quest for a successful finish line, there is a risk that it will opt for fast-growing, non-native species which either don’t survive or become invasive, overtaking the surrounding native plants and damaging wildlife, said Alice Hughes, an assistant professor at Hong Kong University’s School of Biological Sciences. Others are water-thirsty, which can cause conflict with people’s needs.
During the early stages of Africa’s Great Green Wall project, many of the trees died for lack of water, neglect or because they weren’t suitable for the land.
Even in the Loess Plateau, widely credited as an astonishing success, there is evidence the vegetation may be approaching, or even exceeding, what the local water supply can support.
A 2020 study of the region found that higher levels of evaporation from trees and plants had little impact in terms of increasing rainfall, and even led to “lower water availability for agriculture or other human demands.”
Changing the ecosystem could also mean “potentially changing climate patterns, which may reduce moisture and drive droughts elsewhere,” Hughes said. Evaporation may cool one place but simply deposit the heat in other places.
Planting vegetation could even end up having a warming effect. Light-colored deserts can reflect more of the sun’s energy back into space than darker vegetation. “Deserts actually cool the planet,” said Raymond Pierrehumbert, a physics professor at the University of Oxford.
While regreening arid places could bring local cooling effects, Pierrehumbert told CNN, they could end up “leaving the rest of the planet worse off.”
“We also need to ask ourselves why we are doing it,” Hughes said. These projects can act as “flashy distractions,” she added. “They sound much more exciting than the basic work of protecting existing intact systems, which are still vanishing at astonishing rates.”
For Liu, however, there is a big difference between natural deserts and those humans helped create. The argument human-caused deserts should not be touched — even those that have been around for thousands of years — “does not seem logical to me,” he said.
Van der Heoven readily admits the project is complex but believes it’s vital to try. “We should protect nature with all we have, but we should also restore nature with all we have,” he said.
He is studying exactly which plants will be able to attract wildlife and survive future climate change impacts. He also believes changing the climate in the Sinai Peninsula will have a positive ripple effect for the region.
Perhaps one of the biggest obstacles for now is regional instability as the war in Gaza continues.
At the end of 2022, the Egyptian government signed an agreement to start researching and planning the restoration of Lake Bardawil. The project was scheduled to kick off this December, but conflict has slowed everything down, van der Hoeven said.
He’s still confident it will happen and thinks the current situation “creates an even stronger case” for regreening as a way to help bring more opportunity and prosperity.
What is clear is that climate change and biodiversity loss, two interlinked global crises, are getting worse, and in the scramble to solve them, the idea of regreening arid land is gaining currency.
As with many compelling, moonshot ideas to tackle huge, complex problems, there are those who urge caution and warn of the dangerous consequences of rushing in, and there are those who argue the situation is now so urgent, there is no choice but to try them.
Van der Hoeven is firmly in the latter camp.
Regeneration of the natural world “is the only way out of the mess we are currently in,” he said. “There is no time anymore not to act. We should act and accept that we don’t know everything.”"

Follow:
It’s early September – what should be the busiest stretch of hurricane season. Forecasters predicted this one was going to be bad: storm after storm, the most bullish forecasts on record.
Instead, the Atlantic Ocean is enveloped in a rare and strange calm that has flummoxed forecasters and reset their expectations. And the whole thing could be a glimpse at what’s to come as the planet gets hotter.
Despite ideal conditions that fueled pre-season predictions of upwards of 20 named storms, the immediate prospects for one are low, and none have formed in the Atlantic since Ernesto in mid-August – a streak unmatched in 56 years.
“If you had told me a month ago that nothing would (develop) after Ernesto I wouldn’t have believed you,” said Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. “It’s really surprising.”
The strange season has been influenced by extreme atmospheric conditions that are a byproduct of climate change driven by fossil fuel pollution, experts said. And it could also be a “lens” into the more volatile storm behavior of the future, said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
Scientists have long said a warming world will ultimately result in fewer but stronger storms something this season has born the fruit of.
Hurricane forecasters, including Klotzbach, were predicting the calendar flip from August to September would revive the season. Many widely used forecast models signaled the same thing. It didn’t pan out.
The conditions ideal for hurricane development – warm ocean water, minimal storm-disrupting upper-level winds and plenty of moist air – are there, but the storms aren’t happening. Lesser-understood atmospheric factors have gotten in the way, Klotzbach said, and they have ties to global warming.
Take that extremely warm ocean water: The Atlantic has been near-record warm since before the season began. It fueled record-breaking Category 5 Hurricane Beryl, a hurricane with such immense strength so early in the season that it was considered a potential harbinger of a busy season to come.
But warm water can’t intensify storms if they never make it there in the first place.
Almost all hurricanes originate from stormy weather coming off the coast of Central Africa. Since about mid-summer, these hurricane seeds have been pushed farther north than usual – even into one of the driest areas on Earth – the Sahara Desert. They have also exited Africa much farther north than normal and have been stunted as a result. Dry, dusty air and cooler ocean temperatures here, off the continent’s northwest coast, have combined to choke off storms.
The northward shift could be tied to the interaction between extremely warm water in the tropical Atlantic and a small patch of abnormally cool water – a burgeoning Atlantic Niña – near the equator, according to Klotzbach and his group at CSU.

The African monsoon is supercharged with a ton of moisture, something that can actually delay tropical storm development, a study published in June in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems found. It turns out there’s a Goldilocks zone for hurricanes – dry conditions will starve thunderstorms of the fuel they need, but too much can make them so messy that they can’t organize into a cyclone. The moisture needs to be just right.
“For the first time, we’re seeing that this is actually the case,” said the study’s lead author, Kelly Núñez Ocasio, who is also an assistant professor at Texas A&M University. “We’re seeing it right now in the Atlantic hurricane season.”
The scenario could happen more frequently as the world continues to warm because the atmosphere will hold onto more moisture. Further research is needed to definitively determine the change over time, Núñez Ocasio cautioned.
Very warm conditions tied to the climate crisis both at Earth’s surface and higher up in the atmosphere are also limiting the available chaotic energy tropical systems need to form.
Along with warming at the surface, even the highest levels of the troposphere – the layer of Earth where all life and most weather happens – are warming over time, a 2023 study published in the journal Nature found. This trend could potentially keep storminess in the Atlantic much more subdued during the hottest part of the year, similar to what unfolded this year.
The weather weirdness means there are no immediate legitimate storm prospects. If no storms develop by the typical peak of hurricane season on September 10, it would mark a peak-of-season quiet streak unmatched in nearly 100 years, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry.
Still, experts warn the season isn’t finished and could show signs of life soon.
More than 40% of all tropical activity in a typical season occurs after September 10, so there’s plenty of precedent for storms to reinvigorate the Atlantic in the following months.
Klotzbach believes the season could reawaken by the second half of September, when these limiting factors could start to lessen.
And as the season drags on, the area where storms start to form later in hurricane season creeps closer to the Caribbean and the US coastline, including in the Gulf of Mexico which is record-warm. Plus, La Niña is expected to build throughout the fall and could give a boost to activity in October and November.
Anyone in areas at risk for tropical impacts shouldn’t let their guard down because of the recent lull in activity.
Storms “will come back,” Klotzbach cautioned. “I still don’t see this season ending well.”"

Summer broke global heat records for the second straight year, scientists have confirmed — putting 2024 firmly on track to be the hottest year in recorded history.
The period between June and August — summer in the Northern Hemisphere — was the world’s hottest such period since records began in 1940, according to data published Friday by Copernicus, Europe’s climate change service.
This summer was 0.69 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991 to 2020 average, edging past the previous record set last summer by 0.03 degrees, Copernicus found.
It is the latest in a slew of global heat records to fall but will not be the last, scientists warn, as humans continue to pump out planet-heating fossil fuels and drive up global temperatures.
The impacts, and the toll on human health and lives, have been clear, as countries across the world endured brutal summer temperatures, fueling deadly heat waves, record-breaking wildfires and destructive storms.
Even in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter, heat has been extreme.
Last month, Australia broke its national record for the hottest August day, clocking a temperature of 41.6 degrees Celsius (106.9 Fahrenheit). Meanwhile, temperatures in parts of Antarctica climbed 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in July.
The Copernicus data confirms what seemed likely after the planet experienced its hottest June on record, followed in July by its hottest single days on record.
Summer was capped off by the joint-hottest August on record, Copernicus confirmed Friday.
With an average temperature of 16.82 degrees Celsius (62.28 Fahrenheit), it was 1.51 degrees Celsius warmer than an average August in the pre-industrial era, the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels.
Taken together, the 12 months from September 2023 to August 2024 were the hottest on record for any year-long period, and 1.64 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, Copernicus found.
“This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest (calendar) year on record,” Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess said in a statement.
There are a number of factors that cause global temperatures to fluctuate, including natural climate patterns such as El Niño, which originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and has a planet-warming effect, as well as human-caused factors such as burning fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis.
El Niño, which has helped fuel record temperatures, ended in June, but scientists say its impacts don’t stop immediately.
“The record global warmth this summer is expected given the lingering heat from the subsiding El Niño event that has added to the continued heating by emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities,” said Richard Allan, a climate science professor at the University of Reading in the UK.
It’s “extremely alarming” that the past 12 months breached 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, Allan told CNN, but said it was “inevitable given the slow pace of action by governments” to cut planet-heating pollution.
Scientists have long-warned that the world needs to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
While they are more concerned with long-term breaches — over decades rather than single years — the steady drumbeat of temporary breaches is an alarming indication of where the world is headed, and what that means for people’s lives.
Copernicus’ Burgess warned of much worse to come.
“The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” she said."

Fall is a season of transitions: brutally hot summer days give way to crisp fall evenings, green leaves take on colorful hues and fresh summertime flavors are drowned out by the warmth of baking spices.
But while pumpkin spice is already overtaking the country, the familiar fall feel may take much longer to materialize as the warmth of an intensely hot summer in the United States shows signs it could bleed into the new season – a trend as the world warms from fossil fuel pollution.
“The fall season is increasingly being seen as an extension of summer,” said Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at the Yale School of the Environment. “It’s warming fast.”
Intense, frequent and long-lasting warmups will likely make this summer the hottest on record for nearly 100 cities in the West, South and East, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Washington, DC.
Some locations had a brief taste of fall-like weather in the last couple of weeks only to have this summer’s sizzling temperatures reemerge with a vengeance.
Take Philadelphia, for instance. High temperatures in the low to mid-70s made it feel like late-September for a few days last week. But the heat index – how the combination of heat and humidity feels to the body – will hit the triple-digits there on Wednesday.
Tens of millions of people were under heat alerts Wednesday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures possible in the East and widespread highs in the 90s and lows 100s for much of the country.
This temperature rollercoaster could be a theme of the season. Despite continued cool flashes warmth appears poised to stick around in fall for much of the US.
Fall temperatures might not fall much
Fall technically starts in September, but the more consistent cooler temperatures associated with it become more widespread across the country by the second half of the month. The problem is, summerlike heat isn’t going down without a fight, according to the latest forecasts.
The most unusual warmth forecast during the month stretches from the central and southern Rockies southeast through the South and then north up the entire East Coast.
The northern tier of the country from the Pacific Northwest to the Upper Midwest has the greatest chance to remain closer to normal, according to the Climate Prediction Center.
Above-average temperatures will largely continue through October and November, according to the CPC.
The entirety of fall will not feel exactly like summer even with elevated average temperatures. Typical high temperatures drop by around 20 to 25 degrees from mid-July to mid-October for much of the US.
Denver, for example, falls from a normal high near 90 degrees in July to a high in the mid 60s in October.
Hurricanes could lower the thermometer
The East Coast could get somewhat of a reprieve from abnormal warmth this fall if an active hurricane season has anything to say about it.
Despite some quiet periods, the Atlantic hurricane season is expected to pick up again soon. La Niña is expected to build during the fall and could enhance tropical activity in the Atlantic. The natural climate pattern marked by cooler than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean exerts its greatest influence on US weather in winter, but signs of it could arise later this fall.
Forecasters are monitoring potential tropical trouble at the turn of the month; the climatological peak of hurricane season is less than two weeks away; and the most active portion of the season continues through mid-October.
Any storms that pass near US coasts through the end of hurricane season could also unload rain and “result in periods of cooler-than-normal temperatures for these areas this fall,” the CPC said.
The active hurricane forecast also means the East Coast could end the fall wetter than normal.
The other extreme is possible over large sections of the western and central US, where lower than normal precipitation is forecast. A lack of necessary rain could worsen drought conditions in areas that have already spent the summer drying out."

As the need for effective global climate action becomes ever more urgent, a “first-of-its-kind” analysis has identified policies around the world that have done the most to rein in planet-heating pollution — with some surprising results.
Researchers from several European climate institutions analyzed the effectiveness of 1,500 climate policies across 41 countries over the past two decades, in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
They found just 63 “success stories” — standalone policies or combinations that achieved large cuts in climate pollution. While the relatively small number may be “sobering,” the researchers said in a statement, the findings provide a blueprint for what works.
The researchers trawled through vast amounts of climate data to find countries that had significant downturns in pollution — average reductions of 19% — in their building, electricity, industry and transportation sectors between 1998 and 2022. Then they mapped these against the policies those countries introduced or strengthened during the same period.
“We basically do the reverse of what other people have done before,” said Nicolas Koch, an environmental economist at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Germany, and a lead author on the study. “We first look at (climate pollution) effects, and then try to explain the effects with policies.”
Some of the findings were unexpected, Koch told CNN.
When it came to popular climate policies, such as bans on new coal-fired power plants or gas-guzzling cars, “the surprising finding, really, is that we never detect successful large emission reductions if these policy tools are used alone,” he said.
That’s not to say they shouldn’t be implemented, Koch added, but rather they need to be accompanied by other measures, like taxes or price incentives.
Bans on their own “are not credible if the phase-out plan is just out there,” Koch said. But if policy makers also introduce additional measures — a gas-powered car ban plus a climate tax on fuel — then it becomes more credible and changes investor and consumer expectations, he said.
Policy combinations, rather than standalone policies, had the greatest level of success, according to the study.
The United States, for example, experienced a significant reduction in planet-heating pollution from its transportation sector after the 2008 financial crisis. This was due to a mix of tax breaks for low-carbon vehicles as well as a reform in fuel efficiency standards, the study found.
“That combination turned out to be effective … so this really a good news story for the US,” Koch said.
It’s a model Democrats replicated on steroids in 2022 when they passed President Joe Biden’s climate law; pairing a massive amount of tax breaks for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy-efficient home appliances, along with with federal rules to slash emissions from the most-polluting sectors: natural gas and oil, transportation and power generation.
The UK made a big cut in planet-heating pollution from electricity in 2015 and 2016 following a coal phase-out plan, a carbon minimum price for UK power producers, stricter air pollution standards and subsidies for renewable energy.
The policy that did show big climate impacts when implemented alone is arguably one of the least socially popular: taxation.
But a tax on carbon can be complemented with more socially acceptable policies, Koch said, to ensure the burden doesn’t fall on those least able to shoulder it.
Carbon taxes are widely unpopular in the US Congress, but there have been several bills introduced that would implement a “carbon border adjustment tax,” which would tax imported products based on how much pollution they emitted in the country where they were created. Those bills are seen as a response to a similar EU measure passed last year.
Which policies work best varies across countries and sectors and follow-up research is needed to better understand how to design climate policy mixes that work in specific contexts, Koch said.
“This is the most sophisticated study to date,” said Michael Grubb, a professor of international energy and climate change at University College London, who was not involved in the research. “It’s an important step forward in analysis of ‘what works’,” he added.
However, he added, the focus only on big emissions cuts means “they miss the impact of thousands of smaller efforts globally.”
Hanna Fekete, a co-founder of the NewClimate Institute who was also not involved in the research, said the study provides yet more evidence that “current climate action is insufficient.”
Even if the most successful policies implemented so far were scaled up to a global level, it would still not close the gap between where emissions are heading and where they need to be in order to rein in catastrophic warming, she said.
She called on countries to develop a clear vision of where they want to be in 30 or 40 years time, “and then really implement policies today and make them future proof.”"

Tropical activity in an unusually active hurricane season will take a breather after Ernesto, but forecasters don’t believe it will last long.
Atlantic storms will be limited for at least the next week. Dry, dusty air and some disruptive winds in the upper atmosphere are making it difficult for stormy weather to get its act together. A similar setup kept the Atlantic quiet for a few weeks following record-breaking Hurricane Beryl.
But this brief break in activity isn’t likely to last nearly as long, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. Once the dry, dusty air eases, Atlantic tropical activity could be off to the races as stormy weather pushes off the coast of Africa and out to sea unimpeded.
The center’s latest forecast highlights a broad area in the Atlantic from the western coast of Africa to the Caribbean where tropical activity could reignite in late August and early September.
The western tropical Atlantic, just east of the Caribbean, has the greatest chance for development during the same timeframe.
A 40% or greater development chance stretches nearly into mid-September over much of the tropical Atlantic, according to the forecast, so hurricane season might not be hitting the brakes again anytime soon.
This isn’t surprising because the climatological peak of hurricane season is just a few weeks away.
The Atlantic ocean is also still near record-warm, which could help systems develop and potentially explode in strength – something becoming more common in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
Warm water was one of the chief reasons a chorus of expert voices have called for a hyperactive hurricane season, with multiple groups – including NOAA – saying close to two dozen named storms are possible by season’s end.
The season has already been unusually active, producing five named storms – three of which became hurricanes – by mid-August. Ernesto strengthened into the third hurricane of the season almost a month earlier than normal, according to the NHC.
Beryl also shattered expectations when it became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in early July. It was a major hurricane – Category 3 or stronger – almost two months ahead of schedule.
These early storms aren’t the only signal of how unusually active the season has been.
This season is the third most active to date since the 1960s, according to one measure of tropical activity used by hurricane experts. Only 2005 and 1980 had a more active start to hurricane season, according to Michael Lowry, a hurricane expert.
The busiest part of hurricane season typically starts in mid-August, peaks around September 10 and persists into mid-October. About 68% of all Atlantic tropical activity typically unfolds after September 1, according to data tracked by researchers at Colorado State University.
This season has already racked up about half of the activity an entire normal season would produce with plenty of tropical activity to come."

Extreme weather is here to stay. How to financially prepare yourself for a disaster
Follow:
No part of the United States is spared the risk of extreme weather events, which have been hitting harder in recent years.
From wildfires and tornadoes to hurricanes and flooding to prolonged heat waves, the potential damage from extreme weather to people, animals and property is high. Especially if you’re a homeowner. And especially if you live in or near high-risk areas.
However, there are steps you can take right now to help speed the process of repair and recovery after a devastating storm, should you ever be directly hit.
Beyond any physical essentials your family and pets might need if you have to evacuate or shelter in place, pull together an administrative emergency kit, so to speak — physical and virtual.
“Things can happen very quickly. You should have that go bag with all your important documents in an easy-to-remember, easy-to-access place,” said Loretta Worters, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute. “You can get an insurance check pretty quickly if you have all the documentation.”
Visually document what you own
Consider, for example, wildfires. At least 38 states are at risk for them, according to the III. A wildfire can reduce your home and all your belongings to ash. “When [your house] burns there’s nothing to show what you have,” Worters said.
That’s why she recommends taking photos or videos of your house and its contents — even just on your cellphone. Store them in the cloud and if possible keep a physical copy with your important papers or on a flash drive.
Also — and dog and cat owners will no doubt be spoiled for choice — include a current photo of your pet, in case you get separated.
If you do ever get hit with a devastating weather event, be sure to take photos soon after impact, so you can better tell your before-and-after story to insurers, said Keith Turi, acting director of response and recovery at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Make sure you have adequate insurance coverage
Having sufficient insurance is key to preserving your finances and sanity after a disaster. In 2023 alone, there was nearly $80 billion in insured losses due to 89 natural catastrophes in the US like wildfires and flooding, according to the III.
So, periodically check that the policies you do have cover you for the type of extreme weather event that may occur and cover the cost of what you’d want to replace.
For instance, Worters said, stay apprised of rebuilding costs. They may be higher than you think.
Note that if you live in an area prone to floods, standard homeowner policies typically won’t cover flood damage. To learn more about the potential costs of flooding and how to get flood insurance, you can visit floodsmart.gov, Turi recommended.
Lastly, double check that the coverage for your possessions will make you whole — or whole enough. The coverage in most homeowners’ policies for possessions amounts to between 50% and 70% of the value of your home structure, Worters said. So, for every $100,000 in coverage for the structure of your home, you might have $50,000 to $70,000 in coverage for your possessions in the home — from your furniture and household items to your piano.
Keep a physical copy of your insurance coverage and the title and deed to your home in a waterproof or fireproof bag or other container.
Compile your emergency contacts
Make an emergency contact list to keep with your other documents that includes the policy and account numbers for all your insurance policies as well as the insurers’ phone numbers, emails and website addresses — e.g., for health and prescriptions; home, auto and life; plus any pet coverage you may have.
Also include on your list the contact information and account numbers for your bank, investment and retirement accounts.
If you have pets, include your vet’s contact information and that of any boarding facilities you might need to use if ever you have to evacuate. Or, alternatively, the names of pet-friendly places the whole family can stay.
You might also add to your list a FEMA helpline number so you can register for assistance after a disaster: 800-621-3362.
Other essentials to have at the ready
Other key documents that III recommends you have at the ready to throw into your go bag are your birth and marriage certificates, passports, a driver’s license (unless it’s in your wallet on your person), your most recent tax return, any hard-copy stock certificates and your will.
Since you may have to pay initially for hotel or motel rooms and meals immediately after a disaster, the national public service campaign Ready recommends having cash or traveler’s checks available in your emergency kit. Another option if you have more than one credit card is to use your second or third card sparingly, so that you have enough under that card’s credit limit to charge such immediate expenses.

Editor’s Note: Anita van Breda is Senior Director of Environment and Disaster Management at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), based in Washington, DC. She has 20 years of experience working to apply environmentally responsible practices and policies for disaster recovery, reconstruction and risk reduction. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Thirty seconds. Less than 30 seconds was all it took for an earthquake to tear through Haiti in 2010, claiming more than 200,000 lives and leaving 1.5 million people homeless. In the years of rebuilding required after that half-minute of horror, environmental experts like me joined the effort to help.
On fields of rubble that were once bustling neighborhoods, I saw people starting anew. One woman remains seared in my memory: She’d found a dented coffee can, filled it with soil and planted seeds. Green shoots were already growing toward the sun.
Even in the bleakest, seemingly hopeless moments, people gravitate toward nature’s ability to renew and restore. But nature is our ally in more ways than one. By making nature a core part of our disaster recovery strategies — leveraging all the benefits that forests and other ecosystems provide — we can rebuild communities stronger and more resilient than before.
Charting a safer, more resilient course means first acknowledging that there is no such thing as a “natural disaster.” The word “natural” implies these events are entirely out of our control, thereby absolving us of the responsibility to prepare and reduce risk from natural hazards.
But when the ground starts to shake, or floodwaters rush in, it’s not nature’s wrath that’s ultimately responsible for the death toll and destruction. It’s vulnerable social, physical and ecological systems — communities living with inadequate water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, poorly built and maintained infrastructure, and degraded forests, wetlands and coral reefs unable to provide protection from storms.
Because disasters reveal our vulnerabilities, they reflect the choices we make as a society. When we destroy and degrade much of the natural world, we make communities more vulnerable to disasters.
Take our dwindling forests. Cutting down trees removes root systems that anchor the soil and vegetation that soaks up rainfall and protects topsoil from erosion. Without the storage capacity these natural systems provide, the risk of devastating floods and landslides increases. When we channelize riverbeds and build on floodplains, we alter how and when water moves through the landscape. When we remove mangroves and sand dunes along the coast, we expose the shoreline to storm surge.
Nature is fundamental to supporting life on Earth, adapting to a changing climate and reducing disaster risk. Consider a few ways in which communities across the globe are showing what’s possible when we work with nature instead of against it.
One of the core principles of disaster response is “first, do no harm,” and that begins with a thorough post-disaster assessment. After a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Nepal killed more than 8,000 people and destroyed more than a quarter million homes in 2015, the government conducted a rapid environmental assessment to learn how nature was affected by the disaster — and, just as importantly, how it might be affected by the rebuilding process.
Nepal’s assessment served as a blueprint for “building forward” in a way that preserves rather than depletes the natural systems and resources that people need to survive and thrive. By following Nepal’s example and exploring how best to work with the environment, other communities in similar straits can ensure they are better prepared for the future, whether that means using landscape planning to determine the safest locations to rebuild or identifying which crops are most resilient to climate change.
The process of building forward could include, among other things, the adoption of 21st-century clean-energy systems. After a powerful EF-5 tornado destroyed 95% of the town in 2007, Greensburg, Kansas, set sustainable rebuilding goals and integrated wind, solar and geothermal energy into their reconstruction plans. Manmade disasters have also imparted lessons here: In Ukraine, where ongoing war has severely damaged the energy sector, the government has responded by shifting from high-emission thermal power, which harnesses energy from steam, to a renewable energy mix that includes wind, solar, biofuel and battery storage.
Continued reliance on fossil fuels adds fuel to the fire; by reducing harmful carbon emissions, communities like Greensburg and nations like Ukraine are helping to mitigate worse climate impacts. Moreover, their embrace of clean energy adds much-needed redundancy. The fact that many Texans were still without power nearly two weeks after Hurricane Beryl made landfall — amid record summer heat — underscores the perils of depending on a single energy source.
Natural and green infrastructure from wetlands to rain gardens and green roofs — in addition to supporting a diverse array of life — can help communities absorb rainwater, reduce water pollution and regulate temperature. In the wake of Hurricane Stan in 2005, Guatemala and Mexico diversified their farming systems to improve resilience and reduce future disaster risk. Likewise, after Hurricane Michael practically wiped out Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida in 2018, the military bolstered the base’s natural defenses against storm surges by reinforcing dunes, restoring marshes, planting seagrass beds and engineering oyster reefs.
Even the selection of building materials makes an enormous difference. After the 2021 Marshall Fire, the costliest wildfire in Colorado’s history, some rebuilding projects used sustainable materials such as compressed earth blocks. In doing so, they can reduce production and construction costs, provide enhanced protection from fire and flooding and reduce the extraction of more natural resources, which can cause further environmental damage that makes communities more vulnerable to disasters.
In many countries, the United Nations and others have utilized earthquake debris to build homes, infrastructure and riverbank reinforcements. The scale and number of disasters around the world means we are generating a massive amount of disaster debris. Rather than dumping that debris in wetlands or offshore where it can kill seagrass beds and reefs that protect us from storm surges, we can put it to use rebuilding roads and other infrastructure.
We have a choice. We can rebuild the same vulnerabilities by relying only on traditional technology, engineering and materials, or we can embrace innovation and rebuild communities to be safer and more robust in the face of future shocks and stresses.
This choice should not be reserved only for a few select people in positions of power. If communities decide to integrate the power of nature into disaster mitigation solutions to prevent, recover from and rebuild after catastrophes, it’s all hands on deck. By working together across society, policymakers, humanitarians, engineers, community organizers, environmentalists, urban planners, lawyers, business owners, nonprofit groups and everyday citizens can help their communities withstand, recover and rebuild from crises.

Saving Earth’s vital cooling system
This is exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary approach that made Greensburg, Kansas, a success story and a model for the rest of the US and the world. Mayor Bob Dixson followed the science, fostered public-private partnerships and leveraged the unique strengths of local schools, church groups, city councils and more to mobilize a community-wide response.
The collective efforts and vision to recover from the tornado in Greensburg proved that these solutions go beyond partisan politics. You don’t need to believe in climate change to recognize the danger that fires, floods and other natural hazards pose to people, businesses and nature. You just need to recognize that we all have a vested interest in reducing disaster risk, and that environmental management is key to ensuring a safer and more secure future for your community.
Those who have learned from the impact of disasters know that resilient societies require resilient ecosystems — particularly in a world marked by a changing climate. From the small act of planting seeds in a coffee can, to restoring entire forests and wetlands, partnering with nature is essential to our survival."
‘Astonishing’ Antarctica heat wave sends temperatures 50 degrees above normal,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/climate/antarctica-heat-wave-sea-level-rise/index.html,"‘Astonishing’ Antarctica heat wave sends temperatures 50 degrees above normal

A record-breaking heat wave unfolding at what should be the coldest time in Earth’s coldest place has scientists concerned about what it could mean for the future health of the Antarctic continent, and the consequences it could inflict for millions of people across the globe.
Temperatures since mid-July have climbed up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over parts of Antarctica and unseasonable warmth could continue through the first half of August.
The latest data shows high temperatures in portions of East Antarctica – where the most abnormal conditions are ongoing – that are typically between minus 58 and minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit are now closer to minus 13 to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit.
That’s cold, but Bismarck, North Dakota, has reached minus 20 degrees at least once a year in almost every year since 1875. Antarctica’s typical winter cold should be operating at a level unfathomable to most people in the US.
Summerlike heat in the dead of winter – even if much of the continent is still below freezing – is an alarming development for a place more capable than any other of generating catastrophic sea level rise as fossil fuel pollution continues to drive global temperatures upward.
Most of the planet’s ice is stored here, and were it all to melt, would raise average global sea levels by well over 150 feet. Even smaller icy features, like the so-called Doomsday Glacier, could raise sea levels by 10 feet if they were to melt – catastrophic amounts for the world’s coastal communities.
It’s possible more heat waves like this will happen in future winters, which could leave the icy continent less fortified for its hottest season – summer – and more vulnerable to melting during subsequent heat waves, said David Mikolajczyk, a research meteorologist with the Antarctic Meteorological Research and Data Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Increased Antarctic melting could also potentially alter global oceanic circulations, Mikolajczyk told CNN. These circulations play an outsized role in making the planet’s climate habitable.
“I’m sure more (impacts) will emerge with time as we understand (this heat wave) better, but at the moment, it’s just a case of astonishment really, what we’re seeing,”  Thomas Bracegirdle, deputy science leader for the British Antarctic Survey’s Atmosphere, Ice and Climate team, said.
Bracegirdle told CNN the temperatures in this event were record-breaking and were an important signal of what could be coming in the longer term. Heat waves of this magnitude should be quite rare in Antarctica and scientists aren’t yet certain that they are occurring more frequently, but that may be changing.
“All we can say at this stage is that more high temperature extremes are what we expect (in Antarctica) under a changing climate, but for this particular event we’ll have to study more,” Bracegirdle said.
It also contributed significantly to Earth’s new hottest day on record in late June, according to an analysis from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
This is the second significant heat wave Antarctica has endured in the last two years. During the previous in March 2022, temperatures in some locations reached up to 70 degrees above normal, the most extreme temperature departures ever recorded in this part of the planet.
That unprecedented heat wave was made worse by climate change, according to a 2023 study published in Geophysical Research Letters. Climate change contributed 3.6 degrees of warming to the heat wave and could worsen similar heat waves by 9 to 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, the study found.
While the current heat wave hasn’t seen temperature departures reach the level of 2022, it’s been much more expansive and long-lasting, according to Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder.
And the crucial differences between the two come down to what’s happening in the atmosphere.
‘A very unusual event’
The set of atmospheric conditions largely responsible for the ongoing heat wave – a breakdown of the southern polar vortex – is only expected to occur once every two decades on average, according to Bracegirdle.
“This is a very unusual event, from that perspective,” Bracegirdle added.
Just like the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere has a polar vortex – strong winds circulating high in the atmosphere that trap cold air in place.
But when the southern polar vortex gets disrupted, it releases cold air trapped over Antarctica and sends bursts of it farther north. This also leaves the door open for air to rush down from the upper atmosphere, warming along the way.
The southern polar vortex is disrupted much less frequently than its northern counterpart, which explains why such heat waves are much less frequent, according to Amy Butler, a research physicist at NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory.
This polar vortex disruption began in the second half of July and could continue through the first half of August, perhaps peaking in intensity in about a week, Butler told CNN. This will keep temperatures at the surface elevated.
At the same time, multiple surges of warm air from the southwestern Indian Ocean pushed over East Antarctica – which comprises about two-thirds of the entire continent. Each surge of warm air was followed by another so closely that the warming has been nearly continuous over the last few weeks, according to Scambos.
East Antarctica – home to the South Pole – is where the most frigid conditions on Earth are found and is typically protected from this kind of extreme warmth, according to Mikolajczyk. But that wasn’t the case in this event or in 2022’s.
It’s part of a larger trend with already measured consequences.
The South Pole warmed more than three times the global average rate from 1989 to 2018, a 2020 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found.
West Antarctica and its Thwaites “Doomsday” Glacier have been a major focus of scientific research in recent years due to the catastrophic impact its collapse would have on sea level rise. But other research in the last few years has demonstrated that melting in East Antarctica, where this heat wave is happening, is becoming equally troubling.
The recent warmth has posed a significant problem to the continent’s crucial ice sheet. Antarctica lost a staggering 280% more ice mass in the 2000s and 2010s than it lost in the 1980s and 1990s, according to a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“In recent years, I would say that the feeling was that the Arctic is the place where all the rapid change is happening and (change) was happening quite slowly in Antarctica,” Mikolajczyk mused. “But this is just another event that’s showing (change) can also happen quickly in Antarctica.”"
Tropical Storm Debby forecast to hit Florida this weekend with torrential rain and wind,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/weather/florida-tropical-depression-storm-debby-hurricane-climate/index.html,"Tropical Storm Debby forecast to hit Florida this weekend with torrential rain and wind
Follow:
A tropical storm warning has been issued and a state of emergency declared in parts of Florida in anticipation of Tropical Storm Debby – a storm that hasn’t yet formed but could unleash multiple days of heavy, flooding rainfall to the state and the southeast United States starting this weekend.
The system has 30 mph winds and has been designated Tropical Depression Four by the National Hurricane Center as it comes together over parts of Cuba and the southern Bahamas Friday. It became organized enough to be classified as a tropical depression Friday, according to the 11 p.m. advisory from the hurricane center.
Track the Storm: Spaghetti models and more maps here
The storm is expected to strengthen into Tropical Storm Debby by Saturday evening.
Tropical storm watches and warnings have been extended northward in Florida, according to the 5 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center.
The tropical storm warning has been extended along the west coast of the Florida peninsula from Bonita Beach to Boca Grande. Meanwhile, the tropical storm watch has been extended northward from Aripeka to the mouth of the Suwannee River.
Parts of the Florida Keys and parts of the Central Florida coast are also under a tropical storm watch, with officials urging residents there to prepare for tropical storm conditions within the next 48 hours. The watch includes Fort Myers, Cape Coral and Tampa Bay.
The storm’s exact track and strength are still uncertain. How much time the system spends over record-warm water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico will determine how strong it becomes.
The storm is expected to turn to the northwest and eventually north over the weekend. However, so far the system has not begun its turn to the northwest, which has led the hurricane center to shift the forecast cone to the west.
This will allow more time for strengthening and the hurricane center shows the storm nearing hurricane strength by the time it reaches landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida Monday morning.
“The westward shift to the track forecast now also keeps the system over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico longer, giving the system additional time to potentially strengthen,” the hurricane center said. “It is important to note that because of the forecast track being parallel to the west coast of Florida, the location and timing of a potential landfall cannot be pinned down at this time.”
It will track parallel to Florida’s Gulf Coast for some time this weekend and strengthen as it does so, before curving east and making landfall. The system’s strength would be limited if it moves more quickly over Florida.
“Since the forecast track is almost parallel to the west coast of the Florida Peninsula and the southeast coast of the US, only a small change in the track could lead to large changes in which land areas receive any landfalls and the biggest impacts,” the National Hurricane Center cautioned Friday.
Where and when the storm comes ashore and how strong it is at that time will affect the risk of storm surge. For now, up to 3 feet of storm surge is possible this weekend along the coast from South Florida to north of Tampa Bay.
No matter its strength, torrential, flooding rain will be the most significant impact from the storm, especially if the system were to slow down, a possible scenario.
The flood threat prompted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency. The order was issued Thursday for 54 of the state’s 67 counties to mobilize state and local resources ahead of the storm.
Sandbag distribution began Friday for residents in several communities in the Orlando and Tampa metros. Multiple counties in the state’s panhandle – including Escambia, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa – started distributing sandbags Thursday.
A level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Saturday for much of South Florida as the system organizes just off the coast, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
“Very intense” rainfall rates of 2.5 to 3 inches per hour are possible within the heaviest storms in the system’s outer rain bands Saturday, the WPC warned. Rainfall rates this potent are enough to cause flash flooding, even in marshy areas of the state more capable of handling excess water.
The risk to life and property would increase considerably if these intense storms reach the Miami area. Up to 20 inches of rain deluged South Florida in a very short window in early July and produced extremely dangerous flash flooding across the greater Miami metro, resulting in a couple hundred water rescues.
The level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall will expand over much of the state and reach into other portions of Georgia and the Carolinas Sunday.
Exactly when and where torrential downpours set up outside of Florida will depend on the system’s ultimate track, but heavy rain is possible as early as Sunday afternoon. It’s also possible that this risk level will increase – especially in Florida – once the system’s track comes into further focus.
Heavy rain will continue to pound parts of the Southeast early next week, especially if, instead of tracking steadily along the Florida Gulf Coast and making landfall, the system slows down and stalls over one region – potentially around Florida’s Big Bend.
Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible through Monday over much of Florida and the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas. But if the system happens to stall, rainfall totals could increase dramatically.
Freshwater flooding – flooding caused by rainfall – has become the deadliest aspect of tropical systems in the last decade, according to research conducted by the National Hurricane Center.
A world warming due to fossil fuel pollution is making this potential threat more dangerous. Studies have also shown tropical systems are slowing down over time, which means they’re more likely produce greater rainfall totals over a given area.
Oceans are also getting warmer and supercharging storms, pumping them full of moisture. A 2022 study published in the journal Nature Communications found climate change increased hourly rainfall rates in tropical storms by 5 to 10% and in hurricanes by 8 to 11%.

Follow:
The eerie calm over the Atlantic basin that settled in after historic Hurricane Beryl is about to be shattered.
It’s been more than three weeks since deadly Beryl made its final landfall in Texas. Dry, dusty air has helped keep the Atlantic hurricane-free ever since.
But a disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms in the eastern Caribbean is expected to encounter favorable atmospheric conditions by this weekend and develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm.
The next tropical storm that forms will be given the name Debby.
The system will track along the northern Caribbean through Friday before emerging near the Bahamas or Florida early this weekend.
It’s exact track through the Caribbean will determine when a tropical system could form. It will likely struggle to organize enough to be considered a tropical depression or storm if it interacts with the disruptive mountainous areas of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and eastern Cuba.
The tropical wave could organize sooner if it skims just north of the islands and dodges the terrain.
Ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf are abnormally warm and could strengthen the system, no matter when and where it forms.
It’s still unclear what path the system will take. A strong area of high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean could steer the cyclone anywhere from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to the southeast US coast over the weekend, but its early strength or lack thereof will play a factor in which way it will go.
The faster organization occurs, the more likely the cyclone will curve northward sooner and take a track that places the Bahamas and southeast US in its path. A more disorganized system could travel much farther west and approach the Gulf before curving north.
An ocean primed for storms
August typically marks the beginning of the most active part of hurricane season because ocean waters are very warm, and disruptive upper-level winds and dry, dusty air fade.
But ocean temperatures across the Atlantic have been anything but typical this season, and have already proved their mettle.
Beryl was able to become the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in early July partly because waters in the Caribbean were as warm as they normally would be at the peak of hurricane season. Now, parts of the Caribbean and Atlantic are as warm or warmer than they typically are in early October when ocean heat maxes out.
Warm oceans are a major consequence of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and provide the fuel for tropical systems to explode in strength at a breakneck pace.
Off-the-charts ocean heat is one reason a chorus of forecasters are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season. A building La Niña and its subsequent lack of disruptive upper level winds, known as wind shear, over the Atlantic are the others.
The season started off close to average when Tropical Storm Alberto formed in mid-June – the typical timing for the first named storm of the season. But any semblance of normalcy quickly dissipated once Beryl roared to life at the end of the month.
The season’s first hurricane normally forms around August 11 and the first Category 3 or stronger hurricane occurs around September 1, according to the NHC. Beryl obliterated both timeframes.
In addition to Alberto and Beryl, the basin also churned out short-lived Tropical Storm Chris."

Follow:
The Atlantic Ocean has been on a nearly three-week long rest after producing historic Hurricane Beryl, but the basin is about to wake up.
“There’s definitely some (tropical activity) coming,” Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University, said. “It’s coming sooner rather than too much later.”
Tropical activity in the Atlantic typically starts to ramp up in August, particularly during the second half of the month. But this season – which is expected to be hyperactive – got off to a historic start when Beryl exploded into a ferocious Category 5 hurricane in early July.
Beryl was supercharged by ocean waters as warm as they should be in September – a phenomenon becoming more common as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution.
The rapidly intensifying hurricane also had two other ingredients needed for storms to form that have been missing ever since: moist air and a lack of storm-disrupting upper level winds, called wind shear.
Ocean temperatures are still off the charts, but a vast expanse of dry, dusty air has limited moisture and helped rein in tropical activity over the Atlantic post-Beryl.
This so-called Saharan dust originates from dust storms in Africa, gets trapped in a layer of air above the surface and is then carried out over the Atlantic by persistent winds.
Batches of Saharan dust flow out of Africa and over the Atlantic year-round, but high concentrations peak in the early summer, just like this year.
This July has so far produced the month’s second-highest concentration of dust over the tropical Atlantic on record, according to an analysis by hurricane expert Michael Lowry. Reliable satellite data for this measurement begins in 2002.

The Saharan Air Layer!Our crews flew MAGPIE (Moisture and Aerosol Gradients/Physics of Inversion Evolution) project missions on NOAA WP-3D Orion #NOAA43 “Miss Piggy” out of Barbados.This project researches… pic.twitter.com/fB0SfEiTzP
But this disruptive dry, dusty air isn’t sticking around and will likely dissipate in August, according to Klotzbach.
Dust wasn’t the only factor keeping the Atlantic quiet after Beryl. Upper-level winds were too hostile for hurricanes to develop in July, but signs point to calmer winds and favorable conditions in the weeks to come, according to Klotzbach.
Klotzbach estimates all of the necessary atmospheric conditions will come together in the next week and a half, which will open the door for more hurricanes.
While Klotzbach doesn’t think a storm is guaranteed to form immediately after conducive conditions align, it’s only a matter of time before one does.
Forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center highlight an area for potential tropical development from July 31 to August 6. Part of the western Atlantic and the Caribbean has at least a 20% chance of tropical development during that timeframe.
That 20%-or-greater chance persists through mid-August and expands across almost the entire tropical Atlantic, from west of Cabo Verde into the eastern Caribbean.
The most active period of the Atlantic hurricane season typically runs from mid-August to mid-October, with activity peaking around September 10.
Once hurricane season wakes up again, quiet periods could be few and far between."

This oil capital wants to be a hub for climate tech
Follow:
Abu Dhabi isn’t about to wean itself off the oil that made it super rich. But it is putting some of that wealth to work in support of startups trying to find solutions for the climate crisis.
In April, Abu Dhabi tech ecosystem Hub71 announced its first-ever program designed to support decarbonization technologies, which included five startups focused on solutions for sectors ranging from energy to aquaculture.
“The climate agenda is very important to the leadership of the UAE,” Ahmad Ali Alwan, the CEO of Hub71, which is backed by state fund Mubadala Investment Company, told CNN. “So we identified it to be a priority sector which we want to enable.”“There’s a lot of support for innovative solutions,” he said, and “a focus on developing solutions that are actually commercial.”
The United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven emirates including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was the first Gulf country to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In recent years Abu Dhabi has funneled tens of billions of dollars into supporting renewable energy projects and carbon reduction technologies, and restored some 6,400 hectares of mangroves, which can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Alwan says that about 20 of the more than 220 startups involved in Hub71’s programs can be put into the sustainability and climate technology bucket. Now that the ecosystem has a program dedicated to these companies, he expects that number to grow.
Hub71 plans to announce a new cohort later this year, and it says that applications from sustainability and climate tech startups have doubled since the last intake.
Abu Dhabi is far from abandoning fossil fuels. Oil production accounts for about 46% of its economy.
The UAE, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has in recent years found itself at odds with the group’s leadership. OPEC and its allies have been limiting oil output to prevent a glut and bolster prices. Meanwhile, the UAE has been pushing the alliance to raise its production quota.
State-owned oil giant Adnoc wants to increase its capacity to five million barrels per day by 2027. It will spend $150 billion to meet that target, according to S&P Global.
Reshaping its economy
Abu Dhabi’s continued dependence on oil has caused doubts in some quarters about its commitment to decarbonization.
But experts say the government is planning ahead to reshape its economy. Patricia Keating, of consultancy PwC Middle East, told CNN the government has laid out a forward-looking diversification strategy focused on how it can grow sustainably.
“Abu Dhabi is starting to forge ahead as a leading tech cluster for climate in the region,” she said.
The city has a concentration of venture capitalists and investment funds, attractive regulation and corporates that need to decarbonize, she added, giving it an edge in the climate technology space.
Companies in the latest Hub71 cohort include a startup that provides oil and gas plant engineers with real-time recommendations about how to reduce emissions, and another focused on mitigating gas flaring — the burning of or releasing of natural gas that comes out of the ground during oil production, which contributes to climate change.
Another, called Graphmatech, is a spin-off from Sweden’s Uppsala University, and claims its graphene technology can make the hydrogen industry more sustainable, efficient and safer.
When hydrogen is burned or used in a fuel cell, the major biproduct is water, instead of atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide. This makes the energy source a lower emissions option compared to other fuels that pollute more.
That Abu Dhabi has thrown its weight and oil wealth behind climate tech is a key attraction for Graphmatech.
“To scale up climate tech you need financial support,” Dr Mamoun Taher, its founder and CEO, told CNN. “Abu Dhabi is known globally to have financial muscles.”
Experts believe that green hydrogen, which is produced with renewable energy, can play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, like heavy industry and long-distance transport.
An emerging industry
Countries from the United States to Australia are working to develop their own hydrogen industries, and the UAE wants to become one of the world’s largest producers of the element by 2031.
It plans to produce “low-carbon” hydrogen generated from a variety of sources, including renewable and nuclear energy, and fossil fuels paired with carbon capture and storage.
There is work underway in the UAE to push hydrogen technology forward. Masdar and Emirates Steel Arkan are developing a pilot project to demonstrate the possibility of using green hydrogen, instead of natural gas, to make steel. Steel production accounts for about 8% of global emissions.
Hydrogen, though, is known to leak. Not only is that wasteful, it can also lead to explosions and exacerbate global warming.
Taher says his graphene technology can reduce the leakage of hydrogen by up to 85%. His company has engaged in discussions with key stakeholders in Abu Dhabi, including oil and gas companies.
“What makes Abu Dhabi unique is the access to the early adopters for our technology,” he said.
Companies including Adnoc, Siemens Energy and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) are supporting the Hub71 program with funding or commitments to run pilot programs with promising solutions, or both — potentially allowing climate startups to use the UAE as a test bed for their technologies.

Here’s where Kamala Harris stands on climate and energy,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/climate/kamala-harris-on-climate-energy/index.html,"Here’s where Kamala Harris stands on climate and energy
Follow:
As Vice President Kamala Harris marches toward the Democratic nomination, climate advocates like what they see.
Even before he’s finished his term, President Joe Biden made his stamp as the most pro-climate president in history. And Harris is an exciting climate candidate in her own right, multiple advocates told CNN.
Harris is a “tremendous champion” on climate and environmental justice, said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund.
Climate action has run through Harris’s career for decades. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. And as vice president, Harris made the crucial tie-breaking vote to pass Democrats’ historic climate bill.
“Vice President Harris would kick ass against Trump,” Biden’s first national climate adviser Gina McCarthy said in a statement. “She will fight every day for all Americans to have access to clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment.”
Harris’s candidacy comes at a make-or-break moment for the planet. 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 has only continued that trend, with fresh data showing July 21 was the hottest day on record globally.
With rising global temperatures pushing the world closer to irreparable harm, scientists and energy groups say the only way to minimize the damage is to rapidly deploy clean energy on a massive scale by the end of this decade.
Advocates say Harris’s record on climate couldn’t be more different from her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump – a man who has vowed to pull the US out of its climate commitments and to “drill, baby, drill.”
With Democrats quickly uniting around Harris, they are eager to shine the spotlight back on Trump’s agenda.
“It’s largely been forgotten how disastrous Trump has been on climate and how disastrous it would be for our planet if he’s elected again,” Jamal Raad, co-founder and former executive director of Evergreen Action, told CNN.
How Democrats plan to campaign on climate
The stakes of the 2024 election for the global climate couldn’t be higher.
Trump has vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments.
Given the stakes, climate advocates are eager to shine a light on the stark contrast between Trump and Harris.
“Harris wants to keep building this bright clean energy future, and Trump and Big Oil really do represent the worst of our past,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of advocacy group Climate Power.
Republicans are already attacking Harris on energy, specifically for her earlier support of a fracking ban during her 2020 campaign for president. Biden opposed such a ban, and Harris later walked back that support when she became his running mate.
Democrats are hoping to use their climate agenda to motivate young people, which polls showed Biden was struggling with. Advocates said Democrats may benefit from a younger candidate speaking to young voters on climate.
And advocates added Harris’s detachment from some of Biden’s more controversial moves on climate as president – such as his approval last year of the massive Alaska oil drilling project known as Willow – may benefit her.
Members of the youth climate group Sunrise Movement will be watching to see whether Harris moves to distinguish herself from Biden on Willow, Sunrise Movement spokesperson Stevie O’Hanlon told CNN.
“Does Harris break from Biden’s most unpopular decisions with young people?” O’Hanlon said. “She has an opportunity to define herself as a new candidate and as different from Biden. That’s the critical work for her in the coming days.”
Second-term priorities
A second Democratic administration will continue implementing Biden’s climate bill and defend many of Biden’s marquee climate rules against legal challenges.
If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the planet would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement—the same agreement Trump has vowed he would once again pull the US out of if elected.
A recent analysis from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group found that while the US isn’t on track to hit Biden’s goal of slashing US emissions in half by 2030, it could surpass that goal by 2035. The Rhodium report shows cutting emissions in the power sector will be essential to US climate goals, and that will take strong Environmental Protect Agency rules in addition to Biden’s climate bill.
“It will matter who’s in control of the EPA,” Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN.
Harris has maintained a close working relationship with Biden’s environmental cabinet heads, including EPA administrator Michael Regan.
The two have traveled together, including on a listening tour on lead pipes. Speaking to CNN, Regan recalled an emotional and in-depth conversation Harris had with a Milwaukee mother whose son was affected by lead poisoning.
“She engaged in a conversation with that mother that I’ll never forget,” Regan said. “There isn’t a lot of relief you can provide to someone who has gone through that experience, but she found a way to connect.”
Whether on lead pipes or dispersing billions in climate funding, Regan said Harris is a leader who “doesn’t do surface – she digs in.”"
Summer of devastating floods shows steep challenge for China as it grapples with extreme weather,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/china/china-floods-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html,"Summer of devastating floods shows steep challenge for China as it grapples with extreme weather
Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
As temperatures soared across parts of central China’s agricultural heartland last month, farmers struggled with day after day without rain.
In sweltering Henan province, many scrambled to irrigate parched crops during what is usually a key growing period, while authorities ordered water use to be limited and for clouds to be artificially seeded in an effort to prod rain clouds, state media reports said.
Just one month later, however, parts of the province were awash – pounded by extreme rain that inundated tens of thousands of acres of cropland and forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to state media.
Parts of Henan’s hardest-hit Nanyang city saw more than 600 millimeters (about 24 inches) of rain in 24 hours – three-quarters of what they would normally expect in a whole year. Rescuers navigated streets on speedboats, at times wading through waist-deep floodwaters to pluck people from their homes, footage circulating online showed.
It’s a story playing out across China. In the past two weeks, tens of thousands have been evacuated across multiple provinces in the country following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock.
The lurch from dry weather to flooding also throws into sharp focus the major challenge for the Chinese government as emergency response and recovery becomes a regular occurrence – and as extreme weather is only expected to become more frequent due to human-driven climate change.
The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces last week – and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks – has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that’s forecast to continue.
Torrential rainfall has hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule and only last week entered what’s known as its peak period.
China’s ruling Communist Party acknowledged the urgency of the situation last week, when a communique following a landmark meeting of its top members led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to “refine the measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling natural disasters, especially floods.”
The government has in recent years grown increasingly alert to the domestic risk of climate change – including its potential impact on food security as drought and floods hit lands critical for the national grain supply.
China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has looked to position itself as a leader in the global transition to green energy – even as it’s met challenges weaning itself off coal due to high demand for power.
Authorities are meanwhile grappling with the latest crises amid mounting social frustration with China’s stuttering economy and the broader direction of the country – and as local governments strapped with high levels of debt are tasked with recovery efforts.
Before last week’s floods, natural disasters had already cost nearly $13 billion in direct economic losses and affected 32 million people this year, China’s Ministry of Emergency Management said on July 12.
“Last night I couldn’t sleep at all,” one farmer in Henan’s Nanyang city said as he surveyed submerged crop fields in a video posted to social media and shared by a government-linked account.
“All my hard work for a year has come to nothing.”
Deepening challenge
As the heavy rains moved across central China in recent days, accounts of loss and devastated livelihoods also spread across social and local media.
At least 34 people have been killed since last weekend due to flooding and landslides, including 15 who died in a bridge collapse in Shaanxi province Friday following flash floods and heavy rain. It comes after flooding and landslides late last month killed at least 71 people in southern China.
One video posted on social media showed a farmer in Sichuan province wading through chest-high waters to pick corn – clearly determined not to lose his harvest.
Meanwhile, a farmer in flood-hit Hunan lost more than 800 pigs – taking a hit of about $275,000 – after his barn was inundated this month, he told state-backed Agricultural Television.
Retailers and farmers have also taken to social media to sell flooded crops at a discount – for many a last-ditch attempt to salvage an income in a country where research shows insurance coverage is low compared with other major economies.
As of Sunday, 10 provinces were under emergency alerts for flooding, according to national weather authorities, with more heavy rain expected in the coming days.
A typhoon that hit China’s Hainan island Monday is expected to make landfall on the mainland as a tropical storm Tuesday, while a cyclone that could strengthen to a typhoon is expected to hit coastal China later this week, according to CNN Weather.
China’s government has mounted a top-down effort to revamp how the country responds to extreme weather in recent years after 2021 floods in Henan’s Zhengzhou killed more than 300 people. And climate scientists earlier this month issued a stark warning, calling the country a “hotspot where the impacts of climate change are acutely felt.”
Observers say authorities have made progress, especially when it comes to early warnings and response, weather monitoring and certain infrastructure development – but they also note more must be done in China – like many countries grappling with climate change – to prepare for the impact of more frequent extreme weather.
“While policies and strategies are being developed and implemented, the pace and scale of action often fall short of what is needed to effectively mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change,” said Hongzhang Xu, an adjunct research fellow at the Australian National University.
That need may be more acute in remote, rural or mountainous regions, often populated by vulnerable elderly populations and with fewer resources, as well as provinces not historically prone to severe flooding, like in China’s northeastern breadbasket, which endured extreme rains last year.
Guangtao Fu, a professor of water intelligence at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, said that although the government has been investing in water infrastructure to boost flood protection there was a “significant gap” in investment to maintain existing systems.
That urgency was underscored earlier this month when a dike alongside China’s second-largest freshwater lake burst after 17 days of heavy rains – flooding nearly 20 square miles of land and displacing at least 7,000 people, according to official reports.
Another challenge, experts say, is bolstering recovery from severe flooding, where damaged croplands, destroyed homes and devastated livelihoods can take months to recover.
Local governments are typically tasked with managing reconstruction efforts, while the central government plays a role in planning and financing. But there have been past issues of misappropriation of state recovery funds, for example following the deadly 2021 floods in Zhengzhou.
And only about 8% of an aggregate $25 billion in losses in China from flooding caused by Typhoon Doksuri last summer were covered by insurance, according to data from global insurance firm Munich Re.
“Farmlands need to be re-plowed, and fully restoring soil quality would take several months,” said Li Zhao, a senior researcher at Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing. “For the residential houses, each household should spend a lot of money to rebuild – just to recover from this kind of event is very difficult.”
Those living in flood-prone areas also face a tough choice as the risks grow, she added.
“Maybe in the future, we will see how people make the decision,” she said. “Are they moving to a safer place? Or will they go back to the villages (and rebuild)?”

"Climate change is messing with time more than previously thought, scientists find",https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/15/climate/polar-ice-melting-day-length-time/index.html,"Climate change is messing with time more than previously thought, scientists find

The impacts of human-caused climate change are so overwhelming they’re actually messing with time, according to new research.
Polar ice melt caused by global warming is changing the speed of Earth’s rotation and increasing the length of each day, in a trend set to accelerate over this century as humans continue to pump out planet-heating pollution, according to the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The changes are small — a matter of milliseconds a day — but in our high-tech, hyperconnected world have an important impact on computing systems we have come to rely on, including GPS.
It’s yet another sign of the huge impact humans are having on the planet. “This is a testament to the gravity of ongoing climate change,” said Surendra Adhikari, a geophysicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a report author.
The number of hours, minutes and seconds making up each day on Earth are dictated by the speed of the Earth’s rotation, which is influenced by a complex knot of factors. These include processes in the planet’s fluid core, the ongoing impact of the melting of huge glaciers after the last ice age, as well as melting polar ice due to climate change.
For millennia, however, the impact of the moon has dominated, increasing the length of a day by a few milliseconds per century. The moon exerts a pull on Earth causing the oceans to bulge towards it, gradually slowing Earth’s rotation.
Scientists have previously made connections between polar ice melt and longer days, but the new research suggests global warming is a bigger influence on time than recent studies have shown.
In the past, the impact of climate change on time “has not been so dramatic,” said Benedikt Soja, a study author and assistant professor of space geodesy at the Swiss university ETH Zurich.
But that could be changing. If the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution, “climate change could become the new dominant factor,” outpacing the moon’s role, ﻿he told CNN.
It works like this: As humans warm the world, glaciers and ice sheets are melting, and that meltwater is flowing from the poles toward the equator. This changes the planet’s shape — flattening it at the poles and making it bulge more in the middle — slowing its rotation.
The process is often compared to a spinning ice skater. When the skater pulls their arms in towards their body, they spin faster. But if they move their arms outwards, away from their body, their spin slows.
The team of international scientists looked at a 200-year period, between 1900 and 2100, using observational data and climate models to understand how climate change has affected day length in the past and to project its role in future.
They found the impact of climate change on day length has increased significantly.
Climate change-fueled sea level rise caused the length of a day to vary between 0.3 and 1 milliseconds in the 20th century. Over the past two decades, however, the scientists calculated an increase in day length of 1.33 milliseconds per century, “significantly higher than at any time in the 20th century,” according to the report.
If planet-heating pollution continues to rise, warming the oceans and accelerating ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica, the rate of change is set to soar, the report found. If the world is unable to rein in emissions, climate change could increase the length of a day by 2.62 milliseconds by the end of the century — overtaking the natural impacts of the moon.
“In barely 200 years, we will have altered the Earth’s climate system so much that we are witnessing its impact on the very way Earth spins,” Adhikari told CNN.
A few milliseconds of additional time a day may be imperceptible to humans but it has an impact on technology.
Precise timekeeping is vital for GPS, which everyone with a smartphone will have, as well as other communication and navigation systems. These use highly precise atomic time, based on the frequency of certain atoms.
From the late 1960s, the world started using coordinated universal time (UTC) to set time zones. UTC relies on atomic clocks but still keeps pace with the planet’s rotation. That means at some point “leap seconds” need to be added or subtracted to keep alignment with the Earth’s rotation.
Some studies have also suggested a correlation between an increase in day length and an increase in earthquakes, said Mostafa Kiani Shahvandi, a study author and a geoscientist at ETH Zurich. But the connection remains speculative and much more research needs to be done to establish any clear link, he told CNN.
A paper on the same topic published in March concluded that while climate change was increasingly slowing the Earth’s rotation, processes in the Earth’s core could be more important and actually be speeding it up, shortening day length.
“What we have done is to go a little bit further and re-estimate these trends,” said Shahvandi. They found any influence from the molten core was outweighed by that of climate change.
Duncan Agnew, professor of geophysics at the University of California San Diego and author of the March study, said the new study still meshes with his research, “and is valuable because it extends the result further into the future and looks at more than one climate scenario.”
Jacqueline McCleary, an assistant professor in physics at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study, said the new research helps inform “a decades-long debate over what role, exactly, climate change will play in the changing length of the day.”
While there is now general agreement climate change will have a “net lengthening effect on the day,” she told CNN, there has still been uncertainty about which processes affecting time will dominate this century. This study concludes climate change is now the second-most dominant factor, she said.
It’s a sobering conclusion, said ETH Zurich’s Soja. “We have to consider that we are now influencing Earth’s orientation in space so much that we are dominating effects that have been in action for billions of years.”"

Earlier this week, the Third Avenue Bridge in Manhattan had to be shut down because the bridge – which pivots to allow ships to pass – wouldn’t close correctly. Why? Because it was so hot in New York City that day the metal in the bridge swelled, and the closing mechanism wouldn’t work. Firefighters had to spray water on the structure for several hours to cool it off before the bridge could be reopened to traffic.
A tragedy? Hardly. But it’s evidence of one of the central truths of our time, and one that is becoming more and more apparent every day: We have built our world for a climate that no longer exists.
Consider Houston, the throne of Big Oil, where the electric grid has the same hub-and-spoke basic architecture as it did 100 years ago. This week, Hurricane Beryl knocked out power to more than 2 million homes. Yes, hurricanes are devastating. But less than two months earlier, a sudden windstorm in the city blacked out electricity for more than a million people.
How many blackouts will it take before we realize today’s power grid was built for yesterday’s climate?
Or consider the wildfires in California earlier this month. They occurred during a heatwave that broke many all-time temperature records in the West, including an astonishing 122 degrees Fahrenheit in Palm Springs. One consequence of this heat was that it was too hot for firefighters to fight the fires without risking heatstroke.
If it were much hotter, water bombers and helicopters could not fly, radically diminishing firefighters’ ability to control the flames.
Once you start to look, danger signs of Old World infrastructure are everywhere. The vast majority of buildings and homes in European cities like London, Paris and Madrid have no air conditioning. When an extreme heat wave hits, the people who live and work in them are increasingly vulnerable (one recent study published in Nature Medicine estimated there were more than 60,000 heat-related deaths in Europe during the summer of 2022).
Once you start to look, danger signs of Old World infrastructure are everywhere.
Jeff Goodell
Reservoir dams around the world are stressed by extreme rainfall events. Airport tarmacs soften in the heat, causing flights cancellations. Sea walls that protect coastal cities from flooding are more and more ineffective as sea level rises and storm surges become more powerful. Cities are becoming human frying pans. In Phoenix this summer, surface temperatures on streets and sidewalks hit 160 degrees Fahrenheit – even a few seconds of contact could cause severe burns.
And it’s not just infrastructure that is maladapted to our rapidly warming world. Our economic systems and cultural lives are out of sync, too. The Summer Olympics (and American football) become dangerous games in 100-degree heat. The insurance business was not structured to deal with permanent flooding from sea level rise. Religious pilgrimages, such as the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, during which more than 1,300 people died amid blistering temperatures last month, are not supposed to be essentially death marches.
Big automakers like Toyota and GM, both of which have been slow to adapt to the EV revolution, risk sharing the fate of Kodak at the dawn of the digital age. Even Big Oil executives – the ones that I’ve talked to, anyway – know their days are numbered (which is why they are fighting so hard to derail or stall the clean energy revolution).
It’s tempting to believe that we can adapt to all these changes with better technology. And it’s certainly true that better technology is a powerful force. One clear example: the incredible decline in the cost of renewable power in recent years. Twenty years ago, when I started writing about climate change, fossil fuel executives argued that we needed to keep burning fossil fuels because they were cheaper than renewable power, and access to cheap energy was important for economic development, especially in the Global South.
Now, that economic paradigm has been reversed. In virtually every part of the world, electricity generated by renewable power is cheaper than electricity generated by fossil fuels. As a result, the amount of electricity created by wind, geothermal and especially solar is increasing fast.
Here in Texas where I live – hardly a bastion of tree-huggers – as much as 70% of the power on the grid this year is coming from renewable sources.
Despite this progress, the clean energy revolution is still happening too slowly to stop the rising heat and extreme weather we are experiencing. In fact, global oil and gas consumption hit an all-time high in 2023 – not surprisingly, so did the level of climate-warming CO2 emissions.
Air conditioning is another example of the complexity of technological progress. When I talk with people about my book, “The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet,” I often hear some version of this: Yeah, the heat can be brutal. Good thing we have air conditioning!
AC is becoming a survival tool for many people in ever-hotter climates, but it is not a magic fix for a superheated world. More than 750 million people on the planet don’t even have access to electricity, much less AC. We are not going to air condition the ocean, which is full of mysterious and beautiful creatures which hundreds of millions of people depend on for sustenance. We are not going to air condition forests, which are key to maintaining biodiversity on Earth. We are not going to air-condition the fields where food crops are grown.
Our dependence on AC, in fact, masks the true scope and scale of the challenges we face.
In the end, addressing the climate crisis is not about building better technology. It’s much bigger than that. We need to rebuild our world. Fast-rising temperatures and more extreme weather are forcing us to rethink everything about how we live – where we get our energy, how we grow our food, how we build our cities, and, mostly importantly, who we vote for.
The sooner we stop clinging to the old ways and focus on building a smarter, more sustainable, more equitable future for everyone, the better off we – and every living thing on this planet – will be.
What has already been lost during the climate crisis is a tragedy. But what can be won in this fight is worth imagining too."

When Hurricane Ida battered Louisiana with catastrophic flooding and powerful winds in August 2021, more than 1 million people lost power. Then came the heat wave. Temperatures rose above 90 degrees Fahrenheit — a sucker punch to those sweltering in their homes, unable to turn on air conditioning as power outages stretched on for days.
It was the heat that proved deadliest in New Orleans, responsible for at least nine of the city’s 14 hurricane-related deaths.
The combination of a hurricane, heat wave and a multi-day power outage is a nightmare scenario, but it’s one set to become more common as humans continue to warm the planet, fueling devastating extreme weather. And it reveals an uncomfortable truth about the vulnerability of humanity’s ultimate protection against heat: Air conditioning.
Air conditioning is far from perfect. It gobbles up energy, most of which still comes from planet-heating fossil fuels, meaning it exacerbates the very problem it’s used to mitigate. Plus, it’s only available to those who can afford it, further widening social inequality.
But it is also a lifeline against increasingly brutal heat, the deadliest type of extreme weather. It allows people to live in places where temperatures push close to the limits of survivability and where extreme heat persists even at night.
Demand for AC is exploding, expected to triple worldwide by 2050, as global temperatures soar and incomes grow.
The problem is, without electricity, access to air conditioning is lost. And many electrical  grids are being pushed to a breaking point due to increasingly frequent extreme weather and soaring demand for cooling.
Weather accounted for 80% of major power outages across the US between 2000 and 2023, according to a report from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group. “Every aspect of weather is beating on the already vulnerable grid and really giving it a test,” said Jen Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central.
In the US, the aging grid was designed “for the weather of the past, rather than the weather of the future,” said Michael Webber, a professor in mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
The main threat is storms, which can bring down transmission wires and poles. But heat, too, is having an impact. If it’s really hot, the system works less efficiently. Webber compares it to how someone might feel running a marathon in the heat — “we just kind of break down.” The grid can also buckle under the weight of demand as everyone cranks up their AC at the same time to cope with high temperatures.
The number of major outages in the US — affecting more than 50,000 customers and lasting at least an hour — doubled between 2017 and 2020, said Brian Stone Jr., a professor specializing in urban environmental planning and design at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “Most of the increase is happening during the summer months, that tells me that these systems are not resilient,” he told CNN.
Surging demand for cooling during an August 2020 heat wave in California prompted the state’s main grid operator to cut power to hundreds of thousands of homes in rolling blackouts for the first time in 20 years.
In 2021, during the blistering heat wave that scorched the Pacific Northwest, power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
It is not just the US that is struggling. In June, when temperatures in southern Europe topped 104 degrees Fahrenheit, parts of Albania, Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro experienced hours-long blackouts as demand for electricity spiked.
Even short power outages can be dangerous. “If the grid goes out while there’s a heat wave, it goes from uncomfortable to deadly pretty quickly,” Webber said.
Heat can affect vital organs and cause heat exhaustion, heat stroke and even death. If the power goes out when it’s very cold, people can add layers, make fires and huddle together. “If it gets really hot, there’s only one way to cool, and that is with electricity,” Webber said.
The combination of a heat wave and power outages “is the most deadly climate-related event we can imagine,” said Stone.
He and a team of scientists explored the potential impacts of a heat wave coinciding with a multi-day outage caused by extreme weather or a cyberattack. Focusing on Atlanta, Detroit and Phoenix, they looked at exposure inside people’s homes, a major driver of heat-related illness during a power outage.
The figures were particularly stark for Phoenix. During a three to four-day heat event and  outage, half the city’s population — nearly 800,000 people — would require hospital treatment for heat-related illnesses, according to the findings. More than 13,000 would die.
A power outage in Phoenix causes a “very dramatic shift in heat illness,” Stone said, because the city’s climate is so extreme and people struggle to adapt. In an unfortunate irony, widespread air conditioning may actually make residents less resilient because they are so acclimatized to cooling in their homes and workplaces, Stone said.
Authorities in Phoenix say the city is well prepared. Kate Gallego, the city’s mayor, said Stone’s research was based on an extremely unlikely scenario. “The study does not account for any of the existing emergency response plans in place, or the fact that our electric grid consistently ranks among the most reliable in the country,” Gallego told CNN.
Arizona Public Service, one of the energy companies providing power in Phoenix, said it has robust plans in place to prevent large-scale interruptions and regularly maintains the grid.
But while the chances of a combined multi-day power outage and heat wave in Phoenix may be low, Stone said, it’s still possible and becoming more likely as the climate crisis worsens.
Drastically cutting planet-heating pollution is the best long-term defense against heat and extreme weather, but the world is already committed to several decades of rising temperatures, Stone said.
In the shorter-term, there are ways to limit vulnerabilities.
Making the grid more robust and resilient is one, Stone said. This includes repairs and upgrades that take into account the climate of the future. Expanding and modernizing the grid, including adding more power plants and ensuring a diverse range of energy sources, will help strengthen it too, Webber said.
“But we also need to acknowledge that those grids will fail, and they are failing with greater rate of frequency, and so we need to have back-up plans,” Stone said.
That means rethinking cities, where heat-trapping concrete, steel and asphalt have replaced trees. Designing urban areas to be greener and cooler “can really increase grid resilience without investing in the grid itself,” he said.
Climate Central’s Brady pointed to community solar projects, which can keep local power  on when the grid goes down. Babcock Ranch in Florida — “America’s first solar-powered town” — managed to keep the lights on in 2022 when Hurricane Ian barreled through, unlike nearby towns.
Making homes more efficient will also help, Webber said. Homes better adapted to extreme weather can help reduce electricity demand when temperatures soar.
Ultimately, “we’re vulnerable because we’ve built our lives around conditioned air,” Webber said, living in places where life would be impossible without it. The stress extreme weather is putting on the grid shows “climate change is here and we need to be dealing with it.”"
What’s at stake for the climate if Trump wins? ‘A catastrophic outcome’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/03/climate/trump-v-biden-climate-stakes/index.html,"What’s at stake for the climate if Trump wins? ‘A catastrophic outcome’
In the first week of a new Trump administration, President Joe Biden’s climate wins would get put through the shredder.
First to go could be the executive orders, including the one protecting 13 million acres in Alaska from oil drilling and another aiming to dramatically increase the number of EVs on the road.
He would pull America out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again) and could even nix the country’s participation in the global climate treaty itself – a promise among countries to prevent “dangerous human interference with the climate system.”
Over the weeks and months that follow, Biden’s new climate rules would be methodically rolled back: limits on tailpipe pollution and unhealthy emissions from power plants, and new safeguards on the oil and gas industry.
Trump’s actions could leave the United States isolated from key allies on a global crisis in its deciding moments. 2023 was the hottest year on record and the rising heat is pushing the world closer and closer to irreparable harm. The only way to minimize the damage is to rapidly deploy clean energy on a massive scale by the end of this decade, scientists and global energy groups say.
Instead, Trump is poised to sprint in the opposite direction.
“He has said he’s going to come back with a vengeance,” former US special climate envoy John Kerry told CNN. “It would really be just a catastrophic outcome.”
This vision of the future is based on interviews with more than a dozen people: industry analysts, public officials and insiders from the former Trump administration, some of whom are involved in Project 2025, a conservative strategy guide to reshape the federal government in the event of a Trump win.
But it’s also based on what Trump has said himself. He has railed against Biden’s climate policies at rallies and derided clean energy, vowing to push America back to fossil fuels. He has openly courted the oil industry at fundraising events, the Washington Post reported, promising regulation rollbacks in exchange for campaign cash.
“No one has done more damage to the American oil and gas industry than Joe Biden,” Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement.
Leavitt said if Trump were elected, he would give the oil industry “more freedom,” describing the planet-warming fossil fuel as “liquid gold” and (falsely) as “clean energy.”
“He will do that again as soon as he gets back to the White House,” she added.
While his first term was characterized by policy chaos often stymied by courts, Trump’s second term would be efficient, former Trump administration officials told CNN.
“We lost a fair amount of time early in the Trump administration because we weren’t as prepared as we would be for round two,” Mandy Gunasekara, former chief of staff of the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump, told CNN.
The lesson learned, she said, is to move with speed.
Trump’s circle of influence is more organized this time, focused on gutting key agencies that oversee environmental protection and unwinding most, if not all, of Biden’s marquee climate rules.
It could happen “very fast,” said David Bernhardt, who served as Interior Secretary in the Trump administration. Bernhardt, who is not involved with Trump’s campaign, speculated the former president “would essentially be directing, in many cases, a step back to policies that he implemented in the past,” adding the rollbacks could be done “in a matter of months, in many instances.”
While Biden is cementing a legacy as the most pro-climate president, Trump would work to unravel the progress, focusing instead on America’s fossil fuel “energy dominance,” several people told CNN.
Trump’s second-term energy policies could be summed up by three words he chants at his rallies, popularized by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 16 years ago:
“Drill, baby, drill.”
Slamming the brakes on EVs
Gas-powered cars and trucks account for the biggest chunk of the country’s climate pollution, and one of Biden’s biggest climate and economic policies is his push toward electric vehicles.
Democrats passed tax credits to help consumers defray the cost of an EV, and Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency finalized tailpipe rules that push the auto market toward fuel-efficient hybrids and EVs by the early 2030s.
Trump and Republicans have seized on those actions as a “mandate” for EVs, which Trump has referred to as “all-electric nonsense where the cars don’t go too far” and a “bloodbath” for American jobs. Trump has promised to undo the tailpipe rules if he is elected, though unwinding them could take months.
There are other ways Trump could delay the transition to EVs – some of which would hit voters’ pocketbooks.
His Treasury Department could slash the tax credits for purchasing EVs. Former Trump Department of Transportation official Diana Furchtgott-Roth, now at the Heritage Foundation, said the second Trump administration would likely also again try to roll back the federal waiver that allows California to set its own car pollution rules.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN his state will continue “maintaining that leadership” regardless of whether Trump is elected president.
“I don’t care what Trump says or does,” Newsom said. “We’re going to be that anchor, regardless of the prevailing winds in Washington, DC.”
But there are some winds of change that Trump will likely need to bend to.
Unlike the oil and gas industry – which is staunchly opposed to many of Biden’s climate policies, the auto industry is charging ahead with electric vehicles and wants to keep consumer subsidies to help drivers buy them.
John Bozzella, president and CEO of auto industry trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, told CNN he didn’t think repeal of tax credits or the Biden administration’s emissions rules was a “foregone conclusion.” In a statement to CNN, Bozzella pointed to fast growth in EV sales and US factories to build them.
“Things have changed quite a bit,” Bozzella said. “We’re moving decisively toward an electric future while providing customers a range of vehicle choices … but it’s important for America’s global competitiveness and our overall economic and national security that we stay on this path. That’s something both sides understand.”
License to drill
Biden and Trump both argue their energy policies would lower consumer costs and create jobs. But they offer vastly different visions on how to do it.
Many of Trump’s energy policies revolve around a simple idea: drill for more US oil to bring down gas prices. The former president has vowed to unleash a torrent of US oil. “Drill, drill, drill,” Trump said on Fox News in February. At times, he’s falsely suggested drilling alone will halve inflation and energy prices.
Energy analysts frequently point out this idea is a fallacy, because the price US drivers pay for gas is highly dependent on the global oil market.
Whether the country is in a drilling boom is governed by “what the price of crude oil is, how healthy the economy is,” Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN. “These things are outside of a president’s direct control.”
The US is already awash in oil; it’s producing more crude than any other country in history and has led the world in oil production for the past six years. To the dismay of climate activists, crude oil production hit record highs under Biden, and new records are likely to be set this year and next year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
But Biden has dramatically curtailed the federal land and waters the fossil fuel industry can drill on. Last year, the administration openly touted the fact it was offering the smallest number of offshore oil and gas leases in history – just three over the next five years.
The oil industry isn’t happy with that, and Trump is capitalizing on it, fiercely courting the oil industry in private fundraisers, promising to dramatically increase the amount of federal lands and waters for drilling.
“A critical component of his plan is expanding access, and we did that in the Trump administration, whether it was the leasing of ANWR, expanding regular lease sales,” Bernhardt, the former Trump Interior Secretary, said. “Those are the types of things I think you would almost certainly see come back.
By coming into office with a pro-oil agenda, would Trump be able to meaningfully increase US oil production?
“No,” said McNally.
Trump’s biggest impact would be “removing the risk of negative policy, rather than implementing policy that is going to measurably increase production,” McNally added.
‘Much deeper trouble’
Trump could gut some of Biden’s pollution rules, but he’ll have a much harder time killing Biden’s biggest clean energy policy – a sweeping climate law even Trump’s own party is benefitting from.
The Inflation Reduction Act, which contained the largest climate investment in US history, has spurred a deluge of clean energy projects and jobs in Republican congressional districts. CNN recently reported the vast majority of the $346-billion-worth of announced investments – nearly 78% – has gone to Republican congressional districts.
“The IRA is much stickier,” said Nate Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland and a former senior advisor to the State Department. “It’s much more deep-rooted than regulatory actions.”
And while the oil industry wants some IRA provisions gone – like a program that would eventually fine oil producers for large methane leaks – it is supportive of some of the law’s tax credits for hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture.
What experts are more concerned about is the damage Trump could inflict again on US leadership on the global stage.
The Project 2025 document from the Heritage Foundation recommends Trump should fully exit the United Nations treaty to confront climate change – a decision that would rock international climate negotiations and make it harder for a future Democratic administration to re-enter.
A senior Trump adviser told CNN there haven’t been any serious discussions inside the campaign over whether Trump would go so far as to pull the US out of the treaty. The campaign has also sought to distance itself from outside groups like Project 2025, stating that no policy is official unless it is coming from Trump or his campaign team.
Kerry, who led America’s climate delegation on the world stage for years, called the possibility “disastrous” and “very destructive to the overall process,” adding it could spur other countries to abandon their climate goals at a critical time.
If Trump makes good on that idea, “we’re in real, much deeper trouble than the challenges we already face,” Kerry said.

Where temperatures will climb to triple digits this Fourth of July,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/weather/july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate/index.html,"Where temperatures will climb to triple digits this Fourth of July
Follow:
Grills won’t be the only thing sizzling this Fourth of July as uncomfortable, potentially dangerous heat sets in for millions in the US.
This summer started off unusually hot and is largely expected to stay that way, as forecasts show only fleeting moments of respite in the weeks ahead.
Summertime heat will be in place for much of the Lower 48 for Independence Day as the US enters its hottest time of the year. But temperatures for two large sections of the country are expected to far exceed those typical of early July.
Heat will ramp up in parts of the West and southern US this week, culminating in temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal in California and Oregon on Thursday and 5 to 10 degrees above normal from Texas and Oklahoma to the Carolinas.
High temperatures in the 100s and 110s will hit parts of California’s Central Valley while desert areas in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will approach 115 degrees.
Sacramento — which just experienced its fourth-hottest June on record — could come close to its hottest Fourth of July with a high near 107 degrees Thursday.
Las Vegas could come within a couple degrees of its hottest-ever Independence Day when the mercury tops out around 112. Heat has been relentless for the city — this June was also its hottest on record.
While Thursday won’t be record-hot for Phoenix, temperatures in the city are expected to climb around 7 degrees above its normal high of about 107. Thursday is also likely to be the third day in a row where temperatures exceed the 110 degree mark for the city — a streak that will continue into next week.
Thursday will be very hot for parts of the West but even higher temperatures are expected to follow. Brutal heat will expand into much of the Pacific Northwest on Friday and keep temperatures sky-high across California and the desert Southwest.
Portland, Oregon, will swelter as temperatures climb into the mid-90s Thursday and soar to near 100 degrees on Friday — about 25 degrees hotter than normal.
The South will also bake Thursday, but it won’t quite reach the extremes the West will endure. High temperatures in the 90s will be widespread in the Southern states, with parts of Texas and Oklahoma set to reach into the low 100s.
Dallas will climb to around 101 degrees Thursday, likely marking the fourth day in a row of the thermometer hitting triple digits. Typically, the metro should have a high of around 94 for Independence Day.
Farther east, Atlanta should normally top out at around 88 degrees on the Fourth of July, but the city is expected to reach 94 degrees this time around. The heat comes after the city recorded 11 days in a row of temperatures at or above 90 degrees to the end of June and recorded its first 100 degree reading in nearly five years.
Humidity will make the heat feel even worse in the South, sending heat index values — how hot the air actually feels to the body — over 100 degrees for millions. Dangerous heat index values coupled with outdoor activity for the holiday could result in heat-related illnesses without the proper precautions.
In addition to the heat, Mother Nature will also provide her own Fourth of July fireworks.
Thunderstorms will rumble over portions of the Mississippi Valley and Midwest from the morning hours onward as a cold front digs southward across the regions. Thunderstorms are also possible from parts of the Ohio Valley to the Northeast.
As the day progresses, some severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly in parts of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas during the afternoon and evening. These storms could unload damaging wind gusts, hail, heavy rain and even a tornado or two.
Any storms that linger into the evening hours could disrupt fireworks displays. Rain may prevent organizers from launching fireworks and any lightning strikes will make it dangerous for large crowds to be outdoors.
Major fireworks shows in Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York City may have to deal with storms Thursday evening."

Hot and humid conditions are building over the Northeast – including parts of the I-95 corridor – marking the return of uncomfortable air for millions of people after a short reprieve earlier this week.
This sticky summertime air will also prime the atmosphere for potentially feisty storms when a cold front slices through the area later Wednesday afternoon and evening.
A level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from parts of Ohio and Kentucky to New York, New Jersey and Delaware, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City could all encounter damaging storms.
A few thunderstorms will develop by mid-afternoon in parts of Ohio and western New York and expand south and east. These storms could increase in both strength and scope as the afternoon progresses.
Any potent thunderstorms that develop will likely reach parts of the I-95 corridor by late afternoon or early evening. Damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall are the greatest threats posed by the strongest storms, but hail and an isolated tornado or two cannot be ruled out.
Any rainfall will ultimately be beneficial for the region, which dried out after being scorched by an intense heat wave last week. But flash flooding could result if heavy rain falls too fast, especially in low-lying or poor-drainage areas.
Some thunderstorms may initially develop separately from one another only to ultimately congeal and form powerful lines that deliver greater wind damage. Power outages may ramp up in this scenario, especially if damaging winds roar over densely populated urban areas.
The storm threat will largely cease during the overnight hours as thunderstorms push off the coast and out over the Atlantic.
A much-needed break from intense summer heat will arrive in the wake of Wednesday’s storms. Temperatures will return to near-normal levels for much of the northeastern US Thursday and persist into the end of the week."

Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people in the US.
So when will it end?
Forecasts for the coming weeks and months show exceptional heat is largely here to stay, with only fleeting periods of respite. And the sobering summer reality on a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution is the heat isn’t going anywhere – it’s only going to get more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise.
“Summers like the one we are experiencing now and the summer we had last year – which was the hottest on record – are going to become par for the course in the years ahead,” said Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists.
A sign of things to come
There will still be colder-than-average summers in the future, but climate change is making it likelier more summers will end up hotter-than-average, Dahl told CNN. And the fingerprints of a changing climate are already visible, even before summer has reached its hottest months.
This spring, hundreds of cities in the eastern half of the US experienced one of their 10 hottest Mays on record in what was another sign of a changing climate: dangerous heat seeping into typically cooler seasons.
Early season heat waves add to the danger of what’s already the deadliest weather threat because the body can’t gradually acclimatize, or cope better with the heat, Dahl explained.
Acclimation or not, the abnormally hot temperatures are also altering the perception of what’s hot. Temperatures through at least midweek will climb up to 10 degrees above normal in parts of the western and southern US, but that pales in comparison to last week’s roasting conditions.
Summer should be hot, just not this hot: Parts of the central and eastern US sweltered through temperatures 25 or 30 degrees above normal last week. The heat was so extreme Caribou, Maine, a town just 10 miles from the Canadian border, hit 96 degrees, tying its all-time record high temperature.
“This is not your grandmother’s heat, this is significantly different,” Dahl said. “This (heat) really isn’t normal and it’s measurably influenced by climate change.”
The hottest is yet to come
Forecasts for the next few weeks, the next month and the rest of the summer all show one trend clearer than anything else: hotter-than-average temperatures for large sections of the US.
Above average temperatures are expected into early July for a vast majority of the Lower 48 with the exception of states along the northernmost tier of the country, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center.
July is typically the hottest month of the year, but it is expected to be even hotter than normal this summer in almost every state.
Most of the East and parts of the Rockies are likely to be the most anomalously warm areas next month. This prolonged heat could be record-breaking.
Last July in Phoenix was the hottest month ever experienced in any US city. The city’s average July temperature – calculated based on both high and low temperatures for the month – was an astonishing 102.7 degrees.
Heat in Phoenix last summer wasn’t just extreme, it was long-lasting. Its longevity and dangerously high daytime and overnight temperatures took a toll on human health. The scorching July contributed to the deadliest year for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, since officials began keeping records in 2003.
Heat lasted well beyond July last summer for much of the US.
A series of unrelenting heat domes baked huge parts of the country with the effects of each worsened by the one before. Every heat dome that parked over part of the country roasted the ground, dried out soils and made subsequent temperatures even hotter.
This year looks to be no different. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected to extend through the summer and most of the fall, according to the CPC.
Warmer-than-normal falls aren’t nearly as dangerous as hot summers. But the cooler seasons only mask the lingering threat of extreme heat as long as global temperatures continue to rise, which scientists say can only be mitigated by dramatically reducing or phasing out planet-polluting fossil fuel use.
“The more we try to normalize (heat), the greater the danger we have of taking our eye off the ball in terms of what needs to be done to address climate change,” Dahl said."

A dangerous heat wave is bringing sweltering temperatures to much of the US this weekend, including over parts of the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, a tropical system could develop this weekend through the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Here’s the latest:
• Millions of Americans under heat alerts: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency is in effect for Washington, DC, where the temperature skyrocketed to 100º F, the first time the city has recorded a temperature that high since 2012.
• Tropical system could develop: A new tropical system could develop quick this weekend on the heels of Alberto. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto’s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it could bring more rain to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast.
• Sizzling temperatures return to California: Heat alerts in California span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, more than 89,700 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year.
• ‘Catastrophic flooding’ in Iowa: On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to “catastrophic flooding.” In Rock Valley, all residences north of Highway 18 were being evacuated amid high floodwaters. There’s a level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Saturday over northern Iowa, and that corner of the state has seen an estimated 10-plus inches of rain based on radar. The heaviest rain is expected further east. And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith.
• Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods.
• Search for “more loss of life” in New Mexico fires: In New Mexico, authorities reported that at least two people died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for “more loss of life.” The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week’s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires.
Heat wave to intensify and expand this weekend
More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others.
The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index – or how hot it feels – to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will increase health risks by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night.
The nation’s capital could potentially hit 100 degrees for the first time in eight years.
DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said an extended heat emergency will remain activated throughout the weekend and into next week. The National Weather Service said widespread temperatures in the upper 90s and even triple digits will be possible in the city. The city officially recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed a state of preparedness declaration ahead of the potentially hazardous heat wave. An excessive heat watch has been issued for most of the region for Saturday, according to the National Weather Service, with dangerous heat possible and the heat expected to feel between 105 and 110 degrees.
The heat wave’s prolonged nature is a serious concern. New York City residents could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher this weekend into early next week. The stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. For the first time this year, the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the city.
Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday announced the opening of the state’s emergency operations center, which she said will monitor conditions and share resources with emergency management personnel across the state’s 62 counties. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said cooling centers will be open across the city.
Philadelphia has extended a heat health emergency through midnight on Sunday, according to the state’s Department of Public Health. Philadelphia has heat alerts in place through the weekend, with temperatures expected to feel close to 99 degrees.
New Jersey’s heat alerts are in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. It will feel around 100 degrees across the state Saturday and Sunday.
Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend.

Follow:
Nights are getting uncomfortably and dangerously hotter in India’s capital as people in the world’s most populous nation feel little respite from unrelenting temperatures.
Northern India has endured a scorching summer, with one part of Delhi reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May — the capital’s highest temperature on record.
But the stifling heat persists even after the blazing sun has set.
The city is cooling down by only 8.5 degrees Celsius at night compared to a 12.2 degrees cooling down in urban outskirt areas, a report published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) last month tracking urban heat stress in Delhi has found.
The warmer nights deprive people of rest and recovery from long hours of exposure to oppressive heat, particularly for people without access to air conditioning.
Bicycle rickshaw driver Sagar Mandal told CNN that he’s been getting fewer passengers because people opt for air-conditioned taxis over open-air transport.
“My body can’t take it, but I have to keep cycling. We are used to physical labor, we aren’t complaining about that. But this heat is not normal, something has to change,” the 39-year-old, who pedals people around the city, said.
“No one cares if we live or die, no matter who you vote for this is a problem no one can solve,” he said.
Nikhil Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver said his workdays are getting longer and tougher amid the heat.
“It doesn’t get any better at night, even at night I’m sweating, it rained a little last night but look how hot it is today, there’s no relief,” the 26-year-old driver said.
Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis, scientists have warned, heightening the health hazards of heat stress.
Studies have shown higher nighttime temperatures make it harder to fall asleep and reduce deep wave and REM (rapid eye movement), both critical to how well the body repairs and refreshes itself at night.
In the United States, for example, nights are warming faster than days in most of country, the 2018 National Climate Assessment found.
Mandal, the cycle-rickshaw driver said he has been sleeping on the roof of his home for some hope of cooler air but only for a couple of hours.
“I barely sleep these days,” he said.
Exposure to heat waves during pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, according to a 2019 study. Older adults may have higher heart rates and more physiological stress when sleeping in warmer temperatures. A 2008 Australian study even found deaths due to mental and behavioral disorders rose during heat waves, especially for older adults.
Power paucity, water woes and heat stress
Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities like Delhi because of the urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings. Areas with a lot of asphalt and dense concrete buildings absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with ample parks, rivers and tree-lined streets.
The hot days and nights are testing the limits of the country’s electricity grid and water supply, and the strain on resources is already making people sick.
“We’ve been living in this neighborhood for 40 years, but we have never seen a summer like this,” said 60-year-old Kalyani Saha, a resident of the Lajpat Nagar neighborhood of the capital city.
“There hasn’t been power for the last two hours, in the middle of the day that’s unbearable,” Saha told CNN, saying that power cuts also render their air-conditioning system useless.
“We get water only once a day, and it’s scalding hot, unless you fill up a bucket and let it cool off all day before using it, you can’t bathe in this water,” she said.
Saha also said her grandson has been ill for a week.
“They’re small, they can’t cope with this, this is not a human level of heat,” she said.
At least 40,000 cases of heat stroke have been reported in India since March, an official in the Ministry of Health told CNN Thursday, and at least 110 people have died across the country due to suspected heat stroke as well.
Dr Ajay Chauhan, in charge of the first of its kind heat-stroke unit at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohiya (RML) hospital says hotter nights mean increased stress on the bodies.
“When a person has a heat stroke, things progress very quickly, so without early intervention the fatality rate of heat strokes is very high,” Chauhan said.
Chauhan said people who work outdoors all day need time to cool down and recover but he concedes “that’s not been possible.”
At least 11 people have died as a result of heat strokes at his hospital since May 29 and on Thursday alone over 20 new patients were admitted to the hospital for various heat-related illnesses.
Over the past five decades, India has experienced more than 700 heat wave events claiming more than 17,000 lives, according to a 2021 study of extreme weather in the Weather and Climate Extremes journal.
Delhi recorded the highest numbers of homeless deaths in the last five years during the 9-day stretch.
Between June 11 and 19, Delhi saw 192 heatwave-related deaths among its homeless population, a record high compared with the same period in the last five years, according to a report from the NGO Centre for Health Development India.
“Almost everyone living on the streets reported experiencing sleeplessness,” the report said, adding that they suffered from several heat-related ailments.
Sarita Kumari has been sleeping on the streets of Delhi with her three children, and told CNN her three-year-old son has been running a high fever all week.
“We do have a house but there’s a lot of us and when the power goes it gets suffocating,” Kumari said.

Editor’s Note: Dr. Anna Bershteyn, PhD, is an associate professor of Population Health at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. Michael S. Diamond, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.
A first-of-its-kind climate science research program was just shut down in Alameda, California by local leaders, against the advice of city staff and experts who confirmed the safety and value of the research. The program intended to study how tiny particles called aerosols move in the atmosphere by spraying sea-salt mist on the flight deck of the USS Hornet Sea, Air and Space Museum. The research could help address one of the greatest areas of uncertainty in projecting our future climate and, potentially, inform future methods to combat heat waves.
The Earth’s atmosphere is full of naturally derived aerosols such as pollen, dust and sea salt from ocean spray — as well as aerosols from human-caused pollution. While greenhouse gas pollution warms the Earth by acting like a heat-trapping blanket, aerosol pollution can be thought of as a light parasol, partly shielding us from the sun’s rays. Aerosols cool the climate by reflecting sunlight directly and, even more powerfully, by brightening clouds. This effect can be seen from space as bright streaks trailing cargo ships, spewing pollution aerosols from burning sludgy fuels as they travel across the oceans.
Up until now, this aerosol “parasol” has masked around one-third of the warming effect from our greenhouse gas emissions. That is starting to change, however, because new laws have dramatically curbed ship pollution over the oceans and countries like China have reduced pollution on land.
Cutting aerosol pollution is a double edged sword; it has important and necessary public health benefits, but it also means the climate is set to warm even more. Exactly how much more is still unknown because quantifying how much aerosols influence clouds remains one of the largest unsolved problems in climate science.
Understanding the effects of aerosols on climate could help protect people from deadly heat. Around a billion people live in areas projected to get so hot and humid that being away from air conditioning is life-threatening.
All humans, no matter how physically fit, have limits to the heat we can withstand before internal body temperatures rise to deadly levels. Life-threatening, humid heat is becoming more common in many parts of the world, including Bangladesh, the Persian Gulf, and even parts of the US, such as Florida and Texas. In some of these places, air conditioning is scarce — and even where it is available, a power blackout or brownout could be a death sentence.
The Alameda program would have included research related to both general aerosol effects and to marine cloud brightening (MCB), an idea for brightening clouds with sea-salt spray instead of pollution. There are still key areas of research that need attention in order to determine if MCB would be feasible, which is why numerous scientific advisory reports have recommended research on rapid climate interventions like MCB, including small-scale field studies to advance our knowledge about how aerosols and clouds interact in the real environment.
The small sea salt studies that were halted in Alameda could have helped improve computer models that project how much reducing pollution aerosols will warm the climate, and in what situations MCB might save lives by cooling it.
Some might be wondering: Why bother with ideas like MCB when we know the only long-term solution is to stop emitting greenhouse gasses?
For starters, deadly heat is already here — hundreds died in Phoenix’s record-breaking heat last summer — and this summer is already hotter than last. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions has much-needed, but gradual effects on climate, meaning that even if emissions reduction efforts are highly successful, more warming will occur over the next few decades.
What’s needed is both an end to greenhouse gas emissions and protection from heat emergencies in the near-term. These aren’t conflicting goals, but two indispensable parts of climate planning.
What we’ve learned from crises like Covid-19 is that, if science isn’t yet mature when an emergency happens, we’re mired in confusion about what works and waste time grasping at straws like ineffective treatments.
In deadly heat waves — especially combined with power grid failures, which are expected in places like Texas, and in parts of the world with little air conditioning — local agencies might try MCB-like approaches in a desperate bid to reduce temperatures and save lives. But if this happens before scientists have time to properly study the science underlying MCB and similar interventions, the effects will be hard to predict — and far more likely to fail.
Undertaking the sea salt research as part of a museum exhibit and educational program in Alameda could have been a transformative opportunity to educate the public about climate science and the role of aerosols. Some Alameda residents argued against permitting the research with “not in my backyard” vigor, not because they don’t want to protect future generations from deadly heat, but out of fear of the unknown.
Many others spoke up in favor, seeing science and information as important for the community and the climate. Meanwhile, the City of Alameda performed its own environmental and health reviews and found  that the studies would not be harmful to people or animals near the site. Public education on aerosols and MCB is desperately needed — and would have been one of the best parts of the Alameda program if it had gone forward.
Small-scale sea salt research like that proposed in Alameda will not affect clouds or the climate, but it will improve scientific understanding of whether it’s possible to cool down areas experiencing deadly heatwaves. It’s possible that the research might prove MCB isn’t viable — which would be good to know so resources and time aren’t wasted during a climate emergency. On the other hand, it might show how to use MCB to save lives from a human-made crisis.
With so much at stake, shouldn’t we study every possible solution, and in the most open ways possible?"

‘You feel death at your doorstep but have no choice’: Extreme heat takes toll on outdoor workers
Follow:
The skin gets flush with fever, the breaths grow short, the heart races, dizziness sets in.
The helmet and goggles only make matters worse, trapping heat on the head and the eyes.
There’s little to no escape from sweltering temperatures for construction workers like Eva Marroquin, who cleans work sites in Austin, Texas, and has worked in the industry for 17 years.
“It damages our body when we work in construction; for example, I have suffered two heat attacks, one lately that made me very sick,” Marroquin, 50, told CNN via an interpreter in a video interview.
The blazing temperatures and searing sunlight have damaged her eyes, causing cataracts. Even worse, she says, she’s lost fellow workers who have died from heat-related injuries. Since 2010, she’s worked closely with the Workers Defense Project, an organization that advocates for protections for low-wage, immigrant workers in the Texas construction industry.
“You feel death at your doorstep, but we have no choice but to go to work,” she added.
Another punishing wave of intense heat has put much of the US in a vice grip this week, subjecting some workers to dangerous (if not deadly) conditions; disrupting small and large businesses; sapping away consumer spending and tourism; and taking a big bite out of economic activity.
It’s estimated that heatwaves result in a 1% loss of global economic activity, a GDP hit that’s forecast to grow to 3.2% by 2050, according to newly revised projections from Chris Lafakis, director at Moody’s Analytics.
“There’s a chronic physical risk,” he said. “These are things that occur over a longer period of time, they accumulate and become more costly and disruptive as time progresses and the temperature steadily increases.”
An economic letter published last month by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Williams College in Massachusetts estimated that by 2200, extreme heat will reduce the US capital stock, or the value of accumulated investment, by 5.4% and annual consumption by 1.8%, primarily attributable to labor productivity losses in construction (and, subsequently, fewer buildings being built).
“Extreme heat doesn’t just affect economic output today, it can have really long-lasting economic consequences,” said Gregory P. Casey, assistant professor of economics at Williams College and a co-author of the study.
And that doesn’t even account for extreme heat’s interaction with other types of climate change events, he said.
“For example, you get a natural disaster that destroys a bunch of buildings, and you’re needing to rebuild but this extreme heat is making it harder to supply new buildings,” he said. “There are these interesting interactions that we think will probably even increase the quantitative importance about this.”
‘Invisible’ disaster with unequal risks
The summers are indeed getting longer and hotter. The heatwave season has steadily grown in recent decades, climbing from an average of 53.5 days in the 2000s to 68.5 days in the 2010s and 72.7 days in the 2020s, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.
And, according to the EPA, heatwaves are occurring more often than they used to and delivering higher temperatures in the process, exacerbating the human and economic risks.
“Heat doesn’t get as much attention publicly, because it’s invisible in a lot of ways,” said Jenny Schuetz, an economist and senior fellow at Brookings Metro. “But more people in the US are exposed to high heat risk than to either floods or wildfires.”
Those risks aren’t shared equally: A 2021 study from researchers at University of California and Stanford University found that low-income workers experience five times as many heat-related injuries than those who are the highest earners.
“We forget that [air conditioning is] not an option for a lot of people,” she said. “Low-income households are more likely to live in older buildings that weren’t built with central air. Even if they have air conditioning, it’s expensive to run, and people can’t afford the extra utility bills, so they ration how much air conditioning they’re allowed to use.”
A lot of lower-income households are also more likely to have jobs that are exposed to heat, such as landscape gardeners, construction workers, delivery drivers and warehouse workers.
“Those are not white-collar jobs, and so many policymakers tend to forget that a lot of Americans just don’t have air conditioning in their workplaces, in their homes, in their schools,” she said. “And they really can’t escape it when we have these high-heat waves.”
The $15 to $17 an hour Eva Marroquin earns isn’t enough to fully support her family, so the mother of five supplements her income by cleaning houses, many of which are not air conditioned.
Slowing down small businesses
It’s barely just now summer, and heatwaves are already slowing down small businesses, according to Homebase, which provides payroll software to more than 100,000 small businesses, covering 2 million hourly workers.
The high heat has weighed on hiring, employee hours and businesses’ ability to stay open, as well as the amount of money they’re bringing in, said John Waldmann, Homebase founder and chief executive officer.
“Usually, there’s a pretty nice growth that comes in employment and hours worked at the start of the summer,” he said. “As businesses ramp up, particularly in the hospitality world, that looked far more muted this year than in previous years across the board. And in regions where heat was extreme, we actually saw those number dip.”
He added: “So there were fewer people working and fewer hours worked than we would expect to have seen.”
Especially after last year’s record-breaking summer, businesses aren’t remaining stagnant, he said. They’re trying to adapt by taking a variety of approaches, including installing shades to counteract the heat and save on the A/C bills and changing their operating hours, he added.
“I think anything that impacts small businesses is affecting the economy as a whole,” he said, noting how small businesses account for half the jobs in the country. “When we see changes in behavior in small businesses, like what we’re talking about here, usually that’s an early indication of how things are changing in the economy as a whole.”
In May, there was a 1.4% decline in the number of businesses open versus April in the Southeast, an area that faced high temperatures, according to Homebase data.
Ice packs for vaccines, water jugs for farmhands
This week Boston not only set a record-high temperature, but also had its heat index rocket to 108, breaking a 101-year-old record.
Katie Parent works as a mobile veterinarian, driving around Greater Boston and making house calls. For herself, the high heat is more of an inconvenience; the car’s hotter and she just needs to pack some extra water.
For her supplies and her patients, it’s more complex. The owner of the Doorbell Pet Doctor needs to ensure the vaccines and other temperature-sensitive materials she transports stay cool. She doesn’t have an in-house lab, so she needs to pack her shipments carefully and plentifully with ice packs and hopes that UPS ships them in the appropriate time.
Hot summers can be hard on pets, especially older dogs.
The heat dome that blanketed Boston and many northeastern states also stretched well into America’s heartland.
The Greer family farm in Princeton, Indiana, got a late start to putting the soybeans in the ground because of a recent bout of heavy rain. Now, the sixth-generation farm is having to contend with the excessive heat.
“It’s very hot today, it’s almost like we’re in a heatwave,” said Denise Greer Jamerson, who runs the farm with her 87-year-old father, Norman, and her 31-year-old son.
The summers have been getting hotter, she said, adding that the winters are milder and shorter. To help prepare her family and the handful of workers on the family’s 100-acre farm, Greer Jamerson bought everyone big, handheld water jugs to ensure they’re staying hydrated on these hot days.
The family has also implemented automatic timers to ensure the crops are being watered appropriately.
Despite temperatures rising to the mid-90s, it hasn’t deterred her father from getting out into the fields.
He just wakes up earlier.
“In this industry, you’ve got to get it done when you have that window of opportunity, because that’s the one thing that we cannot control is the climate,” she said.
‘We will close our doors in a heartbeat’
Caribou, Maine, the most northeastern city in the United States, saw its heat index — a measure that describes how heat feels to the human body — soar on Wednesday to a never-before-seen value of 103 as the temperature hit a record-tying 96 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
That was a good 22 degrees hotter than the high typically seen this time of year.
“It’s really, really hot outside … it’s sweltering,” said Tamara Lovewell, co-owner of the Ruska Coffee Company in downtown Caribou.
Inside, the coffee shop and café was still doing brisk business during breakfast and lunch. The family-run outfit decided to turn off the oven, the panini presses, the steam table and warming lamps and instead crafted a new limited-time menu of cold items such as sandwiches, wraps and salads.
“We don’t have A/C in the kitchen,” she said. “For now, we just changed out our menu, so we don’t have all of the hot equipment on to alleviate the extra stress on the staff.”
The heat pumps have been running strong for the front of the house but are not able to fully keep the hot air at bay. It was running a little warm inside on Wednesday, she said, but it was manageable for staff and guests.
Still, Lovewell said she’s keeping close watch on the temperature as well as everybody else to make sure folks are safe.
“If it gets too hot in here, we will close our doors in a heartbeat,” she said. “We will never subject anyone here to unnecessary risks.”

The planet is getting hotter fast. This is what happens to your body in extreme heat,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/09/health/what-happens-to-your-body-extreme-heat-xpn/index.html,"The planet is getting hotter fast. This is what happens to your body in extreme heat
Human-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense.
Scientists who study the role of global warming on weather say that every heat wave today bears the fingerprints of the climate crisis.
Climate change, driven primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is worsening global extreme weather in general, but much of that change is related to heat.
In the US, heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, and it will only continue to worsen as the world heats up from burning fossil fuels.
Here’s what happens to your body in extreme heat, what you need to watch out for and how to stay safe.
What happens to your body
Normally, your body is used to a certain range of temperatures, usually between 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. When your brain senses a change – either lower or higher than that – it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University’s school of medicine.
“There are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,” Linden said. “The pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.”
The second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat.
When you’re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn’t evaporate as easily – which pushes your body’s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic.
“The higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,”  Linden said.
High body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses.
Types of heat-related illnesses
Mild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body’s salt and moisture and can lead to  muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC.
A heat rash can also develop. That’s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases.
When your body’s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what’s known as heat exhaustion.
“In this case you’re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You’re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,” Linden said.
“This is the body’s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.”
A heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death.
“That’s where your body’s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,” Linden said.
Warning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC.
The hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said.
“So when somebody’s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that’s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.”
Who is most at risk
Elderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses.
The elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said.
“Very young (people) as well, because they’re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they’re less likely to get out of the heat if they’re starting to feel overheated,” Linden said.
Student-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added.
“In this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,” Linden added.
How to stay safe
When your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.
First, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. “If somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,” Linden said. “That means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.”
Putting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911.
“If you see anybody with any type of confusion, that’s an immediate red flag,” Linden added.
When it’s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities – especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids.
Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink water – as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water – or more – an hour.
“If you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,” Linden said.
Try to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov.  Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help.
When you’re home, fans can help, but don’t rely on them as your only way of cooling down – while it may feel more comfortable, they won’t help prevent heat-related illness.
“If you’re in a super hot room, if you’ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you’ve got a fan, and you’re able to mist yourself … then fans can be helpful,” Linden said. “Fans are not foolproof.”
Finally, make sure you’re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends – especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said.

"Fossil fuel use and emissions hit record highs as world struggles with deadly heat, storms and fires",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/climate/fossil-fuel-emissions-record-climate-intl/index.html,"Fossil fuel use and emissions hit record highs as world struggles with deadly heat, storms and fires
Follow:
The world consumed record amounts of oil, coal and gas last year, pushing planet-heating carbon pollution to a new high, according to a report published Thursday, shattering climate scientists’ hopes that global energy emissions may have peaked.
The growth in fossil fuels drove a 2.1% increase in energy-related emissions last year, pushing them above 40 billion metric tons for the first time, according to the report published Thursday by the Energy Institute.
The report paints a bleak picture of a world struggling to wean itself off planet-warming fossil fuels even as the impacts of the climate crisis become more intense and more deadly.
Brutal extreme heat is currently scorching swaths of the planet. A heat wave unlike any seen in decades is sweeping large parts of the US, which is also grappling with deadly wildfires, storms and severe flooding. Hundreds of people have died as temperatures rose to 120 degrees Fahrenheit during the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. And India is currently grappling with a deadly summer heat wave which has killed dozens of people.
The report also shows that even though the world is adding clean, renewables at record levels, global energy demand is growing so fast that fossil fuels are filling the gaps.
Last year was “another year of highs in our energy hungry world,” said Juliet Davenport, president of the Energy Institute. “Energy is central to human progress,” she added. “It is also now central to our very survival.”
Global consumption of oil, coal and gas rose by 1.5% in 2023, driven in particular by a strong growth in oil. Last year, the world consumed more than 100 million barrels a day for the first time, the report found. The US remained the largest oil producer, growing its output by 8% last year.
Overall, the proportion of fossil fuels in the 2023 global energy mix remained largely the same at 81.5%, down just 0.5% from the previous year.
Fossil fuel growth was particularly strong in developing economies, the report found.
India’s fossil fuel consumption was up 8% last year and, for the first time ever, the country used more coal than Europe and North America, combined.
In China, fossil fuel use soared to a new record high in 2023, up by 6%, as the end of its extended Covid lockdowns led to a rebound in fossil fuels. However, the share of fossil fuels in the country’s overall energy mix is declining, as China continues to add huge amounts of renewables.
The report does point to some positive developments.
Fossil fuel use in major advanced economies is likely to have peaked and is beginning to fall, it found. In the US, fossil fuels fell to 80% of total energy consumed. In Europe, fossil fuels made up less than 70% of the energy mix for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, driven by reduced demand and renewable energy growth.
Energy generation from renewables, excluding hydropower, was up 13% almost entirely due to a boom in wind and solar, according to the report, although the rise in renewables was not enough to match increased global demand for energy, which rose 2% in 2023.
“In a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged,” said Simon Varley, vice chair and head of energy and Natural Resources at the firm KPMG, which co-authored the report.
Dave Jones, global insights director at climate think tank Ember, who was not involved in the report, said it should be a wake-up call for governments to act. “The world is still as hungry as ever for energy. To turn the tide on fossil fuel use, renewables needs to rise much faster, whilst keeping an eye on use energy less wastefully,” he told CNN.
To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a target countries agreed to in the Paris Agreement in 2015, the world needs to roughly halve emissions by the end of this decade."

Editor’s Note: Mark Wolfe is an energy economist and serves as the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, representing the state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and co-director of the Center on Climate, Energy and Poverty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
Summer starts Thursday, and record-breaking temperatures are already cascading across the United States. Triple-digit temperatures have hit the western states, with the Northeast, Midwest and Great Lakes regions expected to see extreme heat waves this week.
Current US strategies for keeping families cool, including access to cooling centers — temporary shelters during heat waves — may have worked when temperatures were lower and the duration of heat waves was shorter, but in today’s climate, these outdated cooling methods are inadequate.
Weather-related deaths from extreme heat are more common than from those from hurricanes, floods, extreme cold and other natural disasters. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1,220 people die from extreme heat every year. And some experts think that these numbers understate the full extent of the problem because of a lack of consistent methods to record these deaths.
We need a full paradigm shift in policy to deploy the right solutions to the people who need them most.
The cost of home cooling has been rising steadily for the last 10 years, in part because families need to purchase more electricity to cool their homes as temperatures continue to rise. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) and the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate project that the financial burden to families of keeping cool this summer will increase by 7.9% across the United States to an average of $719 from June through September. That’s up from $661 during the same period last year.
Low-income families will be at greatest risk of falling behind on their utility bills this summer, and therefore of facing utility shutoffs and suffering dangerous health effects of extreme heat exposure.
The average energy burden for low-income households is about 8.6% of income, three times the rate for non-low-income households (3%). And according to the US Energy Information Administration, almost 20% of low-income families making less than $20,000 per year reported having no air-conditioning equipment in 2020. Increasing access to adequate cooling throughout the summer months for these families is imperative.
Low-income families will be at greatest risk of falling behind on their utility bills this summer, and therefore of facing utility shutoffs and suffering dangerous health effects of extreme heat exposure.
Mark Wolfe
As of now, only 17 states and Washington, DC have protections against utility shutoffs during the summer, and many of those protections are limited in scope to periods of extreme temperatures.
To make matters worse, funding for the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides formula grants to states to help struggling households pay their energy bills, has been reduced from $6.1 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024, leaving states with few options other than reducing assistance.
Congress must restore the $2 billion that was cut from LIHEAP back to the program this year. But, given that’s not likely, utilities across the United States should agree to voluntarily suspend power shutoffs during the summer.

They should also add bill payment assistance programs that provide a set of tiered discounts that reflect households’ abilities to pay. Several states have already implemented different levels of utility discounts with successful outcomes, including Connecticut, which just put into effect a program providing a discount on monthly electric utility bills of up to 50% for low-income families.
Long term, we need to invest in solutions that we know work and are cost-effective. Federal programs, like the longstanding Weatherization Assistance Program and the more recently passed Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program, can lead the way to helping low-income families stay safe in their homes during both the winter heating and summer cooling seasons. But they must be adequately funded to reach their full potential.
During periods of extreme heat, cooling is not just a luxury that provides comfort, but a necessary measure that helps families across all income brackets, and especially low-income families, stay safe."
A heat wave not seen in decades is helping to send temperatures soaring for most Americans,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/17/weather/heat-wave-east-us-climate-monday/index.html,"A heat wave not seen in decades is helping to send temperatures soaring for most Americans
Follow:
A record-breaking heat wave is sending temperatures soaring to dangerous levels in the Northeast and Midwest, but much of the US is suffering through sweltering heat.
Around 270 million people in the US will experience temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week as an impressive heat dome parks over the eastern US.
Hundreds of records could be tied or broken this week. Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they’ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center said.
Scientists have warned that heat waves will become increasingly severe as the climate crisis intensifies.
Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren’t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values – how temperatures feel to the body – into the low 100s.

An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston.
Temperatures soared 15 to 20 degrees above normal Monday afternoon and remained at elevated levels overnight. A few dozen temperature records fell as a result, including daily record highs in Chicago and Cleveland, and daily record warm low temperatures in places like Des Moines, Iowa. Temperatures will rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek.
Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven’t seen heat like this in about three decades.
“Last time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we’re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95°F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),” the local weather service office said on X. “That stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.”
Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols.
Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city.
Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar.
Heat domes like the one fueling this week’s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don’t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness.
“Warm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices – measurements of how hot the human body feels – in some areas.
Chicago residents could feel heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees.
The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don’t have A/C.
Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers. Extreme heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined.

The year’s most significant heat wave so far is expected to roast a large portion of the central and southern United States on Father’s Day Sunday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures, four days away from summer’s official start.
The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas.
The intense heat wave won’t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week.
Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last.
The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s.
The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday’s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 – or major – risk of heat-related impacts.
The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. “It will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren’t used to this kind of heat yet,” forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Sunday’s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service.
Some smaller pockets of Level 4 – or extreme – heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon.
Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined.
Persistent heat could break records this week
The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago’s weather service office.
The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said.
A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday.
Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits.
“Morning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
“The combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,” according to the center.
In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city’s urban core won’t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week.
The sweltering conditions will continue to shift into the eastern and northeastern US by Tuesday.

The biggest winners of Biden’s green climate policies? Republicans.,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/climate/clean-energy-investment-republicans/index.html,"The biggest winners of Biden’s green climate policies? Republicans.
When President Joe Biden’s massive climate bill passed Congress in 2022, Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina complained it was boondoggle.
The Inflation Reduction Act, which contained the largest climate investment in US history, would “throw money at woke climate and social programs that won’t work — including over $350 billion for ‘Green New Deal’ initiatives,” Hudson said in a statement after IRA’s passage.
But Hudson – now the head of House Republicans’ campaign committee – is one of the members of Congress whose district has benefitted the most from the climate law and its massive investment in clean energy.
About $12.7 billion in private investment has been announced in Hudson’s district since the bill passed, the second-highest amount in the nation. Much of it is from Toyota expanding a gargantuan car battery plant that has tripled in size since it was first announced. The factory will span the length of 756 football fields and will spur 5,100 new jobs, the company estimates.
Hudson isn’t alone. House Republicans uniformly voted against the IRA in August 2022 and have voted to repeal some of its biggest programs dozens of times, but their districts are disproportionately reaping its benefits.
The vast majority of the $346-billion-worth of announced investments – nearly 78% – has gone to Republican congressional districts, according to a CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“It’s much more Republican-skewed at the congressional district level than at the state level,” Trevor Houser, partner at Rhodium, told CNN.
In a green twist of irony, the deluge of cash into red districts could actually save the climate law from total repeal if Republicans and former President Donald Trump win later this year.
Hudson was measured in his criticism when CNN asked him if he would vote to fully repeal the climate law if Republicans win control. He told CNN he wasn’t aware of the specific numbers in his district, and said that instead of seeking a full repeal, he would seek targeted changes.
“I think the experience with the [Affordable Care Act] tells us that rather than try to repeal one big bill with another big bill, we ought to look at the individual policies and the ones that we think are hurting American people,” Hudson told CNN.
Republican districts are awash in climate investment
In states including Georgia, Arizona and Texas, House Republicans are seeing a deluge of cash and jobs flowing into their districts as companies use clean energy tax credits to construct factories to build EVs and their batteries, and as massive wind, solar, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects come online.
In Georgia’s 11th district, Rep. Barry Loudermilk has touted the construction of a massive EV battery factory by Hyundai and SK Battery America, which is projected to create more than 3,500 jobs. The factory comprises nearly 70% of the $7.4 billion that has flowed into his district.
“It’s an unbelievable advancement, the new battery plant is just unbelievably large,” said Loudermilk.
Nationwide, about $268 billion in announced investments has gone to Republican-held districts, compared with about $77 billion going to Democratic districts.
Democratic Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana has around $13.2 billion flowing into his district – the most in the nation. Carter’s district, which snakes from Baton Rouge to New Orleans, is benefiting from several companies investing in hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture – industries related to Louisiana’s proximity to oil and gas.
“Louisiana, once solely reliant on oil and gas extraction, has the workers and infrastructure to lead the nation in the green energy transition which will lead to good-paying careers at home,” Carter said in a statement, adding his state is “benefitting greatly” both from private and public investment from the law.
Republican districts round out the top five with the largest sums in private investment.  Hudson comes in at number two, and the remaining three of the top five districts are in Texas: Reps. Michael Cloud, August Pfluger and Randy Weber.
The big projects in each Texas district run the gamut from Tesla’s massive lithium refinery being constructed in Cloud’s south Texas district, dozens of wind, solar and battery storage projects, and sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen facilities.
The reason so much private money has flowed to Republican districts is simple, according to Rhodium’s Houser: They have more land.
“Republican districts tend to be more rural,” Houser said. “It’s very hard to build large industrial facilities in dense urban areas.” Comparatively, Rhodium and MIT’s data shows that retail sales of EVs and rooftop solar panels are stronger in Democratic districts (heat pumps are more popular in red districts due to their prolific use in the South).
In addition, Republican states have laxer labor laws and several states, including Georgia, have put together enticing state tax packages to lure big companies.
“That’s where the pro-business policies are,” Loudermilk said. “They’re going to areas that are welcome for growth and have limited obsessive regulation.”
Why Republicans may not kill the climate law after all
The cash advantage in GOP districts may ultimately protect Biden’s climate law, even if Republicans sweep the election.
“I think the odds of complete repeal, even in the Republican trifecta, are very low,” Houser said.
House Republicans have tried to repeal big pieces of the IRA several times, including voting to cut billions in tax subsidies. Those attempts haven’t gone anywhere in the Democratically controlled Senate.
“We’re seeing a number of elected officials who decided they would vote against the IRA, and now they’re seeing the benefits delivering for their constituents, they are celebrating those benefits,” White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian told CNN. “Because who wouldn’t celebrate more jobs, billions of dollars in investments in your community?”
Quillian said the White House takes the threat of repealing Biden’s climate bill “very seriously.”
“We take them at their word that they want to repeal this,” Quillian said. “Our job is to make sure that these investments land and then they stick.”

Despite their party’s repeal attempts, some Republicans are working closely with clean energy companies in their districts to ensure new factories and jobs stick around for the long haul.
“We are very well taken care of by our representatives in the Georgia government, and by our local representatives,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of public affairs and market strategy at QCells North America, which is building a $2 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in Loudermilk’s district. “Congressman Loudermilk has been vocally supportive of what we’re doing and he recognizes it’s going to take a lot of tools for these critical industries to succeed longterm.”
Several House Republicans CNN interviewed didn’t commit to backing a full repeal, but said they wanted to pare back elements of the law. For instance, Cloud, the Texas Republican whose district has seen nearly $9.8 billion announced investment, said he wants to put caps on the law’s clean energy tax credits, because the federal price tag has ballooned well beyond original estimates due to their popularity with businesses and consumers.
“Even the authors of the bill have said, that was kind of an oversight not to put a cap on,” Cloud said, adding that IRA’s vast subsidies are “distorting the economy.”
“I have talked to companies that have actually changed their business model to go after it,” Cloud said.
Loudermilk, the Georgia Republican, told CNN he’s intent on repealing parts of the IRA, concerned the law is “trying to force a technology before it’s mature enough.”
Some companies, aware of potentially shifting political winds, told CNN they’re making investment decisions in clean energy based on broader market demand.
“Incentives can be helpful but are often temporary or subject to changing political dynamics,” Susan Elkington, Toyota’s senior vice president of electric vehicle supply, told CNN in an emailed statement.
Rep. John Curtis, a Republican from Utah and founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, said that even though the GOP opposed the partisan reconciliation process used to pass the IRA, the bill contains many things that Republicans like.
“It’s a bit of a false narrative that you’re 100% in or 100% out on the IRA,” Curtis said. “I do think it’s a legitimate point that as these investments come into Republican districts, that makes it easier for Republicans to not necessarily support but see the impact of those.”
Curtis, who is running for US Senate in Utah, said he thinks if Republicans take control in 2025, they’d pursue more limited rollbacks to the law, rather than full-scale repeal.
Bob Keefe, executive director of clean energy group E2, said the law is already transformative for state and local economies.
“Those opportunities would not exist without the IRA, regardless of what opponents of the IRA would say about it,” Keefe said. “It just wouldn’t have happened. This is how you rebuild an economy.”
About this analysis: There are several data sets that track IRA investments in congressional districts, all of which differ slightly. CNN went with Rhodium and MIT data because it only includes projects that have at least entered final engineering and design or final site selection. It excludes projects where companies made initial announcements but then backed out of projects. This choice results in a higher likelihood the projects in our analysis will get built.

Follow:
Summer technically starts next week and will show the US what it’s capable of in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and without El Niño.
Prolonged, record-breaking heat is on the way for an area of the country that has largely avoided it so far, wildfire risks are rising in parts of the West and bathtub-warm water could fuel the first tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season.
Heat dome to bring intense heat wave for millions
Heat arrived in the eastern half of the country Friday, but it’s just an appetizer of what’s to come.
An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome builds Sunday over the East and expands to reach the Midwest and Great Lakes over the following days, ushering in the regions’ first significant heat wave of the year. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last.
This one will make temperatures skyrocket to levels hotter than even the hottest typical summer day.
Hundreds of temperature records could fall by the end of next week, both during the day and at night.
Temperatures will top out 15 to 20 degrees above normal over a huge portion of the eastern half of the country Monday afternoon, but surge even higher to reach 25 degrees above normal at times from Tuesday through Friday.
This translates to days of high temperatures well into the 90s for tens of millions of people who don’t typically bake in long-lasting heat.
Relief from the heat won’t be found at night, which is another symptom of a warming world. Overnight low temperatures aren’t expected to drop below the low 70s or upper 60s in many locations.
To make matters worse, humidity will work in tandem with extreme heat to send the heat index – how heat feels to the human body – to dangerous triple digits in parts of the East. Heat index values in the low 100s are possible as far north as Maine next week.
The health risks from heat will reach extreme levels for millions next week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and CDC. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined.
First signs of tropical trouble are brewing
The Atlantic hurricane season looks ready to awaken at the same time intense summer heat bakes a significant portion of the country.
There are two short-term risk areas that could produce the first tropical system of the year, and both are a little too close to the US coast for comfort.
An area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has the highest chance to become the first tropical system. There is also a small window and a low chance the same stormy pattern driving Florida’s rain could develop into a tropical depression off the Southeast coast before it gets swept out to sea this weekend.
Robust tropical moisture is swirling in the southwestern Gulf because of the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters.
The gyre’s broad spin and abundant moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific Ocean when other necessary factors – including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water – align.
That could be the case by midweek; the National Hurricane Center says there’s a medium chance a tropical depression could form in the Bay of Campeche in the southwestern Gulf. Most of the Gulf of Mexico is bathtub-warm, so if a tropical system manages to form it would have plenty of fuel to strengthen. If something does form, it’s likely to track north or northwest.
Regardless of tropical development, a surge of moisture like the one behind the deluges in South Florida will provide much-needed wet weather to parts of Mexico that have been baking under extreme heat and brutal drought for weeks.
But it will also raise the flood risk along the Gulf Coast, especially in areas soaked this spring.
Multiple days of rain are heading for the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama starting Sunday and continuing throughout the week.
Wildfire risk growing
Heat isn’t just making us sweat and giving hurricane season a boost – it’s also had a hand in several recent notable wildfires.
Fire activity is increasing gradually nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Almost a dozen large fires are burning in parts of the West and half of these started in recent days.
Hot, dry conditions in place since early in the month in the West will continue to increase wildfire risk and could worsen ongoing fires. Wildfire fuels like grass and plant life will continue to dry out during this time, making them more prone to fire ignition or spread.
Winds will also kick up in the region later this weekend and early next week. Gusty winds cause wildfires to spread quickly, as the Corral Fire demonstrated in California at the start of June.
Breezy conditions could also spell trouble next week for a small, but destructive fire in Arizona, about 70 miles northwest of Phoenix, dubbed the Rose Fire.
The fire destroyed at least 15 structures – seven of which were homes – along with at least a dozen vehicles, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said Thursday.
The fire had burned through at least 166 acres since igniting Wednesday, but was only 20% contained as of Thursday evening.

A surge of July-like heat is ushering in the hottest conditions of the year so far to the central and eastern US as a major pattern change unfolds.
Daily high temperatures will surge up to 15 degrees above what’s typical for June through at least Saturday and threaten dozens of daily high temperature records as sweltering heat in place over the West expands east.
And the heat isn’t dropping by for a quick visit, even if it ebbs in some places. There are signs it’ll stick around for the long haul as a predicted hot summer kicks into gear.
Parts of the West have been baking since a stifling heat dome set up over the region last week. One person died on Monday while hiking in Colorado National Monument Park in western Colorado, according to a news release from the National Park Service. Temperatures were around 90 degrees.
Now, some of that heat and an additional push of hot air from Mexico are enveloping more of the US as the jet stream – a river of fast-moving air in the upper atmosphere that separates warm air from cold air – slowly shifts north over the central and eastern states.
Heat will ramp up Thursday from the Plains to the East Coast, marking a considerable change from seasonably cool conditions earlier in the week.
Highs in the upper 80s and 90s will be common from the Plains and Midwest to the Southeast, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Several cities will experience the warmest day of the year so far Thursday, but temperatures will be short of record levels.
Humidity will build alongside the heat and make conditions feel even more uncomfortable.
The thermometer has yet to climb out of the low 90s in St. Louis this year, but that will change Thursday with a high around 96 degrees. The heat index – how air feels to the human body – could approach triple digits.
Temperatures will warm even more Friday for much of the Gulf Coast, Southeast and mid-Atlantic as hot air surges north. Highs well into the 90s will stretch from Texas through Georgia and the Carolinas north into parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
Friday will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC. The high temperature could approach the mid-90s, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal.
Heat will be at its worst by Saturday for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast but ease slightly for areas farther north with the passage of a cold front.
Atlanta is expected to top out near 99 degrees on Saturday, which would be a temperature record for the date and the hottest reading of the year so far. If the city were to hit 100 degrees it would be the first triple-digit temperature there since August 2019.
Highs in the upper 90s and low 100s could also break Saturday’s high temperature records in multiple other Southeast cities including: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Expansive heat will build once again for much of the central and eastern US on Sunday as the jet stream settles near the US-Canada border and high pressure builds in the upper atmosphere.
Anyone hoping for relief is out of luck. A long-lasting heat dome will build early next week in the East and send temperatures soaring even higher."
El Niño is dead. Here’s what to expect in the coming months,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/weather/el-nino-la-nina-summer-forecast-climate/index.html,"El Niño is dead. Here’s what to expect in the coming months
Follow:
El Niño has officially come to an end and the ripples from its demise will shake up weather around the globe.
El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean – has gripped the planet since the start of last summer. It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events.
With El Niño out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Niña.
For now, neither La Niña nor El Niño are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Niña builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season.
Here’s what a summer without El Niño and a budding La Niña could have in store.
Sweltering summer, active Atlantic
La Niña summers following strong El Niño winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer could be no different, even before La Niña is entrenched.
Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country.
The transition to La Niña isn’t the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
Along with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains.
Dryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun’s energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil.
The loss of El Niño will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season.
El Niño tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Niña does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Niño holding them back. El Niño also won’t be around to curve many storms away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season.
The Atlantic Ocean’s record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive.
The Atlantic is also not the only ocean that’s steamy. Over the past year, El Niño helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Niña may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world’s oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year.
But that’s not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world’s excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them.
El Niño’s lasting impact
El Niño arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime.
Most notably, El Niño helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world’s hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported.
Global ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then.
Despite records starting before El Niño arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans.
The natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer.
El Niño likely had a hand in hot and dry conditions in northern South America that brought the Amazon River to record-low levels in October, the US Lower 48’s hottest ever winter and severe drought in large portions of central and southern Africa this winter.
Parts of Africa’s east coast typically record more rain during El Niño events, but excessive rainfall unfolded to devastating, deadly effect in Kenya in April and May.
California and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Niño, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast.
Further research is needed to determine El Niño’s full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern’s reach.

Follow:
It’s only June, and Americans across parts of the US South and West have already experienced record heat waves. Extreme heat weather events are expected to affect more than 60 million people across the US this summer.
This comes as last summer was officially deemed the hottest recorded. The rate of emergency department visits related to extreme heat increased significantly in 2023 compared to the previous five years, with nearly 120,000 visits due to heat-related issues, according to a recent study published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Reports.
With summer temperatures on the rise, what should people know about the dangerous condition of heatstroke? What are the symptoms, and how can others recognize if someone needs help? What are other types of illnesses associated with extreme heat? Especially those most susceptible to the ill effects of high temperatures?
To find out how to handle the heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
CNN: What should people know about heatstroke? What is it, and what are its symptoms?
Dr. Leana Wen: Heatstroke is a medical emergency. It must be treated immediately because it can quickly become fatal.
The body normally has the capacity to control and regulate its temperature. Heatstroke occurs when this mechanism is overwhelmed. The body’s temperature rises rapidly, and the person can’t cool down.
Your internal temperature can rise rapidly to 106 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in 10 to 15 minutes. If that happens, a person may become confused and dizzy, and feel faint. They could have slurred speech and lose consciousness. They may even start to have seizures and abnormal heart rates.
If someone around you is having these symptoms, they need to go to the hospital right away. Bystanders should not hesitate to call 911.
CNN: Is there anything else bystanders can do to help that person while help is on the way?
Wen: Move the person into a shaded, cool area. Place cold, wet cloths or ice packs on the neck, armpits and groin, and soak clothing with cold water. Make sure to stay with that person until emergency service workers arrive.
CNN: Are there less severe forms of heat-related illnesses?
Wen: Yes. Before someone reaches the point of having heatstroke, they may have heat exhaustion. Symptoms include nausea, tiredness, dizziness, headache, heavy sweating and cool, clammy skin.
It’s crucial to move to a cool place right away. Loosen your clothes and take a cool bath if possible; if not, put wet cloths on your body. Watch for worsening symptoms, such as feeling faint and throwing up, and seek help if these occur or if you are no better in an hour.
People engaging in physical activity also may have heat cramps, where they have painful muscle spasms in hot weather. They should stop exercising and drink water or an electrolyte solution.
CNN: Are there other types of illnesses associated with extreme heat?
Wen: Yes. There are actually two major effects of extreme heat. The first is what we’ve spoken about, which is the high temperatures directly impacting the body and causing it to overheat.
The second is caused by high temperatures exacerbating an underlying medical condition. Extreme heat puts strain on organs, including the heart, lungs and kidneys. Researchers estimate that the interaction between heat and cardiovascular disease was either a direct or contributory cause of 1 in 4 heat-related deaths. And heat extremes can worsen health risks from chronic conditions, including diabetes and some mental health diagnoses.
CNN: Who are the most susceptible to ill effects of high temperatures?
Wen: Extreme heat can affect everyone, but there are three groups of people who are the most susceptible to its ill effects.
The first are the very young and the elderly. Both groups have less physiological reserve and may have more problems regulating their body temperatures. Young children also may not be able to report how they are feeling. Both groups are also at higher risk of dehydration.
The second group includes those people with chronic medical conditions. Certain medications may interfere with the body’s ability to adapt to changes in temperature. Extreme heat puts pressure on organ systems, thereby exacerbating underlying conditions.
The third category encompasses those people who have occupational exposure or socioeconomic constraints that increase their exposure to heat. This category includes people who must work outdoors and those experiencing homelessness or otherwise do not have access to cool spaces in their residence.
CNN: What steps should people in these vulnerable groups take if high temperatures are forecasted?
Wen: Everyone should take additional precautions when heat advisories are issued. Even before temperatures reach the point of triggering these advisories, those who are elderly, very young and who have underlying medical conditions should try to limit their time outdoors during the hottest times of day. Try to exercise early in the mornings or in evenings. If you have to be out during the day, find shade when possible. Make sure to stay hydrated.
Those around vulnerable individuals can help them to stay safe by monitoring the amount of time they are spending outdoors when it’s hot outside and watching for any concerning symptoms. And never, ever leave children, older adults or pets unattended in a car; the temperature inside the car heats up extremely rapidly and can be fatal.
People who have jobs where they must work outdoors should use caution. They should keep well-hydrated, use good sun protection, try to seek shade and cool off in air-conditioned spaces when they are not working if possible. Those experiencing homelessness or who otherwise do not have access to air-conditioned spaces should seek out local resources such as cooling centers and temporary shelters during heat waves.
Extreme weather events are a time when we all need to watch out for people around us. Keep a close eye on children and be sure to check up on elderly neighbors and others in our communities who may need assistance."

A dangerous heat wave is expanding into new areas of the West and lingering in others Friday, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and a serious risk of heat-related illness.
The searing heat has already taken its toll. Since last weekend, multiple people in different parts of the US have died or have been hospitalized due to heat-related illnesses.
The worst of the heat peaked Thursday for much of California and the Southwest, but unseasonably hot conditions will stick around in these areas and expand into the Pacific Northwest at least through the weekend.
Heat alerts are in effect for more than 16 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Most will last through Friday but alerts in Las Vegas and Death Valley, California, last into Saturday.
Several notable temperature records were broken Thursday in California, Arizona and Nevada.

What is a ‘heat dome’?
In California, a high of 122 degrees in Death Valley broke a daily record set in 1996. And in Fresno, a 121-year-old record was tied Thursday when the city maxed out at 107 degrees.
Phoenix recorded its first high of 110 degrees or more this year when thermometers topped out at a daily record-setting 113 degrees Thursday.
Las Vegas soared to 111 degrees Thursday, the earliest in the year the city has reached the mark, breaking the daily record of 110 degrees set in 2010.
Several people across US have died from heat-related illnesses
Six people believed to be migrants have died because of the heat in the past week along the US-Mexico border from southwestern Texas to New Mexico, according to US Border Patrol and the Sunland Park, New Mexico, fire department.
Four people died “from heat stroke and dehydration” while triple-digit temperatures baked the area last weekend, the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector said. Two more people were discovered in a desert area about six miles from the border in Sunland Park and were pronounced dead Wednesday, Sunland Park fire chief Daniel Medrano told CNN.
Sunland Park is around 10 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, along the New Mexico-Mexico border.
Excessive heat is the leading weather related killer in the US, according to the National Weather Service.
“This is especially true in the urban centers, where population density, the urban heat island, and building construction exacerbate the effects of excessive heat,” the weather service says. “A combination of high heat and humidity can lead to heat related illness, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.”
In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George’s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man’s death, which was the state’s first heat-related death of the year, were not released.
Heat proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California’s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and “hot summer conditions,” according to CAL Fire’s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries.
Phoenix emergency responders on Thursday say they hospitalized 11 people due to heat exhaustion while they were attending a Donald Trump rally at the Dream City Church.
With the risk of heat-related illnesses increasing for millions across the country, officials in several states are trying to keep residents safe during the smoldering heat. In California, cooling centers have been set up for those affected by triple-digit heat. As Texas contends with both severe storms and excessive heat, a state disaster declaration remains active.
Hazardous heat expected into weekend
Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal and warm nighttime lows will make it difficult for those vulnerable to extreme conditions to be able to cool off.
The Las Vegas metro area is at “extreme” risk from the heat through Saturday, according to a scale from the National Weather Service that gauges heat’s potential impact on people’s health. The highest level on the heat risk scale means residents without enough cooling and hydration will be impacted, and “impacts are likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.”
Several more large metro areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas will face a “major” Level 3 of 4 heat risk.
Summerlike heat will expand north and east Friday and reach the Northwest and parts of the Rockies. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend.
While it won’t be record-breaking, Seattle could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday, 10 degrees warmer than what’s typical for early June.

A searing heat dome will reach peak intensity Thursday afternoon and usher in the hottest day of the year so far for millions in the western US.
Temperatures Thursday topped out up to 25 degrees above what’s normal for the time of the year, making it feel like a hot July day in many locations.
Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal.
A robust heat dome – a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks – is driving this prolonged, unseasonable heat.

The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off. Relief from the heat won’t be found at night, either – another symptom of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 18 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. A majority of these warnings, which are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service, remain active through Friday.

More than a dozen daily high temperature records fell earlier this week in the West as the heat dome strengthened. A few dozen more could be broken through the weekend.
Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day’s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week.
Phoenix sizzled Wednesday but fell just short of its first 110-degree day of the year, a threshold it blew past Thursday as it soared to 113 degrees, also smashing the city’s previous record for the day by 2 degrees. High temperatures hit 111 degrees in Las Vegas, tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city.
Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, clocked in with a temperature of 122 degrees, topping a daily record of 121 degrees it set back in 1996. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn’t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June.
Triple-digit temperatures will persist in California’s Central Valley into the weekend with 110s sticking around in desert areas of California, Nevada and Arizona.
Summerlike heat will expand northward Friday and reach the Northwest. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend.
While it won’t be record-breaking, Seattle will contend with high temperatures in the upper 70s Friday and could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday. Highs like these are 10 degrees warmer than what’s typical for early June.

Follow:
The planet just marked a “shocking” new milestone, enduring 12 consecutive months of unprecedented heat, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service.
Every single month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world’s hottest such month on record, Copernicus data showed.
The 12-month heat streak was “shocking but not surprising” given human-caused climate change, said Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, who warned of worse to come. Unless planet-warming fossil fuel pollution is slashed, “this string of hottest months will be remembered as comparatively cold,” he said.
Copernicus released its data the same day as United Nations Secretary General António Guterres made an impassioned speech in New York about climate change, slamming fossil fuel companies as the “godfathers of climate chaos” and, for the first time, explicitly calling on all countries to ban advertising their fossil fuel products.
Guterres urged world leaders to swiftly take control of the spiraling climate crisis or face dangerous tipping points. “We are playing Russian roulette with our planet,” he said Wednesday. “We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell.”
As temperatures surge, global climate commitments are “hanging by a thread,” he warned.
Copernicus’ data showed each month since July 2023 has been at least 1.5 degrees warmer than temperatures before industrialization, when humans started burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels.
The average global temperature over the past 12 months was 1.63 degrees above these pre-industrial levels.
Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries agreed to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. While this aim refers to warming over decades, rather than a single month or year, scientists say this breach is an alarming signal.
“This is a harbinger of progressively more dangerous climate impacts close on the horizon,” said Richard Allan, a climate professor at the University of Reading in the UK.
The news comes as the western US is experiencing its first heat wave so far this summer with temperatures soaring into the triple digits. But unprecedented heat has already left a trail of death and destruction across the planet this spring.
Dozens have died in India over the past few weeks as temperatures pushed toward 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit); brutal temperatures in Southeast Asia have caused deaths, school closures and shriveled crops; and as heat surged in Mexico, howler monkeys dropped dead from trees.
Hotter air and oceans also fuel heavier rainfall and destructive storms like those that have battered the United States, Brazil, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates, among other nations, this year.
The recent heat offers “a window into the future with extreme heat that challenges the limits of human survivability,” said Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. “It is vital people understand that every tenth of a degree of warming exposes more people to dangerous and potentially deadly heat,” he told CNN.
“Extreme events turbocharged by climate chaos are piling up, destroying lives, pummeling economies and hammering health,” Gutteres said.
Humanity is having an outsized impact on the world, he said, likening it to the meteor that began the process of wiping out dinosaurs 66 million years ago.
“In the case of climate, we are not the dinosaurs,” Guterres said. “We are the meteor. We are not only in danger. We are the danger.”
An even hotter future
Global temperatures are expected to start dropping below record-breaking levels in the next few months as El Niño — a natural climate phenomenon that tends to boost the planet’s average temperature — weakens.
But that won’t mean an end to the long-term trend of rising temperatures as humans continue to burn planet-heating fossil fuels. “While this sequence of record-breaking months will eventually be interrupted, the overall signature of climate change remains and there is no sign in sight of a change in such a trend,” Buontempo said.
Guterres’ speech also referenced new data released by the World Meteorological Organization, which found a nearly 86% chance that at least one of the years between 2024 and 2028 will break the hottest-year record, set in 2023.
The WMO also calculated a nearly 50% chance that global average temperatures over the entire five-year period between 2024 and 2028 would be more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. That would bring the world closer to breaching the longer-term 1.5-degree limit at the heart of the Paris Agreement.
Guterres laid blame for the climate crisis firmly at the doorstep of fossil fuel companies that “rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies,” he said.
These companies have spent billions of dollars over decades “distorting the truth, deceiving the public and sowing doubt,” he added. He called on every country to ban fossil fuel ads, similar to advertising bans implemented around the world for other products that harm human health, such as tobacco.
“We are at a moment of truth,” he said, adding that the battle for a liveable planet would be won or lost in this decade.
He called on world leaders to take immediate action, including huge cuts in planet-heating pollution and an immediate end to any new coal projects. He pushed rich countries to commit to quitting coal by 2030, reducing oil and gas by 60% by 2035 and increasing the flow of funding to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable nations.
“We cannot accept a future where the rich are protected in air-conditioned bubbles, while the rest of humanity is lashed by lethal weather in unliveable lands,” Guterres said."

A brutal heat dome is ramping up and sending temperatures to dangerous levels in California and the West in what is the region’s first significant heat wave of the year.
And heat hasn’t peaked yet. July-like high temperatures will top out at 20 to 25 degrees above normal in multiple Western states this week and could break several daily record high temperatures. Thursday will be the hottest day of the week for millions of people.
The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off. Relief from the heat won’t be found at night, either – another symptom of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
The extreme heat already turned deadly over the weekend with worse to come.
Excessive heat warnings are in effect for nearly 19 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah and South Texas. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected.
The soaring temperatures are being caused by a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts.
SO HOT: The planet has just lived through a ‘shocking’ 12-month streak of record heat. It’s set to get worse
The intense heat began Tuesday in parts of California and the West. Sacramento, California, hit triple digits for the first time this year while Las Vegas ended up just a degree shy of its hottest temperature of the year so far. Numerous daily records were also broken in Texas.
Temperatures will soar higher on Wednesday across a larger portion of the Southwest. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week.

Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in California’s Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California’s desert regions.
Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, will likely reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn’t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June.
Phoenix will likely hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday, even though the city doesn’t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, likely tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city.
Summerlike heat will also send daily high temperature records tumbling. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day’s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week.
By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east.
Deadly heat on the US-Mexico border
Dangerous heat isn’t new for the far southern US. Brutal heat in Mexico crept north into southern Texas earlier this spring and has been unrelenting for weeks. Several cities along the Texas-Mexico border experienced their hottest May on record.
The triple digit temperatures at the border proved deadly last weekend after US Border Patrol agents said four migrants died “from heat stroke and dehydration.”
The deaths were part of “several emergencies” involving heat-related illnesses last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. The sector includes portions of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas.
Heat is the deadliest weather threat in the US. It kills more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to the National Weather Service.
High temperatures in the area were about 5 degrees above normal from last Friday through Sunday, but are likely to climb to 10 degrees above normal Thursday and Friday.

Dangerous heat will get underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of California and expand its reach into more of the Southwest by Wednesday and as a heat dome parks over the West. It will then reach the Pacific Northwest by late-week. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week.
Temperatures will soar into the upper 90s and low 100s Tuesday in California’s Central Valley – including where the Corral Fire is burning near Tracy.
Sacramento is forecast to hit triple digits Tuesday for the first time this year. California’s capital typically hits this threshold in early June, but last year it didn’t happen until the end of the month.
Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in the Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California’s desert regions.

Phoenix will likely have hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday even though the city doesn’t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, more than three weeks earlier than the city typically exceeds this threshold.
The early summerlike heat will threaten daily high temperature records across a significant portion of the West this week.
Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day’s high temperature record could fall.
By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east.
Fire danger will also rise while the heat is at its peak.
Sizzling temperatures and low levels of humidity will dry out short-fuse fuels such as grasses and brush, making them more prone to burn. Breezy winds will develop at times, especially in California into midweek. The combination of these factors will make it easier for fires to ignite and spread.
Corral Fire blazing in California’s Central Valley
The Corral Fire has consumed more than 14,000 acres of land in California’s San Joaquin county since it ignited south of Tracy Saturday afternoon.
Residents were ordered to evacuate over the weekend as the fire – initially fueled by gusty winds and dry, hot conditions – threatened communities.
Firefighters gained an upper hand as winds eased Sunday and Monday and the blaze was 90% contained by Tuesday morning, according to CAL Fire.
Evacuation warnings were lifted Monday evening as containment increased, according to CAL Fire. Officials urged residents to remain vigilant and be ready for potential changes to the fire risk level.
Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the fire, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said.
A section of I-580 was closed in both directions over the weekend as the fire’s thick smoke enveloped the roadway. All lanes were reopened Sunday night, according to the California Department of Transportation.
The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CAL Fire.
Gusty winds up to 30 mph are possible Tuesday, which could complicate ongoing containment efforts. Temperatures will also surge well into the 90s from Tuesday through the weekend. An excessive heat warning is in effect for the region from Tuesday through Thursday.

There’s no fresh water in the slums of Delhi’s Chanakyapuri neighborhood. It’s 49.9 degrees Celsius, or 121 Fahrenheit – the hottest temperature on record.
The sun belts off the tin roofs of the shanties. Desperate people wait for drinking water to be delivered.
When it arrives, there’s chaos.
Dozens of people run to the truck, some even climbing on top of it to throw pipes in, pushing in to get their containers filled with water. It’s first come first served, and many people miss out.
Mother-of-six Poonam Shah is one of those people.
“There are 10 people in my family – six kids, me and my husband, my in-laws, relatives come over sometimes – can we all bathe in one bucket of water?” she asks.
Today her family may not even have one bucket. Poonam was working her street food stall when the water truck arrived. She tried to run back for it – but it was too late, the water had run out.
“What are we supposed to do? There’s no water. I work in a shop, there’s no water there. But forget about the shop, we don’t have water for our kids.”
She’ll now look to buy water – it’ll cost up to half of the $3 she usually earns in a day selling samosas and other snacks.
As record heat grips northern India, the Delhi government has been forced to ration these free water deliveries. Previously, Poonam’s neighborhood received two to three tanker deliveries per day. Now it’s just the one.
Temperatures in Delhi have been hovering above 40 degrees Celsius over the last week and on Tuesday they hit an all-time high of 49.9 degrees Celsius in one area of the capital, according to the Indian Meteorological Department.
At least one death has been reported in the city so far, and dozens more across the country.
At Ram Manohar Lohiya (RML) hospital in Delhi, a heatstroke unit with cold immersion tanks is treating more and more patients suffering extreme heatstroke, exhaustion and dehydration.
The hospital’s ice baths and air conditioning can help a handful of the millions of people who have no choice but to brave the Delhi heat to earn a living, but only if they get to hospital quickly.
“The mortality rate of heatstroke is very, very high, it is close to 60% to 80%,” Dr Ajay Shukla, medical superintendent of the hospital, told CNN. “People can survive if they get immediate and very early medical care and that involves rapidly cooling the body.”
“If people get that rapid cooling, they stabilize, they survive. But if they get to the hospital late and the intervention is late, the mortality rate is so high. We’re unable to save them if they come to us late.”
The patient who died in Delhi had been admitted to RML hospital. He was a 40-year-old migrant laborer, and like many working outdoors in the harsh sun, he succumbed to the heat.
“He was working in a factory… he was working in an area where there was no cooling, a very small congested area with a tin shed so there were multiple workers inside,” Dr Shukla said, adding that it was too late by the time he arrived at the hospital.
The man’s name has not been released, for privacy reasons.
Most of the hospital’s heatstroke patients are from poorer communities, where working people have no choice but to spend long stretches out in the summer sun.
Kali Prasad sells water and lemon juice outside the India Gate. Each day he pushes his water cart to the famed spot, from his home some eight kilometers (five miles) away.
“The heat has risen drastically over the last five to 10 days, it’s very hot, people aren’t even coming here because of it,” he said.
He says he has no choice but to stand all day under the scorching sun, as there is no one else to provide for his wife, children and parents.
In recent years, the summer heat has come earlier, temperatures have risen higher and higher, and heatwaves have lengthened.
Northwest and central India have been experiencing maximum temperatures above 42 degrees Celsius with some towns even crossing the 50-degree mark, according to the Indian Meteorological Department.
The trend is “a clear manifestation of the escalating impacts of climate change,” says Farwa Aamer, the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
“This alarming spike in temperatures underscores the urgent need for robust adaptation strategies and proactive measures in India and the region to protect lives and livelihoods, especially among vulnerable populations, from the devastating health effects of such intense heat,” said Aamer, who researches climate vulnerabilities in South Asia.
For many in Delhi, the climate crisis has already made life during summer unbearable.
“We have to deal so we deal, we are poor people so we have to die, we have to work no matter how hot it is,” Kali Prasad said.
“We don’t have any other option.”"

Temperatures rose above 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, the highest reading of the summer and close to the country’s record high amid an ongoing heat wave, the met office said on Monday.
Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said.
In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters.
The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town’s and country’s record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively.
Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers.
But with the current heat wave, shops are seeing almost no footfall.
“The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,” Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town.
“I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.”
Close to Ali’s shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop’s shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business.
Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water.
“Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heat waves.
The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department
The heat wave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi — Pakistan’s largest city."

Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are solely the author’s. View more opinion articles on CNN.
Ecological apocalypse is a common theme of many Hollywood films, which specialize in visions of future devastation — the decapitated Statue of Liberty in “Planet of the Apes” (1968), the emptied planet’s surface in “12 Monkeys” (1995) and even the invasion of flying killer fish in the “Sharknado” franchise. Yet despite the imaginative fascination of movie-makers and movie audiences, the public sense of urgency about global warming remains limited, and government action over the decades has been sporadic at best. If we’re all worried about ecological destruction, why aren’t we moving more quickly towards ecological solutions?
There’s no one answer to this complicated question. However, George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015) and its new prequel, “Furiosa,” provide some possible explanations. (The distributor for “Furiosa” and CNN share a parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
These films connect ecological devastation to patriarchy and hierarchy; the collapse of global ecosystems and the scarcity of resources are inseparable from violent (and gendered) exploitation. Dealing with climate catastrophe requires a fundamental challenge to the systems that have created the climate catastrophe in the first place: something that Hollywood, and people outside Hollywood, have trouble imagining or embracing.
Like all the Mad Max films going back to the 1979 original, “Fury Road” and “Furiosa” are set in post-apocalyptic wastelands following some indeterminate eco-catastrophe. Food is scarce, water scarcer and civilization has disintegrated into warring gangs.
“Fury Road” and “Furiosa” focus on a citadel ruled by tyrannical, bloodthirsty and toothy-masked Immortan Joe (played in “Fury Road” by Hugh Keays-Byrne and in “Furiosa” by Lachy Hulme). Joe controls a water supply pumped from an underground aquifer; women serve as his wives and bear him children, or else are hitched to giant milking machines. Male children become war boys — fanatic fighters convinced that they’ll go to heaven if they die in battle for Joe.
Joe keeps most of the population subjugated: They’re thin, dirty and wait desperately for a sip of life-giving water. The control of natural resources gives Joe control of women’s reproduction and of male violence — or vice versa.
Either way, or both ways, Joe’s rule depends on mechanics of exploitation and hierarchy. Patriarchal power is built on treating both people and the environment as things — to be expropriated for the greater glory of Joe. A better world requires not just a better use of resources, but a different relationship to resources and each other.
In both Furiosa films, such a society emerges in the Green Place, the home from which Furiosa (played in “Fury Road” by Charlize Theron and in “Furiosa” by Anya Taylor-Joy) was stolen as a child. We only get glimpses of the Green Place, but it appears to be ruled collaboratively by women, and resources are shared, conserved and allocated to all.
Again, many Hollywood films address climate crisis. Yet calls for sweeping political change often sit uneasily within genre conventions and corporate moviemaking. There are some exceptions — such as the acerbic “Don’t Look Up” (2022). But in general, creators have largely tried to avoid the insight that “Furiosa” makes plain — to solve the climate crisis, we need to resolve a crisis of political exploitation and inequity.
One common narrative choice is to make the most fervent environmentalists the bad guys. Supervillains such as Thanos of “Infinity War” (2018) and Orm of “Aquaman” (2018) understand that the political status quo has to change in order to protect the earth’s resources and oceans. But their preferred response is genocide and/or dictatorship. We’re asked to view the superheroes (be they Avengers or Aquaman) the way the war boys view Immortan Joe; they’re the embodiment of good and of the law, and to overthrow them is to sow chaos and evil. In both films, heroes focus on defeating the threat to the status quo, and the climate dangers raised by the villains get largely shunted aside and forgotten in the roar of the plot and the blare of CGI.
Another typical Hollywood approach is to suggest that we can trust the powerful to enact change with enough time and faith. That’s the message in “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004), an early global warming apocalypse story, where a Dick Cheney-esque figure at first pooh-poohs the dangers of global apocalypse. But as things get worse, the Cheney analog understands the error of his ways, and becomes the kinder, more environmentally conscious Immortan Joe we need.
In line with “The Day After Tomorrow,” a lot of disaster movies focus on standard heroes committed to conventional verities like courage and family, as they battle the apocalypse and defeat it through predictable heroics. In such narratives, there’s limited or nonexistent discussion of the possibility for necessary political or social change. In “A Quiet Place” (2018) or “Underwater” (2020) or “Moonfall” (2022), climate or environmental apocalypse merges with monster movie. The goal in such films is generally to defeat outside invaders rather than to rethink how society works.
“Furiosa” too, arguably, shies away from some of the insights about power, climate and apocalypse that define “Fury Road.” Immortan Joe is not really the villain of the piece; that role goes to another warlord, Dementus (Chris Hemsworth).
It’s Dementus who kidnaps Furiosa as a child, and its Dementus who is the focus of her wrath and her revenge narrative. With Joe and Dementus at odds, Furiosa ends up on Joe’s side. Joe’s stable, responsible repression is at least more predictable than Dementus’ erratic, pointless brutality. If you’re going to be ruled by a violent patriarch, better to pick the one that delivers water on schedule, even if the rest of the world goes to hell.

In the latest film, Furiosa is plunged into such horror and trauma that she can’t focus on anything but her own survival and rage. Under constant assault, it’s difficult to imagine a better world. The worse world, in fact, can seem like the only available security. “Fury Road” and “Furiosa” can be seen together as Furiosa struggles to stop perceiving the Green Place as an ideal past, and to start thinking about how to change the current world so it becomes sustainable and just.
That’s a difficult fight, though. When the status quo feels like one rolling disaster, it’s easy to imagine various disasters getting worse. It’s harder to imagine how to change the world to make things better — especially when many people with money to do things like fund movies don’t want things to change too much. Immortan Joe likes the world the way it is, climate crisis and all. “Furiosa” both points towards a different road and shows us how hard that road is not just to travel, but to see."

As vast parts of Florida sweltered in oppressive heat over the weekend, South Florida TV meteorologist Steve MacLaughlin criticized the state’s new legislation that deleted most references to climate change from state law, and urged his viewers to vote.
“The entire world is looking to Florida to lead in climate change,” NBC 6’s MacLaughlin said during a May 18 segment. “Our government is saying that climate change is no longer the priority it once was.”
MacLaughlin’s comments come as South Florida swelters in exceptional heat for the month of May. The extreme temperatures prompted the National Weather Service to issue the first May heat advisory in 15 years on Friday. The month so far has been the warmest May on record for much of South Florida.
Just days earlier, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a controversial bill that deleted many references of climate change from state laws – a measure that MacLaughlin called in his X post, “Don’t Say Climate Change.” It made several changes to the state’s energy policy, in some cases deleting entire sections that discussed the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. It also gave preferential treatment to fossil fuel and banned offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida’s coast.
Florida’s coastal ecosystems have been ravaged by severe coral bleaching and its homes and businesses face inundation from sea level rise. The bill deleted the term “climate” eight times — often in reference to reducing fossil fuel emissions through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy “climate friendly” products when those products were cost-effective and available.
“Please keep in mind, the most powerful climate change solution is the one you already have in the palm of your hands — the right to vote,” MacLaughlin said. “And we will never tell you who to vote for but we will tell you this: We implore you to please do your research and know that there are candidates that believe in climate change and that there are solutions, and there are candidates that don’t.”
Aside from crazy-2023, the heat index has ALREADY spent more time above the 108°F threshold (and tied for the most at 110°+) in #Miami than in *any other entire year*. And it's not even June yet. 🤯🥵[1/2] pic.twitter.com/GewtmPXXo0
Other TV meteorologists praised MacLaughlin for delivering such strong remarks, especially during a time where climate communicators, journalists, meteorologists and national weather services have reported an increase in harassment, threats and abuse for connecting extreme weather events to climate change.
“This is not an easy statement for a meteorologist to make, as there is a lot of pressure to not wade into these climate waters,” Jeff Berardelli, the chief meteorologist at WFLA in Tampa Bay, said in response to the video clip MacLaughlin had posted on X, which has been viewed more than 350,000 times. “Big kudos to Steve for being bold and honest.”
Last year, a chief TV meteorologist at an Iowa news station resigned after receiving a series of harassing emails from some viewers.
“This is a time like no other to be courageous,” John Morales, a certified consulting meteorologist at ClimaData and the former chief meteorologist at NBC Miami, said on X, urging more meteorologists to follow suit."
Ocean water is rushing miles underneath the ‘Doomsday Glacier’ with potentially dire impacts on sea level rise,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/climate/doomsday-glacier-melt-antarctica-climate-intl/index.html,"Ocean water is rushing miles underneath the ‘Doomsday Glacier’ with potentially dire impacts on sea level rise
Follow:
Ocean water is pushing miles beneath Antarctica’s “Doomsday Glacier,” making it more vulnerable to melting than previously thought, according to new research which used radar data from space to perform an X-ray of the crucial glacier.
As the salty, relatively warm ocean water meets the ice, it’s causing “vigorous melting” underneath the glacier and could mean global sea level rise projections are being underestimated, according to the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica — nicknamed the “Doomsday Glacier” because its collapse could cause catastrophic sea level rise — is the world’s widest glacier and roughly the size of Florida. It’s also Antarctica’s most vulnerable and unstable glacier, in large part because the land on which it sits slopes downward, allowing ocean waters to eat away at its ice.
Thwaites, which already contributes 4% to global sea level rise, holds enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts as a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, scientists have estimated its complete collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise — a catastrophe for the world’s coastal communities.
Many studies have pointed to the immense vulnerabilities of Thwaites. Global warming, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, has left it hanging on “by its fingernails,” according to a 2022 study.
This latest research adds a new and alarming factor into projections of its fate.
A team of glaciologists — led by scientists from the University of California, Irvine — used high resolution satellite radar data, collected between March and June last year, to create an X-ray of the glacier. This allowed them to build a picture of changes to Thwaites’ “grounding line,” the point at which the glacier rises from the seabed and becomes a floating ice shelf. Grounding lines are vital to the stability of ice sheets, and a key point of vulnerability for Thwaites, but have been difficult to study.
“In the past, we had only sporadic data to look at this,” said Eric Rignot, professor of Earth system science at the University of California at Irvine and a co-author on the study. “In this new data set, which is daily and over several months, we have solid observations of what is going on.”
They observed seawater pushing beneath the glacier over many miles, and then moving out again, following the daily rhythm of the tides. When the water flows in, it’s enough to “jack up” the surface of the glacier by centimeters, Rignot told CNN.
He suggested the term “grounding zone” may be more apt than grounding line, as it can move nearly 4 miles over a 12-hour tidal cycle, according to their research.
The speed of the seawater, which moves considerable distances over a short time period, increases glacier melt because as soon as the ice melts, freshwater is washed out and replaced with warmer seawater, Rignot said.
“This process of widespread, enormous seawater intrusion will increase the projections of sea level rise from Antarctica,” he added.
Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study, called the research “fascinating and important.”
“This finding gives a process that, as yet, is not factored into models,” he told CNN. And while these results only apply to certain areas of the glacier, he said, “this could speed up the pace of ice loss in our forecasts.”
One uncertainty to be unraveled is whether the rush of seawater beneath Thwaites is a new phenomenon or whether it’s been significant but unknown for a long time, said James Smith, a marine geologist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the study.
“Either way, it’s clearly an important process that needs to be incorporated into ice sheet models,” he told CNN.
Noel Gourmelen, a professor of Earth observation at the University of Edinburgh, said use of radar data for this study was interesting. “Ironically it’s by going to space, using our growing satellite capabilities, that we’re learning much more about this environment,” he told CNN.
There are still many unknowns on what the study’s findings mean for the future of Thwaites, said Gourmelen who was not involved in the research. It is also unclear how widespread this process is around Antarctica, he told CNN, “although it is highly likely that this is happening elsewhere as well.”
A regime change
Antarctica, an isolated and complex continent, appears to be increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis.
In a separate study, also published Monday, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey looked at the reasons for the record low levels of sea ice surrounding Antarctica last year.
Analyzing satellite data and using climate models, they found this record low would have been “extremely unlikely to happen without the influence of climate change.”
Sea ice melting doesn’t directly affect sea level rise because it’s already floating, but it leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them much more vulnerable to melting and breaking up.
The researchers also used climate models to predict the potential speed of recovery from such extreme sea ice loss and found that even after two decades, not all the ice will return.
“The impacts of Antarctic sea ice staying low for over twenty years would be profound, including on local and global weather,” Louise Sime, a co-author on the BAS study, said in a statement.
The findings add to evidence over the last few years that the region is facing a “lasting regime shift,” the authors wrote."
"As sea levels rise, DeSantis signs bill deleting climate change mentions from Florida state law",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/desantis-bill-climate-change-florida/index.html,"As sea levels rise, DeSantis signs bill deleting climate change mentions from Florida state law
Follow:
As Florida copes with rising seas and record temperatures, lawmakers are going to exceptional lengths to delete many mentions of climate change from state laws in a new bill that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Wednesday, according to his official X account.
The wide-ranging law makes several changes to the state’s energy policy – in some cases deleting entire sections of state law that talk about the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. The bill would also give preferential treatment to natural gas and ban offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida’s coast.
The bill deletes the phrase ‘climate’ eight times – often in reference to reducing the impacts of global climate change through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy ‘climate friendly’ products when they are cost-effective and available. The bill also gets rid of a requirement that state-purchased vehicles should be fuel efficient.
“Florida rejects the designs of the left to weaken our energy grid, pursue a radical climate agenda, and promote foreign adversaries,” DeSantis said in a post on X, posting a graphic that said the law would protect the state from “green zealots.”
“What Florida is really doing is saying we’re going to deemphasize any policies that would help mitigate climate change,” said Emily Hammond, a professor of law at George Washington University.
It’s certainly not the first time Republican politicians have deleted the phrase ‘climate change’ – erasing the phrase from government websites was a commonplace activity during the Trump administration. But experts said few other states have passed bills to move away from clean energy and erase climate mentions from their laws.
“It goes further than any other state has gone in repealing its existing climate laws,” Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told CNN.
Last year was the hottest year on record for Florida, breaking yet another heat record in the state. South Florida in particular observed scorching heat index temperatures that reached as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Sea levels have risen as much as eight inches higher than they were in 1950, already leading to increased flooding from storms and tides alike.
“Florida is one of the most vulnerable states in the country,” Gerrard said. “All of South Florida is at great peril from sea level rise. They should be the last state to stand in the way of fighting climate change.”
Even as Florida politicians are erasing mentions of climate change from their laws, they are also increasingly focused on helping a storm and flood-prone state withstand climate impacts.
DeSantis and state lawmakers have poured over $1.1 billion into increasing community resilience to flooding and storms, according to a 2023 news release from the governor’s office. In 2019, DeSantis appointed the state’s first chief resilience officer Julia Nesheiwat – who explicitly referenced climate change and sea level rise as a “significant challenge” to the state. (Nesheiwat has since left her post and replaced by the state’s current chief resilience officer Wesley Brooks).
Florida has also accepted millions of dollars in federal funding to help reconstruct a state highway in Miami Beach – elevating the pavement and installing new pump stations to help clear the road of water during flooding events.
When it comes to other federal climate and clean energy funding, however, the state hasn’t been eager to accept. DeSantis vetoed over $29 million dollars in federal energy rebates and energy efficiency grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Florida was one of five states that declined to compete for $4.6 billion in federal climate grants, although numerous Florida metropolitan areas including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa have raised their hands for the funding instead.
Hammond and Gerrard said this approach from Florida politicians to fund programs dealing with climate impacts without acknowledging its root cause isn’t surprising. Hammond called focusing on adapting to climate change and hardening infrastructure without attribute it to a warming planet “consistent to the conservative approach.”
“They don’t want to acknowledge that climate change is happening; they acknowledge they have flooding,” Gerrard said. “If it’s about moving away from fossil fuels, they don’t like it.”"

Last summer, marked by deadly extreme heat and devastating wildfires, was the warmest in at least 2,000 years, according to new research, which analyzed weather data and tree rings to reconstruct a detailed picture of the past.
The findings offer a stark insight into the “unparalleled” warming the world is experiencing today thanks to humans burning vast amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels, according to the authors of the study published Tuesday in the Journal Nature. And it’s an alarming signal as some scientists warn 2024 is on track to be even hotter still.
Global warming is currently tracked by comparing temperatures to the “pre-industrial era,” before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, widely defined as the period between 1850 to 1900.  Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries agreed to restrict global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
Last summer, the world temporarily breached this threshold, according to the report.  Using data taken from temperature instruments during this period, the scientists found the Northern Hemisphere summer in 2023 was 2.07 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial period.
But observational data from this period is sparse, uncertain and skews warmer. So, for a fuller picture of how the climate varied naturally before the start of the pre-industrial era, the study authors looked much further into the past.
To do this, they used detailed sets of tree ring records from thousands of trees across nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, but excluding the Tropics which lack good tree data.
Trees act as time capsules. The patterns of their rings – affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature – provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back centuries or even thousands of years.
This complex tree ring data allowed the scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them to last summer’s temperatures.
They found the summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this period.
It was at least 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the warmest summer during this period, the year 246 – when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Mayan Civilization dominated Central America.
At the other end of the scale, last summer was nearly 4 degrees Celsius warmer than the coldest summer the study identified, the year 536 – when a volcanic eruption pumped out vast amounts of planet-cooling gases.
Using this 2,000-year data set, they calculated that the summer of 2023 was 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter than the long-term pre-industrial average, before robust networks of instruments could measure the weather.
The study follows a report published in November, which found humanity lived through the hottest 12-month period in at least 125,000 years. The study, and others like it, rely on data extracted from other proxies, such as ice cores and coral reefs, which don’t give the same detailed yearly evidence as tree rings.
This makes it hard to compare individual days or even years with those in the past, said Jan Esper, lead author of the study and professor of climate geography at Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany.
It is possible – even likely – last year was the hottest in at least 125,000 years, he added, but “we don’t have the data” to say for certain.
The deep dive into the year-by-year temperatures of Northern Hemisphere summers is a “worthwhile endeavor,” said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved in the study.
What’s impressive, she told CNN, is “we have enough temperature reconstructions from enough places around the world to document the exceptional nature of a single year of large-scale temperature extremes.”
This “treasure chest of data” can be used to “sharpen our projections of future climate extremes,” she added.
While the study can place the extraordinary Northern Hemisphere heat into historical context, it cannot be applied on a global scale, Esper said. There simply isn’t enough tree ring data from the Southern Hemisphere and the Tropics, he said.
The study’s findings are deeply worrying, Esper said. “There are potential irreversible processes in the system, and I am afraid not of myself. I’m old,” he added. “I’m concerned for the kids.”

Follow:
A deadly heat wave in Gaza in April, which saw punishing temperatures worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis, was made hotter and more likely by the human-caused climate crisis, according to an analysis published Tuesday.
Gaza was not alone. Several heat waves spanning a vast area of the Asian continent last month during the world’s hottest April on record were made more intense and likely by the climate crisis, the analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA) found.
The WWA report divided the heat waves into three areas: West Asia, the Philippines and a region spanning South and Southeast Asia.
In West Asia, the analysis focused on the Palestinian territories, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, where temperatures spiked above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) last month. It found climate change made the heat in this region around five times more likely and 1.7 degrees Celsius hotter than it would have been before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels.
Soaring temperatures had a particularly stark impact on the 1.7 million displaced people in Gaza, already struggling with insufficient water access and inadequate healthcare. There was little respite from the relentless heat for those crammed into makeshift tents and shelters, often covered with plastic sheets. At least three people, including two children, reportedly died from the heat, the analysis notes.
In the Philippines, the extreme heat last month — which forced hundreds of schools to close as temperatures reached more than 42 degrees Celsius — had such a strong link to human-caused global warming the report concluded it would have been impossible without it.
To calculate the influence of climate change on the extreme heat, WWA researchers used weather data and computer models to compare the world’s current climate — which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels — with the climate of the past.
“From Gaza to Delhi to Manila, people suffered and died when April temperatures soared in Asia,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment and a report author, said in a statement. “Heat waves have always happened. But the additional heat, driven by emissions from oil, gas and coal, is resulting in death for many people.”
The scientists also examined the role of El Niño, a natural climate pattern that influences global weather.
While they found it had no influence in West Asia’s April heat, it did affect the intensity of heat in the Philippines, pushing up temperatures by 0.2 degrees Celsius. However, the impact of climate change there was greater, increasing temperatures by about 1.2 degrees.
In today’s warmer world, the kind of extreme heat waves experienced in Gaza and West Asia, as well as the Philippines, are not rare and can be expected around once every 10 years, the report found. But it warns worse could be in store.
If the planet’s average temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is predicted to happen in the 2040s or 2050s if the world does not decarbonize fast enough, similar extreme heat waves could be expected once every five years in West Asia and every two to three years in the Philippines.
Heat wave made 45 times more likely
The WWA analysis also looked at parts of South and Southeast Asia, many of which also experienced unprecedented heat last month.
Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam all broke records for their hottest April day, while temperatures spiked to 46 degrees Celsius (115 Fahrenheit) ﻿in India. Bangladesh and Thailand also experienced scorching April temperatures and were included in the study.
Climate change also played a pronounced role in this region, according to the analysis, making the heat 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter.
The scientists took a simpler approach than usual for this part of Asia, looking only at weather data and not computer models, because the region overlapped with two previous analyses of extreme heat events in 2022 and 2023, which also found climate change played a strong role.
The numbers in the report are important, Otto said, “because they show us that everywhere climate change is an absolute game changer when it comes to extreme heat.” But numbers alone don’t necessarily show how bad the impacts are — these depend on people’s vulnerability and exposure.
Days of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) were “particularly difficult for people working outdoors, people living in informal housing (and) people living in refugee camps,” Otto said.
Asia is also home to some of the planet’s fastest growing cities, said Carolina Pereira Marghidan, climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, on a call with reporters. This has led to rapid, unplanned development. “Many cities have seen extreme losses of green space,” Pereira said, increasing the impacts of extreme heat on residents.
The world must take “massive, unprecedented steps to reduce emissions,” said Mariam Zachariah, a researcher at the Grantham Institute, in a statement. If not, she added, “extreme heat will lead to even greater suffering in Asia.”"
The ‘world’s largest’ vacuum to suck climate pollution out of the air just opened.

Here’s how it works
Follow:
The “world’s largest” plant designed to suck planet-heating pollution out of the atmosphere like a giant vacuum began operating in Iceland on Wednesday.
“Mammoth” is the second commercial direct air capture plant opened by Swiss company Climeworks in the country, and is 10 times bigger than its predecessor, Orca, which started running in 2021.
Direct air capture, or DAC, is a technology designed to suck in air and strip out the carbon using chemicals. The carbon can then be injected deep beneath the ground, reused or transformed into solid products.
Climeworks plans to transport the carbon underground where it will be naturally transformed into stone, locking up the carbon permanently. It is partnering with Icelandic company Carbfix for this so-called sequestration process.
The whole operation will be powered by Iceland’s abundant, clean geothermal energy.
Next-gen climate solutions like DAC are gaining more attention from governments and private industry as humans continue to burn fossil fuels. Concentrations of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2023.
As the planet continues to heat up — with devastating consequences for humans and nature — many scientists say the world needs to find ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere in addition to rapidly cutting fossil fuels.
But carbon removal technologies such as DAC are still controversial. They have been criticized as expensive, energy-hungry and unproven at scale. Some climate advocates are also concerned they could distract from policies to cut fossil fuels.
This technology “is fraught with uncertainties and ecological risks,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, speaking about carbon capture generally.
Climeworks started building Mammoth in June 2022, and the company says it is the world’s largest such plant. It has a modular design with space for 72 “collector containers” — the vacuum parts of the machine that capture carbon from the air — which can be stacked on top of each other and moved around easily. There are currently 12 of these in place with more due to be added over the next few months.
Mammoth will be able to pull 36,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year at full capacity, according to Climeworks. That’s equivalent to taking around 7,800 gas-powered cars off the road for a year.
Climeworks did not give an exact cost for each ton of carbon removed, but said it was closer to $1,000 a ton than $100 a ton – the latter of which is widely seen as a key threshold for making the technology affordable and viable.
As the company scales up the size of its plants and bring costs down, the aim is to reach $300 to $350 a ton by 2030 before hitting $100 a ton around 2050, said Jan Wurzbacher, co-founder and co-CEO of Climeworks, on a call with reporters.
The new plant is “an important step in the fight against climate change,” said Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh. It will increase the size of equipment to capture carbon pollution.
But, he cautioned, it’s still a tiny fraction of what’s needed.
All the carbon removal equipment in the world is only capable of removing around 0.01 million metric tons of carbon a year, a far cry from the 70 million tons a year needed by 2030 to meet global climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency.
There are already much bigger DAC plants in the works from other companies. Stratos, currently under construction in Texas, for example, is designed to remove 500,000 tons of carbon a year, according to Occidental, the oil company behind the plant.
But there may be a catch. Occidental says the captured carbon will be stored in rock deep underground, but its website also refers to the company’s use of captured carbon in a process called “enhanced oil recovery.” This involves pushing carbon into wells to force out the hard-to-reach remnants of oil — allowing fossil fuel companies to extract even more from aging oil fields.
It’s this kind of process that makes some critics concerned carbon removal technologies could be used to prolong production of fossil fuels.
But for Climeworks, which is not connected to fossil fuel companies, the technology has huge potential, and the company says it has big ambitions.
Jan Wurzbacher, the company’s co-founder and co-CEO, said Mammoth is just the latest stage in Climeworks’ plan to scale up to 1 million tons of carbon removal a year by 2030 and 1 billion tons by 2050.
Plans include potential DAC plants in Kenya and the United States.

The climate crisis is underway. Here are 5 things you can do to help,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/climate-crisis-how-to-help-wellness/index.html,"The climate crisis is underway. Here are 5 things you can do to help

It is crystal clear to many people that we are living in a time of climate crisis caused in large part by the burning of fossil fuels , which lead to the emission of greenhouse gasses that trap the sun’s heat, raising temperatures and leading to a cascade of unintended and unwanted consequences.
The climate crisis impacts Earth — its land, its atmosphere and its bodies of water — and it also profoundly affects the health and behavior of the planet’s inhabitants large and small, including humanity. And CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir has a front-row seat to the ever-evolving situation.
When Weir became a new “old” dad at the start of the pandemic — his son, River, was born in April 2020 (his daughter Olivia was 16 at the time) — he had a revelation.
“I looked down at this little squiggling bundle of joy in my arms and realized this kid is going to live to see the 22nd century,” Weir told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on a special episode of the Chasing Life podcast. “And I started writing, sort of, a letter of apology to him for the planet we broke that he was moving into.”
That letter eventually became the introduction of Weir’s new book, “Life As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate, and Hope in a Changing World,” which came out earlier in April, in time for Earth Day.
Weir said that everything in our lives depends on a planet in balance — and currently, it’s not.
“Five million people die prematurely every year just to, just from particulate pollution of burning fossil fuels around the world,” Weir said. “The heat already kills more people, I think, than all the other disasters combined.”
Throughout all of this turmoil, people are all still trying to fulfill their needs, Weir said, pointing to Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.
“Layer one is just the stuff that keeps you alive: air, water, temperature around 68 degrees Fahrenheit, (the) right amount of minerals, sleep. If you don’t get those, nothing else matters,” he said.
Weir said something clicked for him when he thought about the world his son was inheriting. “What if you can no longer take for granted the bottom of our pyramids, like I did? I never thought about where my water came from or the quality of my air,” he said.
“The Earth I joined in 1967 is gone now, and no one knows what kind of planet will replace it,” Weir wrote to River.
The planet’s degradation has created climate grief — the mourning of a place we still live in, precisely because it is changing so dramatically under our very feet.
Weir draws a parallel between these sentiments and another well-known model: the five stages of grief created by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
“You can take a road trip through America and drive through big swaths of denial,” Weir said. To essentially bargain with rising seas, he said, the city of Charleston, South Carolina, is erecting a seawall and Miami is raising streets. “There’s a lot of anger, a lot of depression. But ultimately, until you get to acceptance, that’s what turns people from survivors into thrivers or leads to a more peaceful end.”
Weir said he hopes humanity can get to the acceptance phase quickly, and band together to address the issues facing us. He is optimistic — perhaps surprisingly, given the dire warnings we continue not to heed.
What can you do to help the story end well for humanity? Weir has these five tips.

Globally, we have got to get our fossil fuel consumption under control. The United States is among the top three greenhouse gas-emitting countries. When we burn fossil fuel for electricity, heat and transportation, the process generates these heat-trapping emissions  .
Weir recalls speaking to a fisherman in Maine, who called our addiction to carbon-based fossil fuels a “Godzilla.”
“Chopping up ‘Carbon Godzilla’ and putting him back where it came from is humanity’s No. 1 job going forward.”
“There are technological ways to do this, various nature-based ways to do it,” said Weir, noting that until that happens at scale, “it’s going to be hard to save this patient.”
Take a page from the camel playbook. Camels are originally from Canada but adapted to the heat when they found themselves in the desert, Weir explained.
“Twenty-five thousand years ago, the camels were dodging bears and jumping over beaver dams. And that big hump of fat was evolved to give them energy over the winter, and their eyelids were evolved to keep out snowstorms, not sandstorms,” Weir said. “After a couple of camels got lost and wandered across the Bering land bridge into Asia, (they) discovered that all these tools work great in sand and on long hot desert treks.”
Humans don’t have time on our side, said Weir, referring to the thousands of years it took camels to evolve, “but we have the technology.” As an example, he cited the whitest paint ever created, which reflects 98% of light back into space and can cool a building by up to 19 degrees Fahrenheit  (10.6 degrees Celsius ).
Identify the people making positive changes and support them.
Weir said the best tip he ever got for covering a disaster was from Mr. Rogers, who said his own mother told him to “look for the helpers” when he saw a scary event on TV.
“There’s always helpers rushing into disasters,” Weir said. When he’s really down, “I need to look for the helpers — not just people who are managing communities in the aftermath of something like the wildfire in Lahaina, or after a hurricane, but also the folks who are looking for better ideas and ways to fix the problem and to create healthier, more sustainable, resilient pieces of our lives.”
Become an active member of your community; treat the environment and one another with the same respect and care that many  indigenous communities do.
“It is taking care of water and soil and air… (that) fills those (Maslow) needs in ways that we can’t imagine in our modern, convenient world,” he said. “We live in the golden age of self-isolation, whereas we need each other more than ever,” he said.
To do that, help in the way best suited to you, whether it’s organizing a rally, putting your expertise to work for a good cause or helping to clean up a neighborhood park.
“I just want folks to connect with each other and nature in the best possible ways,” he said.
When you have the opportunity, give the environment a break. Think about filling your basic Maslow-pyramid needs in a way that is more sustainable.
In his book, Weir reminds us that Maslow wrote, “Man is a perpetually wanting animal.” But, Weir wrote, “he (Maslow) leaves off ‘on a planet with finite resources.’”
“(It) doesn’t matter how you draw the Pyramid of Needs; what matters is how you fill it,” Weir wrote.
So consider how ﻿you fill it. Maybe reduce your dependence on single-use plastics; walk to the market instead of driving; take into consideration the carbon footprint of your diet; take care not to waste food, water, materials, clothing. Small things add up.

A 300-year-old settlement resurfaces as severe drought dries up a dam in the Philippines,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/30/climate/settlement-resurfaces-philippines-climate-dam-scli-intl/index.html,"A 300-year-old settlement resurfaces as severe drought dries up a dam in the Philippines
Follow:
A nearly 300-year-old settlement once submerged beneath a major dam in the Philippines has reemerged as sweltering heat and drought dry up the reservoir.
Structures, including part of a church, tombstones and a municipal hall marker, reappeared in the middle of Pantabangan Dam in Nueva Ecija province in March after months of almost no rain, Marlon Paladin, a supervising engineer for the National Irrigation Administration, told AFP.
The area was deliberately flooded in the 1970s in the dam’s construction. But a drought currently affecting about half of the country’s provinces has pushed the dam’s water levels down, according to AFP.
Figures from the Philippine government’s weather agency, PAGASA, show those levels on April 30 were nearly 50 meters (160 feet) lower than normal.
Paladin told AFP that this is the sixth time the settlement has resurfaced since the creation of the reservoir, but “this is the longest time [it was visible] based on my experience.”
When water levels drop, the ruins become a popular tourist attraction, according to AFP.
Like much of Southeast Asia, the Philippines has for the past several weeks been hit by scorching heat, leading schools to suspend classes after temperatures hit 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit).
Although April and May are normally the hottest months in the Philippines, with temperatures averaging in the mid-30s  (high 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), much of the country has seen even hotter temperatures.
In the past five days, the heat index in some areas has exceeded 40 degrees (104 degrees Fahrenheit), figures from PAGASA show. Heat index is a calculation of what the human body feels the temperature is like. It takes into account the actual temperature and humidity, which affects the body’s ability to cool itself.
The town of Muñoz near the dam has seen heat index over 41 degrees (106 degrees Fahrenheit) the last five days. On Sunday the temperature felt like 47 degrees (117 degrees Fahrenheit) because of other contributing factors. As of the end of March, drought covered much of northern and central Luzon, including Nueva Ecija province where the dam is located, according to PAGASA.
April has remained dry across the country, with portions of central and southern Luzon seeing less than 25% of the rainfall they should receive at this time, according to the US Climate Prediction Center.
This year, the El Niño climate pattern has exacerbated those conditions, according to AFP. This natural fluctuation comes on top of planetary warming caused by human-driven climate change.
In recent years, temperatures in the region — one of the most vulnerable in the world to the effects of climate change — have climbed to unprecedented heights, leaving hundreds of millions suffering in unforgiving heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN.
Last spring, several countries in Southeast Asia experienced record-breaking heat well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
A 2023 report from the World Weather Attribution described that heatwave as a once-in-200-years event that would have been “virtually impossible to have occurred without climate change.”

An El Niño-less summer is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/weather/la-nina-summer-forecast-us-el-nino-climate/index.html,"An El Niño-less summer is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US
Follow:
It may be spring, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to summer weather, especially when El Niño – a player in last year’s especially brutal summer – is rapidly weakening and will all but vanish by the time the season kicks into gear.
El Niño’s disappearing act doesn’t mean relief from the heat. Not when the world is heating up due to human-driven climate change. In fact, forecasters think it could mean the opposite.
What this summer’s weather could look like
El Niño is a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. When the water gets cooler than average, it’s a La Niña. Either phase can have an effect on weather around the globe.
By June, forecasters expect those ocean temperatures to hover close to normal, marking a so-called neutral phase, before La Niña builds in early summer, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
But the strength of El Niño or La Niña’s influence on US weather isn’t uniform and varies greatly based on the strength of the phenomena and the season itself.
The influence of El Niño or La Niña on US weather isn’t as clear-cut in the summer as it is in the winter, especially during a transition between the two phases, said Michelle L’Heureux, a climate scientist with the Climate Prediction Center.
Temperature differences between the tropics and North America are more extreme in the winter, L’Heureux explained. This allows the jet stream to become quite strong and influential, reliably sending storms into certain parts of the US.
In the summer, the difference in temperature between the two regions isn’t as significant and the obvious influence on US weather wanes.
But we can look back at what happened during similar summers to get a glimpse of what could come this summer.
In short: It’s not cool.
The summer of 2016 was one of the hottest on record for the Lower 48. La Niña conditions were in place by midsummer and followed a very strong El Niño winter.
Summer 2020 followed a similar script: La Niña conditions formed midsummer after a weak El Niño winter but still produced one of the hottest summers on record and the most active hurricane season on record.
Then there’s the fact that these climate phenomena are playing out in a warming world, raising the ceiling on the extreme heat potential.
“This obviously isn’t our grandmother’s transition out of El Niño – we’re in a much warmer world so the impacts will be different,” L’Heureux, said. “We’re seeing the consequences of climate change.”
Current summer temperature outlooks for the US are certainly bringing the heat.
Above-average temperatures are forecast over nearly every square mile of the Lower 48. Only portions of the Dakotas, Minnesota and Montana have an equal chance of encountering near normal, above- or below-normal temperatures.
A huge portion of the West is likely to have warmer conditions than normal. This forecast tracks with decades of climate trends, according to L’Heureux.
Summers have warmed more in the West than in any other region of the US since the early 1990s, according to data from NOAA. Phoenix is a prime example. The city’s average July temperature last year was an unheard-of 102.7 degrees, making it the hottest month on record for any US city. It was also the deadliest year on record for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.
Forecasts also show a worrying precipitation trend for parts of the West.
Large sections of the West and the central US are likely to be drier than normal. This dryness, combined with above-normal heat, which only amplifies the dryness, could be a recipe for new or worsening drought.
Wetter than normal conditions are in the forecast from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Stormy weather could be a consistent companion for much of the East – but whether it comes from typical rain and thunderstorms or tropical activity won’t be known for months.
A brutal summer also predicted in the water
Heat isn’t the only threat to look out for.
The strengthening La Niña conditions, coupled with ocean temperatures which have been at record highs for over a year, could supercharge the Atlantic hurricane season.
A warming world generates more fuel for more tropical activity and stronger storms. La Niña tends to produce favorable atmospheric conditions to allow storms to form and hold together in the Atlantic.
Early this month, forecasters at Colorado State University released their most active initial forecast ever.
“We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,” the group said in a news release."

A coal billionaire is building the world’s biggest clean energy plant and it’s five times the size of Paris
Follow:
Five times the size of Paris. Visible from space. The world’s biggest energy plant. Enough electricity to power Switzerland.
The scale of the project transforming swathes of barren salt desert on the edge of western India into one of the most important sources of clean energy anywhere on the planet is so overwhelming that the man in charge can’t keep up.
“I don’t even do the math any more,” Sagar Adani told CNN in an interview last week.
Adani is executive director of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). He’s also the nephew of Gautam Adani, Asia’s second richest man, whose $100 billion fortune stems from the Adani Group, India’s biggest coal importer and a leading miner of the dirty fuel. Founded in 1988, the conglomerate has businesses in fields ranging from ports and thermal power plants to media and cements.
Its clean energy unit AGEL is building the sprawling solar and wind power plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat at a cost of about $20 billion. It will be the world’s biggest renewable park when it is finished in about five years, and should generate enough clean electricity to power 16 million Indian homes.
The success of the Khavda Renewable Energy Park is critical to India’s efforts to reduce pollution and hit its climate goals while meeting the burgeoning energy needs of the world’s most populous nation and fastest-growing major economy. Coal still accounts for 70% of the electricity India generates.
Situated just 12 miles from one of the world’s most dangerous borders separating India and Pakistan, the park will cover more than 200 square miles and be the planet’s largest power plant regardless of the energy source, AGEL said.
“A region so large, a region that is so unencumbered, there’s no wildlife, there’s no vegetation, there’s no habitation. There is no better alternative use of that land,” said Adani.
The group’s big green plans haven’t been dented by the turbulent year it has had since January 2023, when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades.
The Indian mining-to-media conglomerate denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Gautam Adani’s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion in the month following the release of the report.
But the tycoon has since bounced back and the group is now pouring billions into the clean energy sector.
It plans to invest $100 billion into energy transition over the next decade, with 70% of the investments ear-marked for clean energy.
A necessity for 1.4 billion people
Adani Group’s clean energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some ambitious climate goals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that renewable sources such as solar and wind power will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade.
In 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies.
The government has set a target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by 2030. AGEL, the country’s largest renewable energy company, aims to provide at least 9% of that, with nearly 30 GW generated from its Khavda park in Gujarat alone.
Failing to transition to renewable energy is not an option, said Adani.
“There is no choice for India but to start doing things at a previously unimagined size and scale,” the 30-year-old said.
That’s because energy demand is going to explode in the coming years.
India is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, data from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) shows.
That could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of it still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the rapidly-expanding economy will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said.
“If India does what China did, if India does what Europe did, if India does what the US did, then we are all in for a very, very bleak climatic future,” said Adani, referring to the historic use of fossil fuels as those countries developed.
His dire predictions are not dramatic. India is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become the world’s third largest economy before the end of this decade.
As it develops and modernizes, its urban population will shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. According to analysts, India is set to add the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years.
Electricity demand is expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved living standards to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years.
By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said.
India cannot rely on fossil fuels for its burgeoning needs without disastrous consequences for efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
“If you imagine 800 GW of coal-fired thermal capacity being added … this by itself will kill all other sustainable energy initiatives happening all across the world, in terms of carbon emissions,” said Adani.
Both sides of the street
The conglomerate’s green plans are impressive, but climate experts are critical of its continued massive investments in fossil fuels.
“[Gautam] Adani continues to walk both sides of the street,” said Tim Buckley, director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance.
The Adani Group is not only one of the largest developers and operators of coal mines in India, but also operates the controversial Carmichael Coal Mine in Australia, which has faced fierce opposition from climate change campaigners who say it is a “death sentence” for the Great Barrier Reef.
“Rather than ploughing billions into new fossil fuel projects, India would be far better served if Adani put 100% of its efforts and resources into developing low-cost zero emissions technologies,” Buckley added.
That is not an option at the moment, said Adani.
More than 600 million people in India will be “coming into middle income and upper income over the next decade, decade and a half,” he said. “They cannot be deprived of basic needs of energy. ”
Everyone would be happy if we could “have a 100% of that being provided from sustainable energy sources …[but]… practically, that’s not an option” at the moment, he added.
He also said that activists in developed nations, which have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, are often unable to understand the staggering challenge facing India to grow its economy and its clean energy industry at the same time.
“I think it’s also very important to respect the fact that every country has its own right to make sure that the people of their own country are well-served from an energy perspective,” Adani said.
“So is India doing a bit of coal? Yes, of course India is. But is India doing a massive amount of renewables? Yes, there’s no question,” he added

The world’s 100 worst polluted cities are in Asia — and 83 of them are in just one country,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/climate/air-pollution-report-2023-asia-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"The world’s 100 worst polluted cities are in Asia — and 83 of them are in just one country
Follow:
All but one of the 100 cities with the world’s worst air pollution last year were in Asia, according to a new report, with the climate crisis playing a pivotal role in bad air quality that is risking the health of billions of people worldwide.
The vast majority of these cities — 83 — were in India and all exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines by more than 10 times, according to the report by IQAir, which tracks air quality worldwide.
The study looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous. Only 9% of more than 7,800 cities analyzed globally recorded air quality that met WHO’s standard, which says average annual levels of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter.
“We see that in every part of our lives that air pollution has an impact,” said IQAir Global CEO Frank Hammes. “And it typically, in some of the most polluted countries, is likely shaving off anywhere between three to six years of people’s lives. And then before that will lead to many years of suffering that are entirely preventable if there’s better air quality.”
When inhaled, PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and other respiratory illnesses, as well as cognitive impairment in children.
Begusarai, a city of half a million people in northern India’s Bihar state, was the world’s most polluted city last year with an average annual PM2.5 concentration of 118.9 — 23 times the WHO guidelines. It was followed in the IQAir rankings by the Indian cities of Guwahati, Assam; Delhi; and Mullanpur, Punjab.
Across India, 1.3 billion people, or 96% of the population, live with air quality seven times higher than WHO guidelines, according to the report.
Central and South Asia were the worst performing regions globally, home to all four of the most polluted countries last year: Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Tajikistan.
South Asia is of particular concern, with 29 of the 30 most polluted cities in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. The report ranked the major population centers of Lahore in 5th, New Delhi in 6th and Dhaka in 24th place.
Hammes said no significant improvement in pollution levels in the region is likely without “major changes in terms of the energy infrastructure and agricultural practices.”
“What’s also worrisome in many parts of the world is that the things that are causing outdoor air pollution are also sometimes the things that are causing indoor air pollution,” he added. “So cooking with dirty fuel will create indoor exposures that could be many times what you’re seeing outdoors.”
A global problem
IQAir found that 92.5% of the 7,812 locations in 134 countries, regions, and territories where it analyzed average air quality last year exceeded WHO’s PM2.5 guidelines.
Only 10 countries and territories had “healthy” air quality: Finland, Estonia, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Bermuda, Grenada, Iceland, Mauritius and French Polynesia.
Millions of people die each year from air pollution-related health issues. Air pollution from fossil fuels is killing 5.1 million people worldwide every year, according to a study published in the BMJ in November. Meanwhile, WHO says 6.7 million people die annually from the combined effects of ambient and household air pollution.
The human-caused climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, plays a “pivotal” role in influencing air pollution levels, the IQAir report said.
The climate crisis is altering weather patterns, leading to changes in wind and rainfall, which affects the dispersion of pollutants. Climate change will only make pollution worse as extreme heat becomes more severe and frequent, it said.
The climate crisis is also leading to more severe wildfires in many regions and longer and more intense pollen seasons, both of which exacerbate health issues linked to air pollution.
“We have such a strong overlap of what’s causing our climate crisis and what’s causing air pollution,” Hammes said. “Anything that we can do to reduce air pollution will be tremendously impactful in the long term also for improving our climate gas emissions, and vice versa.”
Regional rankings
North America was badly affected by wildfires that raged in Canada from May to October last year. In May, the monthly average of air pollution in Alberta was nine times greater than the same month in 2022, the report found.
And for the first time, Canada surpassed the United States in the regional pollution rankings.
The wildfires also affected US cities such as Minneapolis and Detroit, where annual pollution averages rose by 30% to 50% compared to the previous year. The most polluted major US city in 2023 was Columbus, Ohio for the second year running. But major cities like Portland, Seattle and Los Angeles experienced significant drops in annual average pollution levels, the report said.
In Asia, however, pollution levels rebounded across much of the region.
China reversed a five-year trend of declining levels of pollution, the report found. Chinese cities used to dominate global rankings of the world’s worst air quality but a raft of clean air policies over the past decade has transformed things for the better.
A study last year had found the campaign meant the average Chinese citizen’s lifespan is now 2.2 years longer. But thick smog returned to Beijing last year, where citizens experienced a 14% increase in the annual average PM2.5 concentration, according to the IQAir report. China’s most polluted city, Hotan, was listed at 14 in the IQAir ranking.
In Southeast Asia, only the Philippines saw a drop in annual pollution levels compared to the previous year, the report found.
Indonesia was the most polluted country in the region, with a 20% increase compared to 2022. Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand all had cities that exceeded WHO PM2.5 guidelines by more than 10 times, according to the report.
Last month, Thai authorities ordered government employees to work from home due to unhealthy levels of pollution in the capital Bangkok and surrounding areas, according to Reuters. On Friday, tourism hot spot Chiang Mai was the world’s most polluted city as toxic smog brought by seasonal agricultural burning blanketed the northern city.
Inequality… and one bright spot
The report also highlighted a worrying inequality: the lack of monitoring stations in countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, which results in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.
Although Africa saw an improvement in the number of countries included in this year’s report compared with previous years the continent largely remains the most underrepresented. According to IQAir, only 24 of 54 African countries had sufficient data available from their monitoring stations.
Seven African countries were among the new locations included in the 2023 rankings, including Burkina Faso, the world’s fifth most polluted country, and Rwanda, in 15th.
Several countries that ranked high on the most polluted list last year were not included for 2023 due to a lack of available data. They include Chad, which was the most polluted country in 2022.
“There is so much hidden air pollution still on the planet,” said Hammes.
One bright spot is increasing pressure and civic engagement from communities, NGOs, companies, and scientists to monitor air quality.
“Ultimately that’s great because it really shows governments that people do care,” Hammes said."

On Thursday, Baripada in the eastern state of Odisha hit 43.6 C (110.4 F) and Telangana’s Khammam in the south reached 43.4 C (110.1 F), according to the IMD, which warned last month that India would likely see stronger and longer heat waves this year due to above-normal temperatures.
Gandhi Ray, a farmer in his 60s from eastern Bihar state, said he lives in a small hut in the forest, and will walk to a nearby village to vote.
Temperatures above 41 C (105 F) are forecast every day until May 1 in his hometown of Banka district, according to the IMD.
“It’s important for me to vote but definitely every day this heat is getting worse and worse,” he told CNN. “I work outdoors mostly so I am used to it but as I get older it becomes harder to cope. Now my kids have taken over most of the work.”
High temperatures have raised concern this election cycle, as campaigns marked by outdoor political rallies draw thousands of people under the baking sun. The issue was underscored Wednesday, when one lawmaker collapsed from the heat while addressing supporters in western Maharashtra state.
The Election Commission, National Disaster Management Authority and IMD formed a task force to minimize the impact of heat waves ahead of polling days and Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting earlier this month to review the country’s preparedness for the hot season.
The Election Commission has released guidelines for staying cool at polling stations, including drinking water and carrying an umbrella, and warned against leaving children or pets in parked cars.
And in Bihar, election officials have extended voting hours at some polling stations “in view (of the) prevailing heat wave.”
Ray said the heat isn’t going to stop him from voting on Friday.
“This is the one right we have so of course I will vote, everyone should vote for whomever they want to represent them,” he said.
“Of course it would be good if the election took place in a cooler time but whether I go to vote or not, I am still going to feel hot so that’s not going to stop me.”
Despite the heat warnings, the Election Commision said there are “no major concerns for heat waves” during Friday’s polling and weather forecasts indicate “normal conditions” for the constituencies voting.
Climate politics
India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June. But in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged, with scientists linking some of these longer and more intense heat waves to the climate crisis.
In 2022, a heat wave that killed 90 people across India and Pakistan was made 30 times more likely because of climate change, the World Weather Attribution initiative found.
Last year successive heat waves hit India again, closing schools, damaging crops and putting pressure on energy supplies. In June alone, temperatures in some parts of the country soared to 47 C (116 F), killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses.
The human-caused climate crisis is already threatening India’s development goals and putting millions of people at risk in a nation where more than 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture, studies have found. By 2050, India will be among the places where temperatures have passed survivability limits, according to climate experts.
But analysts say climate has not featured as a major issue this election, despite being mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress.
“Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled ‘climate’,” said Aditya Valiathan Pillai, fellow and coordinator for adaptation and resilience at the New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, in a recent op-ed for CNN.
“You can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.”
Regional impact
Extreme heat has already had an impact across the region this year with little respite from merciless heat and humidity for hundreds of millions of people living in areas most vulnerable to climate change.
Neighboring Bangladesh is sweltering through a heat wave this week with prolonged temperatures above 40 C in many districts and no relief during record hot nights, according to climatologist Maximiliano Herrera. The government declared a “heat alert” across the country on Thursday, in place for 72 hours.
Extreme temperatures are also soaring across Southeast Asia, with dozens of heatstroke deaths report by local media in Thailand, hundreds of schools closed in the Philippines, and droughts drying up rice fields and rivers in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta “rice bowl” region.
The weeks-long heat wave in Vietnam has forced three provinces to declare a state of emergency as salt seeps into fresh water sources, limiting access to drinking water for more than 70,000 households, according to Save the Children.
A report released Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization found that Asia remained the world’s most disaster-affected region in 2023 and the region is heating up faster than the global average."
Scientists find the fingerprints of climate change on Dubai’s deadly floods,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/25/climate/dubai-floods-climate-weather-analysis-int/index.html,"Scientists find the fingerprints of climate change on Dubai’s deadly floods
Follow:
The record-breaking rain that fell over the United Arab Emirates and Oman this month, triggering deadly floods and chaos, was driven partly by the climate crisis, according to a scientific analysis published Thursday, which pointed directly at humans burning fossil fuels.
A team of 21 scientists and researchers, under the World Weather Attribution initiative, found that climate change was making extreme rainfall events in the two countries — which typically fall during El Niño years — between 10 and 40% more intense than they would have been without global warming.
Over a period of less than 24 hours between April 14 and 15, the United Arab Emirates experienced its heaviest rainfall in since records began 75 years ago. Dubai — a glitzy desert city accustomed to going months with no precipitation at all — experienced the equivalent of more than a year and a half’s worth of rain in that time, the analysis said.
Using scientific models, the team was unable to determine precisely how much more likely climate change had made the floods.
However, they concluded global warming was the “most likely” driver of the record rainfall, because the atmosphere in a 1.2-degree warmer world can now hold 8.4% more moisture, which is making extreme rain events more intense. Changing circulation patterns driven by global warming are also increasing rainfall intensity, the analysis noted.
Global warming was the only remaining reason they could identify to explain the heavier downpour.
The floods killed four people in the UAE, and at least 19 others in Oman, including 10 children whose school bus was swept away in the deluge. The extreme weather caused pockets of flooding in several parts of the UAE that could be seen in satellite images from space.
The floods also brought widespread disruption across Dubai. More than 1,000 flights due in and out of Dubai’s airport — the second-busiest in the world — were canceled, and days of delays followed. People were forced to abandon their vehicles on roads inundated by the floods. Three Philippine women working in Dubai died in their car, trapped by waters gushing down the street.
The city’s luxurious malls sprung leaks as rainwater seeped through ceilings, and elevators stopped functioning in skyscrapers, forcing residents to climb stairs up dozens of floors. Unable to return home, some motorists slept in their cars due to blocked roads.
“The UAE and Oman floods have shown that even dry regions can be strongly affected by precipitation events, a threat that is increasing with increasing global warming due to fossil fuel burning,” said Sonia Seneviratne, a professor at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich.
The heavy rain across the two countries came from two separate, powerful, storm systems, said Mansour Almazroui from the King Abdulaziz University’s Center of Excellence for Climate Change Research in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
He added that record ocean temperatures were playing a role in supercharging the storms.
“The Indian Ocean is getting warmer. And the high pressure in the Indian Ocean is surely contributing the rainfall,” he told reporters.
The Arabian Peninsula, on which the UAE and Oman sit, occasionally experiences intense bouts of rain in April and May from what’s known as mesoscale convective systems — several thunderstorms that together act as a single weather system.
Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute in London, said that studies note that these storms are increasing in frequency.
El Niño — a natural oscillation in ocean temperatures that impacts global weather — was also a driving factor in the April rain event, Otto said. However, the focus must be on slowing climate change, she added.
“While we can’t stop El Niño, we can stop climate change,” Otto said. “The solution is to stop burning fossil fuels, to stop deforestation,” she said. Deforestation is responsible for at least 12% of global carbon pollution.
The UAE’s state-owned energy company, ADNOC, has plans for a major expansion of oil and gas production, as CNN has previously reported. The country was widely criticized for electing ADNOC’s CEO, Sultan Al-Jaber, to chair the UN-backed international climate talks in Dubai last year.
The talks had some success, with almost every nation agreeing the world should transition away from fossil fuels.
But many fossil fuel-rich countries are still extracting huge volumes of planet-heating coal, oil and gas, and some are even planning to explore for more oil and build new infrastructure. The International Energy Agency has said the world must end new fossil fuel projects if it wants to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a global science-based goal at the center of the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Nearly half a year on from the climate talks, “countries are still opening new oil and gas fields,” Otto said. “If the world keeps burning fossil fuels, rainfall in many regions of the world will get heavier and heavier, resulting in deadlier and more destructive floods.”

Biden marks Earth Day with new solar energy funds and steps to stand up American Climate Corps,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/22/climate/biden-earth-day-climate/index.html,"Biden marks Earth Day with new solar energy funds and steps to stand up American Climate Corps
Follow:
President Joe Biden traveled to Triangle, Virginia, Monday to mark Earth Day, unveiling $7 billion in grant funding for solar power under the Inflation Reduction Act and announcing new steps to stand up his administration’s American Climate Corps – a program popular with youth climate groups.
The announcements come days after the Biden administration made several significant conservation announcements, including barring oil drilling on nearly half of the national petroleum reserve in Alaska.
Biden touted his climate and clean energy record against a backdrop of green trees in Virginia. He called the climate crisis an “existential threat” that requires “full and clear action.”
“As president, I’ve seen the devastating toll of climate firsthand,” Biden said, speaking of wildfires, extreme weather and deadly heat. “Despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny the climate is in crisis. They want to take us backwards. I’m determined – absolutely determined [that] we move forward.”
Under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All program, the administration announced funding awards to states territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits “to develop long-lasting solar programs that are targeted towards the communities and people who need them most,” EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe told reporters during a Friday call.
Per McCabe, the funding will enable nearly one million households in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from solar power, saving more than $350 million in electric costs annually and more than $8 billion over the life of the program for overburdened households.
Biden also announced new action on the federal Climate Corps – a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing young Americans for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. The government will ease Climate Corps members’ transition to other federal jobs after they graduate from the program.
Biden said service programs like the Climate Corps bring “out the best in young people to do what’s best for America.”
“You’ll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,” Biden added.
He also announced a new partnership between the administration and TradesFutures, the non-profit arm of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, allowing Climate Corps members to access some of the union’s apprenticeship programs.
He also touted an announcement from three states — Vermont, New Mexico and Illinois — launching their own state-based climate corps. Climate corps programs will employ people doing conservation work, as well as work constructing renewable energy like wind and solar.
Biden and other progressive lawmakers, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, delivered remarks in Virginia’s Prince William Forest Park, a site developed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps, on which the American Climate Corps is modeled.
“In the midst of a depression, President Roosevelt called on the American people to come together, to take on the challenge and unlock the opportunity that sat inside of that– the opportunity to heal, to lift folks up, and to move America forward,” White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said Friday. “President Biden will talk about how the United States, in the face of a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together.”"
Can this ocean-based carbon plant help save the world? Some scientists are raising red flags,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/21/climate/equatic-ocean-carbon-removal-plant-climate-intl/index.html,"Can this ocean-based carbon plant help save the world? Some scientists are raising red flags
Editor’s Note: CNN Films ”Blue Carbon: Nature’s Hidden Power” takes viewers from the mangroves of Vietnam to the salt marshes of France to investigate a powerful new ally in the battle to slow climate change. It premieres at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday, April 21.
On a slice of the ocean front in west Singapore, a startup is building a plant to turn carbon dioxide from air and seawater into the same material as seashells, in a process that will also produce “green” hydrogen — a much-hyped clean fuel.
The cluster of low-slung buildings starting to take shape in Tuas will become the “world’s largest” ocean-based carbon dioxide removal plant when completed later this year, according to Equatic, the startup behind it that was spun out of the University of California at Los Angeles.
The idea is that the plant will pull water from the ocean, zap it with an electric current and run air through it to produce a series of chemical reactions to trap and store carbon dioxide as minerals, which can be put back in the sea or used on land.
It’s a compelling vision of a potential solution in the face of a worsening climate crisis that has fueled unprecedented heat and devastating extreme weather. Efforts to rein in global heating remain hugely off track, and many scientists are now warning that, in addition to rapidly reducing fossil fuels, the world will also need to remove carbon pollution humans have already pumped into the atmosphere.
This Singapore plant is one example of a slew of recent projects that are looking to the oceans, which already absorb almost 30% of humanity’s planet-heating pollution, as a tool to do this. Other projects include sprinkling iron particles into the ocean to stimulate CO2-absorbing phytoplankton, sinking seaweed into the depths to lock up carbon and spraying particles into marine clouds to reflect away some of the sun’s energy.
But carbon-removal projects are controversial, criticized for being expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuels. And when they involve the oceans — complex ecosystems already under huge strain from global warming — criticisms can get even louder.
There are “big knowledge gaps” when it comes to ocean geoengineering generally, said Jean-Pierre Gatusso, an ocean scientist at the Sorbonne University in France. “I am very concerned with the fact that science lags behind the industry,” he told CNN.
How it works
Equatic’s technology, which has been tested in small pilot projects in LA and Singapore, requires three main ingredients: seawater, rocks and electricity.
It works like this: The plant pumps in seawater and runs an electric current through it, separating it into four components: two liquids, one acid and one alkaline, and two gases, hydrogen and oxygen.
The acidic water will be mixed with crushed rocks to get the pH back to the same levels as seawater and then sent back into the ocean.
Fans will pump air through the alkaline stream, which causes carbon dioxide to form solid calcium carbonate, the material from which seashells are formed, which will look like a fine sand, as well as dissolved bicarbonate.
The solid and dissolved minerals, which Equatic says can lock up carbon for at least 10,000 years, will be returned to the ocean or used on land. The seawater will also be sent back into the sea, ready to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
None of the processing happens out in the open ocean, said Gaurav Sant, an Equatic founder and professor of sustainability at UCLA, “this is important because it allows you to measure everything that you’re doing perfectly.” This includes the electricity the plant uses as well as the amount of carbon locked away.
The $20 million facility will be fully operational by the end of the year and able to remove 3,650 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, said Edward Sanders, chief operating officer of Equatic, which has partnered with Singapore’s National Water Agency to construct the plant. That amount is equivalent to taking roughly 870 average passenger cars off the road.
The ambition is to scale up to 100,000 metric tons of CO2 removal a year by the end of 2026, and from there to millions of metric tons over the next few decades, Sanders told CNN. The plant can be replicated pretty much anywhere, he said, stacked up in modules “like lego blocks.”
As the plant scales up, they will need to make sure there aren’t negative impacts, Sant told CNN. “There’s a big difference whether you do this on a scale of one ton, versus a million tons, versus a billion tons. You need to measure, you need to monitor, you need to adapt.”
The upfront costs are high but the company says it plans to make money by selling carbon credits to polluters to offset their pollution, as well as selling the hydrogen produced during the process.
Equatic has already signed a deal with Boeing to sell it 2,100 metric tons of hydrogen, which it plans to use to create green fuel, and to fund the removal of 62,000 metric tons of CO2.
Fragile oceans
For some critics, however, the risks far outweigh the benefits.
Lili Fuhr, the director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, criticized the use of “speculative technology” at a time when “climate change is already killing our oceans.”
Processing vast amounts of seawater could kill marine life, Fuhr told CNN. “We already know that power plants kill fish larvae and other marine life. Equatic would process much more seawater per plant than a power plant,” she told CNN, “And thousands of such plants would be needed to make any meaningful impact on the global climate.”
The impacts would need to be closely monitored, said James Niffenegger, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who wrote a report on ocean carbon removal. The “artificial movement of water at this scale is going to be massive,” he told CNN.
The process could also potentially disrupt the delicate balance of ocean chemistry, Niffenegger said. While there is plenty of research into the negative impacts of ocean acidification, there is much less on what might happen if the ocean becomes more alkaline.
There are indications the impacts may be low, he added, but “we’re not going to be able to understand the potential of this solution until we start actually deploying this kind of thing.”
Then there are the energy requirements — as the world moves away from fossil fuels, the demand for clean energy is increasing  exponentially. “Moving seawater would require vast amounts of renewable energy that would be better used to displace fossil fuels in the first place,” Fuhr said.
It’s a point echoed by Gatusso, who said “justice must be considered when precious electricity is used to remove carbon rather than providing it to populations in need.”
Equatic said it filters the seawater to ensure marine life does not enter the system, and that water discharged back into the ocean will have the same composition as normal seawater and will comply with Singapore’s environmental guidelines.
The company also said the production of hydrogen, which could be used to power the process, means its overall energy use is lower than other carbon removal methods.
Equatic’s project encapsulates a broader debate among those who fear rushing into geoengineering could unleash untold damage on ecosystems, versus those who believe the climate crisis is so acute this technology must be an option.
It’s clear which side Equatic is on.
“Inaction is not a climate strategy,” said UCLA’s Sant, adding that it’s vital to be able to make decisions with uncertainty. “If we’re serious about mitigating the trajectory of climate change,” Sant said, “we need to be willing to move, and move quickly at scale.”"

It’s hard to truly comprehend how difficult and relentless a problem climate change is for a country as large as India. One way would be to rig a drone with a very large battery pack and fly it from one end to the other.
Start in the south in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley, in the fall of 2022. Fly very, very slowly northwards until you reach the Himalayas just before the national elections that started this week.
You would witness a country in constant convulsion.
Soon after take off, you’d see the swish houses and gleaming towers of Bangalore’s new tech and corporate elite submerged amid September 2022’s monsoon rains. Just a little further north and a few months on in March 2023, record breaking fires tear through Karnataka state’s forests, the smoke obscuring vision for days.
Then, on to the heaving, humid metropolis of Mumbai at summer’s onset in April 2023 to find over a dozen people dead, mostly women, due to heat exposure at a large public gathering. Next, entire stretches of Delhi under water from flooding in July.
That same summer, hospitals in the sunburnt state of Uttar Pradesh, home to over 240 million people, fill with listless, heat-stroked workers. Finally, the anticipated visual reprieve of the Himalayan snow caps that never comes — instead replaced by an almost snowless winter that continues into 2024.
The impacts of India’s extreme weather are not neatly contained within the country’s borders. This is a global worry. When India introduces wheat export bans due to a heat wave or slows its vaunted IT exports because Bangalore is underwater, the lives of seemingly unconnected millions across the world are affected.
India is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. It is also the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
How India handles climate change, then, is everyone’s concern. But while climate is mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — it will, perhaps surprisingly, not feature as a major issue in India’s six-week-long national election that started this week. That’s unlike in Australia, the UK and US, among others, where elections can be significantly influenced by climate policy positions.
This is because climate politics looks different in the developing world; it will shape Indian elections in definitive but under-the-radar ways. Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled “climate.”
You can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.
Here in the world’s most-populous country, the average Indian does not emit very much at present. India’s relatively low per-capita carbon emissions of 1.9 tons per person are less than half of the global average of 4.7 tons per person — and several times lower than developed economies.
This duality — low per-capita emissions and a rapidly growing economy — also shapes India’s climate policy. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has both pushed the rapid deployment of renewables and domestic green manufacturing to create jobs, while continuing to rely on fossil fuels to power the economy. That’s fairly similar to previous governments.
Leaf through the BJP and Congress’ election manifestos and you will find several dozen pledges across sectors that could be filed under climate policy, with a roughly even split between the two parties (though their emphases predictably differ).
Stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.
Aditya Valiathan Pillai
But these are listed across several chapters and rarely mention the word “climate” (though each has a separate chapter on sustainable development). Similarly, stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.
Parties do however focus on climate-adjacent developmental issues — including expanding entitlements for the poorest (which could also help with weather shocks), creating jobs through green manufacturing and reconfiguring Indian agriculture.
But politics here seems to reflect the relative insignificance of climate change as a conceptual category in the Indian voter’s mind. When tens of thousands of farmers marched through Maharashtra in 2018 after several years of drought across parts of the state, they protested against rising agricultural debt, declining productivity, pests and inadequate irrigation. This was a climate protest in all but slogan.
Take for example a Muslim woman I spoke with a few years ago from the poorer reaches of North Bengal. Her small house in an informal settlement in Delhi was engulfed in a summer fire, and then a few years later her family home in Bengal was damaged in a monsoon flood.
She supports a large family of children and grandchildren as a house cleaner in Delhi’s rich neighbourhoods. Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care.
Elections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy.
This pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon.
The hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow.
The climate crisis also deepens the case for global cooperation. India’s climate-outages are going to be hard for trading partners and global markets to ignore as its economy grows. Domestic politics that focus on immediate developmental goals rather than long-term climate-proofing creates a gaping hole that global adaptation finance must fill.
This has a moral dimension, too. The climate impacts buffeting India today are largely because of the historical emissions of developed counterparts.
Global resilience must be a priority in an interconnected world. The climate impacts buffeting the most populous nation on earth aren’t just a domestic issue — they’re an international one.

Climate change will make you poorer, according to a new report
Follow:
Record-breaking heat waves, severe floods and acute wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, carry a colossal price tag: an approximately 19% reduction in global income over just the next 26 years, a new study published Wednesday found.
That financial gut punch won’t just affect big governments and corporations. According to the United Nations, the world is heading toward a gain of nearly 3 degrees of global warming in the next century, even with current climate policies and goals – and researchers say individuals could bear the economic burden.
The researchers in Wednesday’s study, published in Nature, said financial pain in the short-term is inevitable, even if governments ramp up their efforts to tackle the crisis now.
“These impacts are unavoidable in the sense that they are indistinguishable across different future emission scenarios until 2049,” two of the study’s researchers from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Maximilian Kotz and Leonie Wenz, told CNN via email.
However, they say immediate actions to reduce climate change could stem some losses in the longer term.
Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor and environmental researcher at Stanford University, said the economic damage from climate change will take different shapes. Not only can extreme weather events result in costly repairs to damaged property, but elevated temperatures can also impact agriculture, labor productivity, and even cognitive ability in some cases.
It’s not too late to prevent future losses
While discourse about the cost of climate change often refers to potentially expensive mitigation efforts like curbing oil and gas use or technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis.
Researchers estimated it would cost the global economy $6 trillion by 2050 to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement—the international agreement among nearly 200 nations to tackle climate change—compared to the study’s estimated $38 trillion economic damage due to climate change.
“Adaptation could offer ways to reduce these damages,” the researchers Kotz and Wenz said.
Bernardo Bastien, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said that adaptation strategies, which are approaches designed not to reduce climate change, but to respond by limiting its negative effects, could help save money on a longer time horizon.
Bastien gave an example: utility companies in the state of California that have shut down the electrical grid to prevent wildfires.
“When you turn off electrical grids, you’re turning off industry and you’re turning off a lot of households that use electricity for their well-being,” Bastien said. “It’s very costly but very necessary.”
And while the study concludes some economic damage is guaranteed before 2049, its authors argue that benefits from curbing climate change could emerge a few decades down the line.
“Damage estimates diverge strongly across emission scenarios after 2049, conveying the clear benefits from mitigation from a purely economic point of view,” the study said.
Poorer countries see a larger income drag
However, the expected financial hit won’t be distributed evenly.
Diffenbaugh, who was not associated with the study, said that while research showing the aggregate impact of climate change is important, “embedded in those aggregate impacts are very stark disparities in who is most impacted by climate change.”
“We have clear evidence that overall, the poor are harmed more,” he said. “That’s what’s likely to happen from the global warming that’s already occurred and what’s likely to happen even for small increments of global warming.”
The Nature study estimated the economic damage of different regions. North America and Europe are expected to see a lower income reduction in the next 26 years at 11%, compared to South Asia and Africa at 22%.
The United States, a historically large polluter, will take a smaller economic hit than some neighboring countries, according to the study. However, it won’t be spared from disruptions caused by a warming planet — especially younger generations of Americans.
A different paper, published Tuesday in Consumer Reports from global consulting firm ICF, estimates that the lifetime personal cost of climate change for a baby born in the US in 2024 could be as high as $500,000.
The ICF paper said price hikes on essential elements of the cost of living in the US will add up due to climate change. Housing costs are projected to increase by $125,000 over the lifetime of a person born in 2024, owing to elevated maintenance and insurance costs due to the risks of flooding and other weather-related damage, the paper said. Food prices are also seen rising by an estimated $33,000 over the lifetime of a 2024 baby, due to disruptions to agriculture and supply chains, the paper said. Other expenses, like energy, transportation and health care, are expected to balloon in the next few decades, as well.
“For many Americans, this financial loss will require difficult decisions about how to pay for food, housing, and other daily expenses, which climate change will increase by approximately 9 percent over their lifetime,” the paper said.

It’s not just ocean heat that’s affecting marine life – new research shows extremely cold events are welling up and causing mass mortalities. And the same planet-warming pollution that’s driving the climate crisis is likely to blame for these “killer events” on the other end of the temperature spectrum.
The world’s oceans have been plagued by unprecedented heat over the past year, fueling concerns for marine life. Billions of crabs disappeared in the northern Pacific; sea lions and dolphins are washing up sick; iconic coral reefs are undergoing mass bleaching.
But even as ocean temperatures climb, extremely cold upwelling events — when strong winds and ocean currents bring pockets of cold water up to the surface, replacing the warm water that was there — are also becoming more frequent and intense, threatening sea life, according to the study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
“Climate change is actually really complex,” said Nicolas Lubitz, lead author of the study and a researcher at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. “It’s not just warming of the globe, but it’s really changing the way our oceans function.”
When Lubitz heard reports of marine animals like sharks, manta rays and squids washing up dead in the southeast coast of South Africa in March 2021, he started investigating. More than 260 marine animals from 81 different species died in that one extreme event.
He said seasonal upwelling events are common in that area, with water temperature dropping quickly. But Lubitz said the March 2021 die-off was “quite an extreme event, because we had rather warm water before it happened.”
“And then the winds changed, and the currents started changing slightly, which is a seasonal thing,” he added. “Then all of a sudden, the temperature within 24 hours dropped by 11 degrees.”
The researchers analyzed killer upwelling events in the Indian Ocean’s Agulhas Current and the East Australian Current, using 41 years of sea surface temperature data and 33 years of wind records to see how deadly cold ocean extremes can be.
“We’re seeing changes in how often the upwelling occurs, how intense it is, which might impact the fishing communities in these areas,” he said. “It’s really an economic thing as well as the biodiversity thing.”
According to the study, the lethality of a cold event is likely linked to how fast the temperature drops. If the cold event lasts for multiple days, which has been occurring more frequently, research shows that marine animals including turtles and many fish species could suffer from hypothermia and physiological malfunction or ultimately die.
For a different study, Lubitz already had bull sharks electronically tagged with a transmitting locator device, which also recorded the depth and temperature of the part of the ocean they swim to.
“That was really the key in this study in that we could see when the sharks migrate,” he said. “We could see how the temperature profiles change, and how the sharks were swimming shallower when they were in upwelling areas because they were trying to avoid the colder water from the depths.”
The findings provide a “very reasonable explanation” to the many unexpected marine mortality events people have been seeing around the world, said Ajit Subramaniam, research professor with Columbia University’s Climate School’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“It’s one of those unexpected findings and it’s not something we talk about a lot,” Subramaniam, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. “And therefore, this is a timely thing to remind us that the climate crisis works in both ways.”"
Should we reconsider having children due to fears about the climate crisis?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/climate-crisis-parenting-bill-weir-wellness/index.html,"Should we reconsider having children due to fears about the climate crisis?

Record-breaking heat, rising sea levels, increasingly extreme weather and more are fueled by the human-made climate crisis.
It doesn’t feel like a great time to be raising children, or having them in the first place. But maybe it still is, if we can counter fear with knowledge and hope.
I chatted with Bill Weir, CNN’s Chief Climate Correspondent and host of the CNN Original Series “The Wonder List with Bill Weir,” about these topics, and about his new book, “Life As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate, and Hope in a Changing World,” written as an open letter to his own kids.
This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
David Allan: Are you fundamentally an optimistic or pessimistic person by nature?
Bill Weir: It depends on the day. I find that covering this beat, my mood is directly proportional to what I’m focused on. Some days it is a firehose of peer-reviewed dread and just more signs of how many ways humanity is wrecking the planet.
But the days when I focus on the problem solvers, the dreamers, the doers, the folks who know that there’s a better future, (those days) heal the soul.
When I actually sat down to write this book, we were in a very dark place nationally. And I found enough positive stories, I saw enough momentum going the right way, that most days I wake up now with more wonder than worry.
The fight has just begun, and so much can be saved. And so much is worth saving. That’s the ethic I’m trying to pass down to my kids: to be clear-eyed about the challenges, but full of courage and hope for the solutions.
Allan: On one hand, you wrote “The United States of America I knew and loved is gone … eaten from the inside by metastasized lies fed to furious people in forgotten places.” On the other hand, you intentionally had a child in the last few years. What would you say to someone who feels conflicted about having a baby right now?
Weir: I would say we need all the good help we can get. And if you believe that your child is going to be a net positive for humanity, go for it. I think our basic purpose in life is to procreate. Nature wants replication and hopefully improvement for the next generation.
It’s a very first-world problem to think about whether or not you have children. It’s tough for people, and I totally understand the psychology around this sort of thing, because we haven’t really come to grips with the mental stress of climate change. We haven’t processed through the ﻿five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) as they pertain to the climate to realize what we’ve lost. And we have to reach acceptance to what we need to build in order to survive and thrive.
There are family counselors who deal with parents who are in the grips of this grief. They still want to expand their family (but) are so worried about what the future might bring. I think that’s a valid concern, and there was a time when I completely understood where those folks were coming from. But I’m so glad my little boy is here. He gives me inspiration that I otherwise might not have. He gives me perspective. I think that I’m a believer that humans can be a net positive for the planet. And most people want to be, and it really comes down to the stories we tell ourselves.
Allan: Young people are worried about the climate. Some 84% of 10,000 people ages 16 to 25 years old across 10 countries were either moderately or extremely worried about climate change, according to a 2021 survey published in the Lancet Planet Health. More than 50% in the study said they felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless and guilty about it. And more than 45% said their feelings on the topic negatively affect their daily life and functioning. You cite a similar study in your book. What would you say to these teens and young adults? Or what do you say, because your daughter is in that age range, right?
Weir: She’s 20. Well, I say “sorry” to begin with. We’re sorry our intended and unintended consequences have scrambled their futures. They can’t take for granted the things that I took for granted – air, water, temperature, how you build shelter, how you grow food – they don’t have the luxury of ignoring those things.
My dad used to say to me, anytime I had problems, “Good thing you’re tough.” And so I feel like we have to raise a generation of resilient children and model for them what that looks like. We have to be constantly vigilant about unexpected, unnatural disasters. And we have to talk to each other in communities about these sorts of things.
I think a big reason for these spikes in climate anxiety in these polls are the result of us not talking about it. The result of adults not having honest conversations about what we’re losing, what’s worth saving, the decisions we have to make, because there are no easy decisions anymore. We have to do brutal math on what is worth saving and what is worth letting go. I think it’s only through these conversations we get through the five stages of climate grief and reach the end of that, which is acceptance.
Allan: I love this detail about the birth of your son, River, that he was conceived in a lighthouse during the pandemic. It’s the perfect metaphor, a beacon of light, of hope in the darkness. To carry that metaphor just a bit further, another feature of lighthouses is that they are built to withstand the worst of nature, and are often isolated to the point that they need to be self-sufficient. Are self-sufficiency and fortitude virtues you think parents need to put greater emphasis on now?
Weir: Yes, absolutely. My dad was a bit of a misanthrope who loved to be alone. And he raised me with that sense of John Muir romanticism about living in a cabin in the woods. But John Muir was using an ax that was made in a factory somewhere, by other people who didn’t have the luxury of going off the grid. We need everybody. We need all hands on deck together these days.
In terms of teaching resilience and independence, as a personality trait, I think that is vital. But I want my kids to be plugged into their communities, to be civically engaged, too. To know their power as citizens and conscious consumers. To be the kind of neighbor who makes everyone around them stronger, come what may.
Allan: I have two children myself, ages 12 and 16. And when I talk to them about the climate crisis, I find myself trying to spin it a bit, to counteract the doom with optimism of reversing the course that we’re on, of government action, scientific breakthroughs, stories of people making change. How do we find that balance in daily conversation with our kids of being honest, but not hopeless?
Weir: I’m trying to strike that balance all the time. The best advice I ever got for leading a climate beat in this part of my life came from Mr. Rogers, who famously said anytime he saw a scary event on television his mother told him to “look for the helpers;” there are always helpers rushing into the scene. And this book is dedicated to the helpers, not just the first responders that I meet in these disaster zones, but the countless folks living lives of quiet service and moving us in a more positive direction.
The helpers lift me up – the idea that the same frontal lobes that built the problem as we exploded as a species, can solve them once we come together. There’s so much that can be done. There’s so much that can be saved."

The death of a toddler from extreme heat highlighted the risk of climate-related illnesses across Malaysia. The same week, Vietnam declared a state of emergency after abnormally high temperatures in the south dried up entire rice fields. And in the Philippines, hundreds of schools suspended classes after daily temperatures soared past 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).
Sweltering heat is back in Southeast Asia, one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change. And it is not going away any time soon, scientists have warned.
Home to more than 675 million people across 11 countries, the region has seen temperatures reach unprecedented levels – with little respite from merciless heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN.
Thailand has been worst hit, Herrera said, adding that heat forecasts there have been especially dire. Temperatures across the country had been “breaking non-stop records” for 13 months – and heat and humidity levels were relentless, he said.
“We thought temperatures last year were unbearable but (what we are seeing) this year has beaten that – temperatures in Bangkok won’t drop below 30 degrees Celsius, even at night for the rest of April,” Herrera told CNN.
“The trend is inescapable. The region has to prepare for terrible heat for the rest of April and most of May.”
On April 3, as Thailand entered its annual dry season, the capital Bangkok clocked temperatures of around 109 degrees Fahrenheit – prompting many to stay indoors in air-conditioned comfort.
In nearby Vietnam, the heat wave brought intense droughts to the south – driving temperatures up to nearly 104 degrees Fahrenheit and wreaking havoc on the country’s vital agriculture industry. Vietnam is one of the world’s largest rice exporters and low rainfall spells trouble for farmers in its Mekong delta region.
Rice fields and rivers have dried up, according to Vietnamese media reports, and farmers have been struggling without rainwater for their crops.
Record heat waves in 2023 caused severe power outages in several cities. This year, Vietnamese meteorologists have attributed the unusually long dry spell to El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and influences weather all over the world.
But alongside these natural variations, the world continues to blast through climate records, with deadly heat waves becoming the norm.
‘No definitive end’
Though average temperatures in Southeast Asia have risen every decade since 1960, experts say one of the most worrying characteristics of the heat wave now sweeping across the region is its prolonged duration - with no end in sight.
Researchers from Swiss climate research group IQ Air attributed the current heat wave to “a combination of factors which include human-induced climate change and the El Niño event.”
“This phenomenon has led to unprecedented high temperatures across the region,” IQ Air said in a statement on April 5. “There is currently no definitive end date projected as an abatement to the heat will depend on factors such as weather patterns and (government) mitigation efforts.”
One mitigation effort being considered in Malaysia is cloud seeding, injecting particles into clouds – usually from an airplane – to make it rain.
“Our air assets are always ready,” said Adly Zahari, the deputy defense minister. “Cloud seeding should take into account various weather factors such as cloud conditions and the wind before it is carried out.”
At least two heat-related fatalities have been reported in the country – a 22-year-old man from the northern state of Pahang and a 3-year-old boy, in neighboring Kelantan. Both died of heatstroke, according to health officials.
Officials in Sabah, a state on Borneo island, also reported close to 300 fires that started at farms, plantations and forests throughout February.
Climate change has made “Malaysia vulnerable to extreme heat,” the country’s Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said on the sidelines of a talk in late March following heatstroke cases. “We are thankful that we have not yet reached the third level of extreme heat waves but this could happen at any time.”
But there is still much to be done, say some living in the capital Kuala Lumpur.
Like many Malaysians, university student Aidil Iman Aidid has been trying to adapt to the ongoing heat, especially in recent weeks when he fasted for Ramadan. “This year’s Ramadan has been the hottest and most challenging,” he told CNN, while staying hydrated was especially tricky, given that hot days “now feel much longer.”
“We are living in extreme weather conditions,” said Aidil, adding that he often woke up thirsty and tired after taking naps during the fasting period.
“There’s so much to be done and I really want to see governments across the region not just adapting (but also) establishing greater climate resilience against extreme hazards,” he said.
In Singapore, some schools have told students to wear cooler, looser gym gear until further notice, given persistently high temperatures in recent weeks.
“We are continuing to monitor the heat situation and well-being of students and staff closely – especially those who may be more vulnerable to the effects of higher temperature conditions,” an Education Ministry spokesperson told CNN.
Similar actions were taken by hundreds of schools in the Philippines, including dozens in the capital Manila, that canceled classes after temperatures reached unbearable levels.
But watchdog groups have expressed concerns about children’s safety.
“Educators and local authorities have been forced to take the extreme decision to shut hundreds of schools because this extreme heat means children are simply unable to concentrate in the classroom and their health is also at risk,” said a statement by Save The Children Philippines.
“We need to see urgent action now to limit warming to a maximum of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
“Failing to do this will have dramatic consequences for children’s health, safety and wellbeing.”"
Earliest look at hurricane season is calling for more storms than it’s ever predicted,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/weather/hurricane-season-forecast-climate/index.html,"Earliest look at hurricane season is calling for more storms than it’s ever predicted
Follow:
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season isn’t here yet, but is already shaping up to be one for the books, with more hurricanes and named storms predicted in a pre-season forecast from Colorado State University than ever before.
This June through November could see 23 named storms in all, including 11 hurricanes and five Category 3 or higher “major” hurricanes, according to the university’s Atlantic hurricane season forecast, released Thursday.
“This is the most active April forecast that we have ever issued,” lead forecaster Phil Klotzbach told CNN. “Our prior highest hurricane forecast in April was 9 hurricanes, which we have called for several times” since the forecasts began in 1995.
With the caveat that early outlooks aren’t set in stone given the “considerable changes that can occur in the atmosphere-ocean between April and the peak” of the season, it’s still an ill omen for a particularly active storm season.
And, researchers say they have “above-normal confidence” for this April’s predictions.
“We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,” the group said in a news release.
On average, the Atlantic season brings 14 named storms, with seven hurricanes, three of them major. Last hurricane season had 20 named storms including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.
The only other Colorado State outlooks to predict this many hurricanes were mid-season forecasts in August 2005 and 2020 – which ended up being the two most-active Atlantic seasons on record.
“The highest number of hurricanes that we have predicted at any lead time is 12 … which we forecast in August of 2020,” Klotzbach said, adding that was still an undershot, with 14 hurricanes total that year. “We also forecast 11 hurricanes in August of 2005. That season ended up with 15 hurricanes.”
The researchers will issue updates to the forecast on June 11, July 9 and August 6.
El Niño to La Niña
With the forecast in, the next question is: Why?
You may have heard talk of El Niño during last year’s hurricane season. Now, we’ll be dealing with the opposite natural climate phenomenon, La Niña, and its potential impacts will be key this season.
El Niño is when the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific are warmer than normal.
El Niño heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe; it also influences global weather, including cyclone seasons. When the Pacific is warmer, the region typically sees more tropical cyclones, but the Atlantic sees fewer, thanks to more upper-level winds that rip apart storms and prevent them from forming.
As El Niño’s opposite, La Niña suppresses those upper-level winds, making conditions ideal for hurricane formation and intensification.
There is a 55% chance for La Niña to develop from June to August and a 77% chance from September to November, according to a March forecast from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
A warm world favors hurricanes
The overarching impacts of climate change are also, as ever, at play.
Planet-warming pollution is driving global and ocean temperature rise, and the world’s oceans have now experienced an entire year of unprecedented heat thanks to this human-caused warming and El Niño.
And as the planet warms, the impacts of hurricanes are becoming more dangerous.
Global sea levels are also on the rise, driven mainly by the rapid melting of ice sheets and glaciers. A rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland a hurricane’s storm surge can travel.
A warmer climate also means there will be more water vapor available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain.
The water in the Atlantic, particularly where most hurricanes form, has been record-warm. A warm Atlantic in spring usually means warmer water during hurricane season because it creates conditions that stop water-cooling winds from forming, Colorado State University researchers said in Thursday’s news release.
And more warm water means more chances for storms.
“A very warm Atlantic favors an above-average season, since a hurricane’s fuel source is warm ocean water,” the release said. “In addition, a warm Atlantic leads to lower atmospheric pressure and a more unstable atmosphere. Both conditions favor hurricanes.”

Follow:
More than 24 million people in southern Africa face hunger, malnutrition and water scarcity due to drought and floods, an aid group has warned, as experts say the situation risks spiraling into an “unimaginable humanitarian situation.”
The warning from Oxfam on Wednesday came as Zimbabwe joined other southern African nations in declaring its drought a national disaster, following earlier declarations by Zambia and Malawi.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said more than 2.7 million people in the country will go hungry this year and more than $2 billion in aid is required for the country’s national response, Reuters reported.
The country’s top priority “is securing food for all Zimbabweans,” the president told journalists at the state house in Harare. “No Zimbabwean must succumb to, or die from, hunger.”
The drought has been fueled by El Niño, a natural climate pattern originating in the Pacific Ocean along the equator, which tends to bring high temperatures and low rainfall to this part of Africa. When it does rain, dried-out ground is unable to absorb the moisture, making flooding more likely.
El Niño is exacerbating the impacts of the climate crisis, caused primarily by burning fossil fuels, which is driving more frequent and severe weather — including drought and floods — across southern Africa, a region Oxfam describes as a “climate disaster hotspot.”
As southern Africa enters its traditional dry season this month, vast parts of the region — including Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have already been grappling with a prolonged dry spell.
From late January to February, rainfall levels were the lowest in at least 40 years, a recent report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs revealed.
Central parts of the region experienced the driest February in more than 100 years, according to a report by the United States Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network.
In Zambia, Malawi and Central Mozambique, extreme drought has damaged more than  2 million hectares of crops, Oxfam said.
Zambia declared its drought a disaster on February 29.
Malawi’s president declared a state of disaster across the majority of the country on March 23. It’s the fourth consecutive year the country has been forced to do this due to the impact of extreme weather conditions. The World Food Programme said this week the El Niño impact is “exacerbating the devastating effects of the climate crisis in Malawi.”
Southern Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change despite being responsible for only a tiny portion of global planet-heating pollution.
In Mozambique — a country accounting for only 0.2% of global emissions — 3 million people face hunger, according to Oxfam. The country’s capital, Maputo, experienced devastating floods in March, after Tropical Storm Filipo hit followed a few weeks later by further intense rainfall.
“It is so deeply unjust that climate change impacts are hammering Mozambique over and over again. One of the poorest countries in the world is carrying the costs of the climate crisis it has done little to cause and is being pushed deeper into debt and spiralling poverty,” Teresa Anderson, ActionAid’s International Climate Justice Lead, said last week following the flooding.
“Wealthy polluting  countries need to own up to their responsibility for the damage they are  doing through climate change and be willing to provide climate finance  so that vulnerable communities can cope with the climate disasters that  are being unleashed,” she added.
Oxfam’s southern Africa program director, Machinda Marongwe, said the region is “in crisis” and called on donors to “immediately release resources” to prevent the spiral into an “unimaginable humanitarian situation.”
“With all these countries facing multiple crises simultaneously, the urgency cannot be overstated,” Marongwe said."

The world’s oceans have now experienced an entire year of unprecedented heat, with a new temperature record broken every day, new data shows.
Global ocean surface temperatures started breaking daily records in mid-March last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, fueling concerns for marine life and extreme weather across the planet.
“The amplitude by which previous sea surface temperature records were beaten in 2023, and now again in 2024, is remarkable,” said Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK.
Global average ocean temperatures in 2023 were 0.25 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous year, said Gregory C. Johnson, a NOAA oceanographer. That rise is “is equivalent to about two decades’ worth of warming in a single year,” he told CNN. “So it is quite large, quite significant, and a bit surprising.”
Scientists have said ocean heat is being supercharged by human-caused global warming, boosted by El Niño, a natural climate pattern marked by higher-than-average ocean temperatures.
The main consequences are on marine life and global weather. Global ocean warmth can add more power to hurricanes and other extreme weather events, including scorching heat waves and intense rainfall.
High ocean temperatures are already proving catastrophic for coral. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is experiencing its seventh mass bleaching event, authorities announced in March following aerial surveys.
Bleaching occurs when heat-stressed corals release the algae that live in their tissue and provide their food source. If ocean temperatures remain too high for too long, the coral can starve and die.
Data from NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch tool shows that the problem goes well beyond Australia, and that the world could face a fourth global mass coral bleaching event in the next few months.
Ocean heat sets the stage for more ferocious hurricanes. “The warmer the ocean, the more energy to fuel storms is available,” said Karina von Schuckmann, an oceanographer at Mercator Ocean International in France.
Temperatures have been unprecedented in the North Atlantic, an area of ocean key to hurricane formation, surprising some scientists, who are still trying to unpick the exact causes.
“At times, the records (in the North Atlantic) have been broken by margins that are virtually statistically impossible,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School told CNN.
If very high ocean temperatures continue into the second half of 2024 and a La Niña event develops — El Niño’s counterpart that tends to amplify Atlantic hurricane season — “this would increase the risk of a very active hurricane season,” Hirschi said.
About 90% of the world’s excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels is stored in the oceans. “Measuring ocean warming allows us to track the status and evolution of planetary warming,” Schuckmann told CNN. “The ocean is the sentinel for global warming.”
El Niño is weakening and predicted to dissipate over the next few months, which could level off the record ocean temperatures, especially if the cooling effects of La Niña replace it.
“In the past, surface temperature values have decreased after the passage of El Niño,” Schuckmann said. But, she added, it’s currently impossible to predict when ocean heat will drop below record levels.
While natural climate variability will cause ocean temperatures to fluctuate, over the long term, NOAA’s Johnson said, we should expect them to “continue to break records as long as greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise.”

After weeks of spring-like warmth, parts of the United States will briefly plunge back into winter this week, with below-freezing temperatures possible for much of the eastern half of the country.
Tuesday marks the official start of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere after the warmest winter on record.
But it seems Mother Nature has the seasons mixed up, because spring will feel more like winter early this week. More than half the US population will experience temperatures at or below freezing.
The cold isn’t just an anomaly, it will pose a risk for agricultural interests in the Southeast with the growing season underway there. Freeze warnings stretch from Texas to North Carolina because of the risk to crops.
The chilly weather will be a shock for many in the eastern half of the country experiencing warmer than average temperatures this past week. Many southern cities had highs in the 70s on Saturday – but that changed Sunday as cold crept into the Midwest and progressed south and east.
Colder air has become widespread across much of the eastern half of the country Monday and will keep most of the region quite chilly Tuesday.
St Louis could see more than a 20-degree swing from the high 60s Saturday to the low 40s Monday. Atlanta’s high temperature could drop by as much as 15 degrees from Saturday to Monday, from the low 70s to the mid-50s.
These temperatures might not be frigid, but in parts of the South they’re more typical for the heart of winter.
Memphis, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama, are both forecast to see a high temperature around 50 degrees on Monday – more typical for mid-January.
The cold air will continue to spread east Monday night into Tuesday, finally reaching much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. New York City will drop from a high of 61 degrees Saturday to the mid-40s Tuesday.
Philadelphia’s high temperature on Tuesday is expected to be in the upper 40s, more typical of late February.
Low temperatures will also be dropping. Temperatures in the Southeast Tuesday morning will be 10 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of the year. Atlanta, Charlotte, and Birmingham, Alabama, are all expected to see temperatures drop into the low 30s Tuesday morning, presenting the greatest risk to plants.
The timing of this potential freeze is not out of the ordinary. Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta experienced their final freeze right around the spring equinox last year. But the threat to plant life is more substantial given the warmth preceding it.
“Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing,” the National Weather Service in Atlanta said.
Bringing plants indoors is the easiest way to protect them from a hard freeze, but if you can’t do that, covering them can also help.
Sheets, towels or blankets can be used to help trap the radiant heat from the ground around the plants. Use stakes with your plant coverings or drape them over patio furniture so they don’t crush the plant.
Temperatures will rebound rather quickly across the Southeast by the end of the week, so hang on to that sunscreen and allergy medicine, as spring will be in full swing shortly."

The map shows the world’s most significant “climate anomalies,” or weather events that were unexpected for this time of year.
In Antarctica, one of the coldest places on Earth, sea ice was second-lowest on record, tied for 2022, as scientists worry the climate crisis is having a stronger impact on this isolated region.
The Northern Hemisphere also experienced an unusually warm winter. Not only did Great Lakes ice cover reach historic lows last month, it was also the warmest February on record for North America and Europe, disrupting local economies that rely on winter recreational activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Meanwhile, parts of the planet also saw water-related disasters on both ends of the spectrum — dry and wet. As Ecuador and Madagascar faced heavy rainfall and destructive flooding, parts of southern Africa saw one of the driest Februarys in 40 years.
Correction: A previous version of this story misstated how low Antarctic sea ice was last month. It was the second-lowest extent on record."

States are hoping to pay for these upgrades using $4.6 billion in money from the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Environmental Protection Agency will roll out in the coming months.
Even as the Biden administration has moved aggressively to try to curb climate pollution, the approach from states has been piece-meal, with just 33 states previously having plans on the books. That 45 states and dozens of cities are either forming new plans or updating their old ones is significant, said Jennifer Macedonia, a deputy assistant administrator at the EPA.
“This is quite remarkable and new to have this breadth of coverage,” Macedonia told CNN. “This is quite unprecedented in terms of comprehensive climate action plans across states, and we also have metropolitan areas covering the country as well.”
Five states declined to compete for the federal climate funds: Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, South Dakota and Wyoming.
But those states have cities and metropolitan areas that raised their hands for the funding, including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa in Florida; Cedar Rapids and Des Moines in Iowa; Louisville and Lexington in Kentucky; Rapid City in South Dakota; and Cheyenne in Wyoming.
Over 96% of the US population will be covered by a climate action plan, Macedonia said, which will both help states track their emissions and submit projects for funding.
There are a wide variety of projects states and cities want funding for.
Fargo, North Dakota, plans to upgrade most of its inefficient streetlights to LED bulbs, which would save money and cut pollution. The Utah Transit Authority is hoping to use the money to buy 15 electric buses for public transit in Salt Lake County, and to create a new voluntary electric school bus program for schools. And the state of Alabama wants to put more solar panels in rural areas to help power farm irrigation systems.
“We’re seeing electricity sector proposals to update the grid and deploy renewable energy, including in Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona,” Macedonia said. “For states that have significant agricultural sectors, we’re seeing proposals about sustainable soil management.”
But tension around the clean energy transition is still evident in some states’ plans.
West Virginia, a state that still relies almost entirely on coal for electricity, has sued the EPA several times to halt regulations that would target coal-fired power plants and heavy industry. The state did not commit to phasing out coal in its plan, but said it would invest in cleaner energy sources like nuclear and hydropower. It also said it intends to focus on preventing leaks of methane, a super-polluting greenhouse gas, from its abandoned coal mines.
Many of the states go into remarkable detail on their climate pollution and ways to cut it.
In the coming years, states that receive IRA money will be required to demonstrate how they’re using the funds to achieve the climate and energy goals they laid out in their plans.

This simple solution could bring some chill to scorching summer heat,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/climate/urban-heat-climate-solution-retroreflectors/index.html,"This simple solution could bring some chill to scorching summer heat
Follow:
Summers are becoming increasingly dangerous, especially in cities where the warming effects of tall buildings, concrete and asphalt send temperatures soaring. But there might be a simple, potentially inexpensive way to put a chill on urban heat: retroreflectors.
A study published Monday in the journal Nature Cities found when retroreflective material was installed on buildings, it decreased the surface temperature of those buildings by up to 36 degrees Fahrenheit, and air temperatures by nearly 5 degrees.
Reducing building temperature is “very, very important” for pedestrians at street level, said Elie Bou-Zeid, co-author of the study and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University, “because those walls radiate a lot of heat on you.”
Cooling those surfaces by 36 degrees “will make you feel significantly more comfortable,” he said. “It’s almost like being in the shade.”
Cities are significantly warmer than their surrounding suburbs and rural areas because of the way they are built. Tall buildings, dark roofs, asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s rays and reflect its energy back into the environment as heat – the so-called urban heat island effect.
Urban designers have started to implement simple solutions to counteract the urban heat phenomenon, including painting roads white, planting more trees and building green roofs. But researchers say using retroreflective materials would have a more powerful cooling effect.
Retroreflectors take advantage of a simple concept: three mirrors in the shape of a cube corner reflect light back in the direction it came from. The same can be achieved with a mirror in the shape of a bowl.
They’re used in road signs and bicycle reflectors, for instance, to ensure headlights reflect to drivers’ eyes. They’re also used in running clothes with reflective strips on them. Cats’ eyes have similar, naturally occurring retroreflectors, which is why they appear to glow when you shine a light on them.
Bou-Zeid said retroreflective material could be developed as sheets or coatings to install on city surfaces. Given the material itself is relatively inexpensive, it could be a low-cost solution to an increasingly dangerous phenomenon, as temperatures continue to climb due to planet-warming pollution.
Small-scale versions of the idea have already been tested in the Netherlands and Italy. But there is no large-scale example yet because of how difficult it is to retrofit existing buildings.
“The building industry in general is a little bit slow to adopt new technology,” Bou-Zeid told CNN. “What we were hoping with this paper at least is to show that retroreflective material has a lot of cooling potential. And the next step would be to develop this technology, which already exists, but in buildings.”
Some US cities have taken steps to tackle extreme heat. Los Angeles streets were painted with a grayish-white coating to reflect sunlight and keep air temperatures cooler – just like a light shirt will keep you cooler than a dark one in the hot summer sun. But researchers say this solution is less effective than retroreflective material, which reflects sunlight back toward the sun “and not to other objects on the ground,” Bou-Zeid said.
There is one downside to it, though: It would make winters feel even colder – reflecting sunlight at a time when it’s beneficial – which could create new public health concerns. Bou-Zeid said it might be possible to design reflective materials that “turn off” when needed.
“When it’s very hot during the summer, they become white and reflect a lot back to the sky,” Bou-Zeid said. “When it’s very cold during the winter, they become black and don’t reflect a lot and mostly absorb (the sun’s) energy.”
To help reduce the urban impact of the climate crisis, cities need to implement as many measures as they can to adapt to and mitigate these changes, said Xinjie Huang, the lead author of the study and doctoral researcher at Princeton.
“It should be noted that retroreflective surface, or any other single heat adaptation strategy, cannot be a ‘silver bullet’ for diverse urban environments worldwide,” Huang told CNN. Instead, “a multi-technology cooling portfolio with cooling techniques tailored to localized conditions is required to combat the exacerbating urban heat stress globally.”"

Follow:
The final chapter of winter has been written and it’s the story of a season that didn’t live up to its name.
This winter was the warmest on record for the Lower 48, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information said Friday. Records date to the late 1800s.
The record warmth has left vast areas of the country without typical amounts of snow and ice, fueling a worsening drought in the Midwest and disrupting local economies.
It’s another clear signal that global temperatures are on the rise due to human-caused planet-warming emissions.
Five of the 10 warmest winters on record in the US have occurred in the last 20 years as winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the country.
A normal winter was hard to come by, according to an index from the Midwest Regional Climate Center which tracks the aggregate toll of cold and snow at hundreds of locations across the country.
Places with more cold and snow have “severe” or even “extreme” winters as it builds over time, whereas locations with less of both experience mild winters. Dozens of locations have experienced the mildest winter since 1950.
Winter warmth started off at a blistering pace. December was the warmest on record for the Lower 48, a full 7.3 degrees Fahrenheit above average. Aside from one brutal cold spell in January, it continued through the season, with February finishing as the third-warmest on record.
Unusual February heat wasn’t limited to the US. February was the Earth’s hottest on record, marking the ninth month in a row global records tumbled, according to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service.
In the US, a classic El Niño pattern had a strong hand in amplifying temperatures, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast where winter felt more like spring.
Eight states experienced a record-warm winter: North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.
Temperatures were several degrees above normal in dozens of cities from the north-central US to the Northeast – another clear indicator of exceptional warmth.
More than two dozen other states experienced one of their 10-warmest winters on record. It was also one of the 10-warmest winters for many other cities in the northern half of the US, including the entire I-95 corridor from Portland, Maine, to Richmond, Virginia.
The prolonged warmth still prevented many heavy snow events in the Northeast and Midwest, creating an ongoing snow drought measured in feet of missing snow.
Despite finally ending a years-long wait for substantial snow, New York City and Philadelphia experienced snowfall deficits this winter. It was New York City’s fourth-warmest winter on record and Philadelphia’s sixth-warmest.
Areas downwind of the Great Lakes had some of the greatest snowfall deficits due to a lack of lake-effect snow. Without these robust snow events to bulk up totals, Erie, Pennsylvania, missed out on just over five feet of typical winter snow.
The lack of snow and ice is having a serious impact on small businesses that rely on it to operate, prompting the governors of Michigan and Minnesota to encourage business owners to seek federal assistance through the Small Business Administration.
“From skiing and snowshoeing to winter festivals, snowy winters are part of our way of life in Minnesota,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Waltz said in a news release. “The low precipitation we’ve experienced this winter has had a real economic impact on small businesses that rely on snow and winter tourism to grow and survive.”
Significant snowfall deficits and the unusual warmth are also worsening drought conditions in parts of the Midwest. Severe drought expanded over portions of Wisconsin and Michigan and extreme drought increased in Iowa, according to the latest US Drought Monitor.
The lack of cold air also shattered chances for prolonged, expansive ice coverage across the Great Lakes.
Ice coverage across all five lakes averaged just 5.6% from Jan 1 to March 7, the lowest level since 1973, said James Kessler, a physical scientist at NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab.
“That’s fairly remarkable to say,” Kessler told CNN.
The lakes usually average 29.5% ice cover from January to early March. This year’s deficit means the lakes are missing enough ice to cover an area roughly the size of West Virginia.
The Great Lakes are losing more and more ice as global temperatures rise because of planet-warming emissions. Eight out of the 10 lowest average years for ice coverage have come since 2000, data provided by Kessler showed.

The planet just shattered heat records for the ninth month in a row,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/climate/hottest-february-climate-copernicus-record-intl/index.html,"The planet just shattered heat records for the ninth month in a row
Follow:
Last month was the planet’s hottest February on record, marking the ninth month in a row that global records tumbled, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service.
February was 1.77 degrees Celsius warmer than the average February in pre-industrial times, Copernicus found, and it capped off the hottest 12-month period in recorded history, at 1.56 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
It’s yet another grim climate change milestone, as the long-term impacts of human-caused global warming are given a boost by El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation.
“February joins the long streak of records of the last few months. As remarkable as this might appear, it is not really surprising as the continuous warming of the climate system inevitably leads to new temperature extremes,” Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus, said in a statement.
Even in the context of back-to-back months of unprecedented temperatures, February has been extreme.
Global temperatures in the first half of the month in particular were “exceptionally high,” according to the analysis. Four consecutive days, from February 8 to 11, were 2 degrees warmer than those same days pre-industrial times.
Restricting global heating to well below 2 degrees was a centerpiece of the Paris Agreement that almost every country signed up to in 2015. While scientists are much more concerned with longer-term warming, these temporary breaches are a clear and alarming sign of accelerating heating.
Global ocean temperatures were also off the charts last month, hitting 21.06 degrees — the highest average for any month on record, according to the Copernicus data, beating the previous record of 20.98 degrees set in August 2023.
Experts have expressed shock at just how hot the oceans have been, especially the North Atlantic, which has set a new daily temperature record every day since March 5 last year, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.
“At times, the records have been broken by margins that are virtually statistically impossible,” McNoldy told CNN.
Record ocean heat has significant global impacts. Not only is it dangerous for marine life but it also fuels extreme weather, including scorching heat waves, intense rainfall and ferocious hurricanes.
The Copernicus data “tells a familiar story of warming temperatures and shifting patterns of weather,” said Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK. It is entirely consistent with what scientists have predicted would happen “as greenhouse gases continue to build up in our thin, life-giving atmosphere,” she told CNN.
It provides yet more evidence that the world needs to reduce emissions drastically and immediately, Cloke said.
If this evidence is ignored, Cloke added, “our children’s generation, and all those that follow, will be justified in pointing to the people who lived in 2024 and cursing our reckless stupidity.”

Biden administration will delay a key part of its signature climate policy,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/politics/biden-epa-delay-gas-power-plant-rule-climate/index.html,"Biden administration will delay a key part of its signature climate policy
Follow:
The Biden administration announced Thursday it would delay part of its signature climate plan to slash planet-warming pollution from the power sector.
The Environmental Protection Agency said it would carve existing gas plants out of a proposed regulation to cut emissions from power plants. The EPA will move forward with finalizing rules cutting emissions from existing coal and new natural gas plants this spring, and begin work immediately on a separate rule for existing gas plants.
It is yet another sign of an administration under pressure to dial back its ambitious climate policies as President Joe Biden and swing-state Democrats seek re-election in 2024 while facing Republican attacks on energy costs.
The process to propose and enact new federal regulations is lengthy, and a new rule would not be done in time before the election.
“As EPA works towards final standards to cut climate pollution from existing coal and new gas-fired power plants later this spring, the agency is taking a new, comprehensive approach to cover the entire fleet of natural gas-fired turbines, as well as cover more pollutants including climate, toxic and criteria air pollution,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.
Regan stressed that “this stronger, more durable approach” to starting a separate rulemaking for existing gas plants would “achieve greater emissions reductions than the current proposal,” because it would focus on a wider range of pollutants and air toxins.
The move comes as several environmental justice and climate groups have pressured the EPA to consider a stronger proposal for existing gas plants, complaining in letters to the agency that the proposed rule would have exempted too many facilities.
“We applaud EPA as it moves to finalize urgently needed standards for existing coal plants and new gas plants, and we agree that we must have comprehensive solutions for fossil gas plant pollution,” Abigail Dillen, president of environmental law firm Earthjustice, said in a statement. “This more ambitious strategy will enable EPA to consider technologies that were not considered in its initial proposal and ensure that new standards do not shift pollution to dirty, uncontrolled plants and the communities they pollute.”
Some groups have also been critical of the EPA’s proposed rule because it would require the use of emerging and expensive technologies, which environmental justice groups fear will be built in already marginalized communities.
“We don’t need any false solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture that will add to the pollution burden that already exists in our communities,” said Robert Bullard, director of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at Texas Southern University, and often referred to as the father of the environmental justice movement.
Industry groups, including the trade association for electric utilities, also praised the delay.
“While EEI has not seen the final rules, we appreciate that EPA has acknowledged our concerns with the proposed regulations for existing natural gas,” Emily Fisher, general counsel for Edison Electric Institute, said in a statement.
While some groups applauded the move, others criticized the Biden administration.
“We are extremely disappointed in EPA’s decision to delay finalizing carbon pollution standards for existing gas plants, which make up a significant portion of carbon emissions in the power sector,” Frank Sturges, attorney at the Clean Air Task Force. “Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have gone uncontrolled for far too long, and we have no more time to waste.”
Whether the Biden administration will be able to finish the work it started on its signature power plant rule depends on the results of the election.
CNN and other outlets have also reported the Biden EPA is planning to delay rules that would cut down on pollution from cars and other light-duty vehicles, giving automakers more time to meet the standards."
Severe storm and tornado potential increases as record-breaking warmth fuels threat,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/weather/thunderstorms-midwest-heat-weather-climate/index.html,"Severe storm and tornado potential increases as record-breaking warmth fuels threat
Follow:
Record-breaking warmth will open the door Tuesday for a round of unusual February severe thunderstorms and potential tornadoes in the Midwest as dramatically different air masses clash.
These kinds of storms – which can generate tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds – are possible at any point in the year if the atmospheric conditions are right. But they typically become more frequent starting in the spring – May to July in the same parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes at risk Tuesday – as warmer temperatures take hold.
The risk of severe storms was increased from a Level 2 of 5 to a Level 3 of 5 in these regions by the Storm Prediction Center as confidence grew in a potentially impactful severe storm event.
The storms will rumble to life as a large portion of the US is strapped into a temperature roller coaster with notable rises and falls through the weekend.
Dozens of daily and monthly records were shattered in the central US Monday as temperatures soared to springlike levels. At least 200 more records are in jeopardy through Wednesday over the eastern two-thirds of the US.
The extreme warmth caps what has been one of the warmest winters on record for many from the Midwest to the Northeast and is emblematic of the kind of winters scientists expect more often as global temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change. Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US.
The heat from this week’s event is being steered by a northward bulge in the jet stream – a river of air in the upper atmosphere that acts as a divider between warm and cold – over the central US. It’s allowing warmer, humid air to surge north from the Gulf of Mexico.
The warm, moist air is two of the three ingredients needed to create thunderstorms. A potent cold front associated with a storm tracking into the Midwest will serve as the third ingredient and ignite the severe thunderstorms on Tuesday.
Damaging wind gusts, large hail and a few tornadoes are the main risks associated with severe storms, but Tuesday could also have “a strong tornado or two,” the Storm Prediction Center said. Strong tornadoes are EF2-plus with winds greater than 111 mph.
A Level 3 of 5 risk for severe storms is in place for parts of Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Within this area, far southern Illinois, southern Indiana and parts of northern Kentucky are most at risk for tornadoes.
Other parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes are under a Level 2 of 5 risk for severe storms. Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Indianapolis could all face damaging thunderstorms.
Disruptive thunderstorms look to hold off until the evening across southern Michigan, allowing many voters to stay dry at the polls for the Presidential primary Tuesday.
Chicago’s greatest risk for strong thunderstorms and possible tornadoes will occur Tuesday evening.
The risk for severe thunderstorms will decrease by Wednesday as the storm spreads into the East. Rain with a few embedded thunderstorms could soak much of the East Wednesday while temperatures plummet over the central US in the cold front’s wake.
Topsy-turvy temperatures
Temperature records were shattered in the central US Monday as the thermometer reached triple digits for the first time this year.
Dallas sizzled as the high topped out at 94 degrees: smashing the daily record and falling just shy of the all-time February high. Killeen, Texas, reached 100 degrees.
Minneapolis recorded its warmest-ever February day. Chicago smashed its daily high temperature record as it climbed to 71 degrees.
The extreme heat spreads east on Tuesday. High temperatures climb 20 to 30 degrees above average from the southern Plains through the Great Lakes. Additional monthly records could be in jeopardy, especially in the Midwest and Great Lakes.
High temperatures come crashing right back down for much of the region Wednesday.
Temperatures could drop 30 to 40 degrees in just 24 hours in the central US.
The cold will arrive so abruptly that Tuesday’s stormy weather may end as a bit of wintry mix or snow early Wednesday morning in Chicago.
Chicago is forecast to reach the 70s again on Tuesday before plummeting to a high in the 20s Wednesday.
Low temperatures in Minneapolis are forecast to plunge into the single digits by early Wednesday morning.
Wednesday will likely be the warmest day of the week for the East Coast before the potent cold front arrives and topples temperatures Thursday.
And the weather whiplash won’t stop. The blast of chill will be short-lived as temperatures in the central US climb close to springlike levels again by Friday and much of the East by Saturday.
Above-average warmth is likely to persist through early March over the eastern half of the US, according to the Climate Prediction Center."
The ‘Doomsday Glacier’ is rapidly melting. Scientists now have evidence for when it started and why,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/climate/doomsday-glacier-antarctic-ice-melt-climate-intl/index.html,"The ‘Doomsday Glacier’ is rapidly melting. Scientists now have evidence for when it started and why
Follow:
Scientists have looked back in time to reconstruct the past life of Antarctica’s “Doomsday Glacier” — nicknamed because its collapse could cause catastrophic sea level rise. They have discovered it started retreating rapidly in the 1940s, according to a new study that provides an alarming insight into future melting.
The Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica is the world’s widest and roughly the size of Florida. Scientists knew it had been losing ice at an accelerating rate since the 1970s, but because satellite data only goes back a few decades, they didn’t know exactly when significant melting began.
Now there is an answer to this question, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
By analyzing marine sediment cores extracted from beneath the ocean floor, researchers found the glacier began to significantly retreat in the 1940s, likely kicked off by a very strong El Niño event — a natural climate fluctuation which tends to have a warming impact.
Since then, the glacier has been unable to recover, which may reflect the increasing impact of human-caused global warming, according to the report.
What happens to Thwaites will have global reverberations. The glacier already contributes 4% of sea level rise as it sheds billions of tons of ice a year into the ocean. Its complete collapse could raise sea levels by more than 2 feet.
But it also plays a vital role in the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, acting like a cork holding back the vast stretch of ice behind it. Thwaites’ collapse would undermine the stability of the ice sheet, which holds enough water to raise sea levels by at least 10 feet, causing catastrophic global flooding.
The study’s findings match previous research on the neighboring Pine Island Glacier, one of the largest ice streams in Antarctica, which scientists also found started retreating rapidly in the 1940s.
This makes the research significant, said Julia Wellner, an associate professor of geology at the University of Houston and one of the study’s authors. What’s happening to Thwaites is not specific to one glacier, but part of the bigger context of a changing climate, she told CNN.
“If both glaciers are retreating at the same time, that’s further evidence that they’re actually being forced by something,” Wellner said.
To build a picture of Thwaites’ life over the past nearly 12,000 years, the scientists took an icebreaker vessel up close to the edge of the glacier to collect ocean sediment cores from a range of depths.
These cores provide a historical timeline. Each layer yields information about the ocean and ice going back thousands of years. By scanning and dating the sediments, the scientists were able to pinpoint when the substantial melting began.
From this information, they believe Thwaites’ retreat was set off by an extreme El Niño that happened at a time when the glacier was likely already in a phase of melting, knocking it off balance. “It’s sort of like if you get kicked when you’re already sick, it’s going to have a much bigger impact,” Wellner said.
The findings are alarming because they suggest that once big changes are triggered, it’s very hard to stop them, said James Smith, a marine geologist at the British Antarctic Survey and a study co-author.
“Once an ice sheet retreat is set in motion it can continue for decades, even if what started it gets no worse,” he told CNN.
While similar retreats have happened much further back in the past, the ice sheet recovered and regrew, Smith said. But these glaciers “show no signs of recovery, which likely reflects the growing influence of human-caused climate change.”
Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the research, said the study confirms and adds detail to our understanding of how Thwaites’ retreat began.
A system that was already close to being unstable “took a big shot from a mostly natural event,” said Scambos, referring to the El Niño. “Further events arising more from the warming climate trend took things further, and started the widespread retreat we’re seeing today,” he told CNN.
Martin Truffer, a physics professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said the research shows if a glacier is in a sensitive state, “a single event can knock it into a retreat from which it is difficult to recover.”
“Humans are changing the climate and this study shows that small continuous changes in climate can lead to step changes in glacier state,” said Truffer, who was not involved in the research.
Antarctica is sometimes called the “sleeping giant,” because scientists are still trying to understand how vulnerable this icy, isolated continent may be as humans heat up the atmosphere and oceans.
Wellner is a geologist — she focuses on the past not the future — but she said this study gives important and alarming context for what might happen to the ice in this vital stretch of Antarctica.
It shows that even if a trigger for rapid melting has ended, that doesn’t mean the response stops. “So if the ice is already in retreat today,” she said, “just because we might stop warming, it might not stop its retreat.”"
One of the world’s biggest cities may be just months away from running out of water,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/25/climate/mexico-city-water-crisis-climate-intl/index.html,"One of the world’s biggest cities may be just months away from running out of water
Alejandro Gomez has been without proper running water for more than three months. Sometimes it comes on for an hour or two, but only a small trickle, barely enough to fill a couple of buckets. Then nothing for many days.
Gomez, who lives in Mexico City’s Tlalpan district, doesn’t have a big storage tank so can’t get water truck deliveries — there’s simply nowhere to store it. Instead, he and his family eke out what they can buy and store.
When they wash themselves, they capture the runoff to flush the toilet. It’s hard, he told CNN. “We need water, it’s essential for everything.”
Water shortages are not uncommon in this neighborhood, but this time feels different, Gomez said. “Right now, we are getting this hot weather. It’s even worse, things are more complicated.”
Mexico City, a sprawling metropolis of nearly 22 million people and one of the world’s biggest cities, is facing a severe water crisis as a tangle of problems — including geography, chaotic urban development and leaky infrastructure — are compounded by the impacts of climate change.
Years of abnormally low rainfall, longer dry periods and high temperatures have added stress to a water system already straining to cope with increased demand. Authorities have been forced to introduce significant restrictions on the water pumped from reservoirs.
“Several neighborhoods have suffered from a lack of water for weeks, and there are still four months left for the rains to start,” said Christian Domínguez Sarmiento, an atmospheric scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
Politicians are downplaying any sense of crisis, but some experts say the situation has now reached such critical levels that Mexico City could be barreling towards “day zero” in a matter of months — where the taps run dry for huge swaths of the city.
Historic lows
Densely populated Mexico City stretches out across a high-altitude lake bed, around 7,300 feet above sea level. It was built on clay-rich soil — into which it is now sinking — and is prone to earthquakes and highly vulnerable to climate change. It’s perhaps one of the last places anyone would choose to build a megacity today.
The Aztecs chose this spot to build their city of Tenochtitlan in 1325, when it was a series of lakes. They built on an island, expanding the city outwards, constructing networks of canals and bridges to work with the water.
But when the Spanish arrived in the early 16th century, they tore down much of the city, drained the lakebed, filled in canals and ripped out forests. They saw “water as an enemy to overcome for the city to thrive,” said Jose Alfredo Ramirez, an architect and co-director of Groundlab, a design and policy research organization.
Their decision paved the way for many of Mexico City’s modern problems. Wetlands and rivers have been replaced with concrete and asphalt. In the rainy season, it floods. In the dry season, it’s parched.
Around 60% of Mexico City’s water comes from its underground aquifer, but this has been so over-extracted that the city is sinking at a frightening rate — around 20 inches a year, according to recent research. And the aquifer is not being replenished anywhere near fast enough. The rainwater rolls off the city’s hard, impermeable surfaces, rather than sinking into the ground.
The rest of the city’s water is pumped vast distances uphill from sources outside the city, in an incredibly inefficient process, during which around 40% of the water is lost through leaks.
The Cutzamala water system, a network of reservoirs, pumping stations, canals and tunnels, supplies about 25% of the water used by the Valley of Mexico, which includes Mexico City. But severe drought has taken its toll. Currently, at around 39% of capacity, it’s been languishing at a historic low.
“It’s almost half of the amount of water that we should have,” said Fabiola Sosa-Rodríguez, head of economic growth and environment at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City.
In October, Conagua, the country’s national water commission, announced it would restrict water from Cutzamala by 8% “to ensure the supply of drinking water to the population given the severe drought.”
Just a few weeks later, officials significantly tightened restrictions, reducing the water supplied by the system by nearly 25%, blaming extreme weather conditions.
“Measures will have to be taken to be able to distribute the water that Cutzamala has over time, to ensure that it does not run out,” Germán Arturo Martínez Santoyo, the director general of Conagua, said in a statement at the time.
Around 60% of Mexico is experiencing moderate to exceptional drought, according to a February report. Nearly 90% of Mexico City is in severe drought — and it’s set to get worse with the start of the rainy season still months away.
“We are around the middle of the dry season with sustained temperature increases expected until April or May,” said June Garcia-Becerra, an assistant professor in engineering at the University of Northern British Columbia.
Natural climate variability heavily affects this part of Mexico. Three years of La Niña brought drought to the region, and then the arrival of El Niño last year helped deliver a painfully short rainy season that failed to replenish the reservoirs.
But the long-term trend of human-caused global warming hums in the background, fueling longer droughts and fiercer heat waves, as well as heavier rains when they do arrive.
“Climate change has made droughts increasingly severe due to the lack of water,” said UNAM’s Sarmiento. Added to this, high temperatures “have caused the water that is available in the Cutzamala system to evaporate,” she said.
Last summer saw brutal heat waves roil large parts of the country, which claimed at least 200 lives. These heat waves would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, according to an analysis by scientists.
The climate impacts have collided with the growing pains of a fast-expanding city. As the population booms, experts say the centralized water system has not kept pace.
‘Day zero?’
The crisis has set up a fierce debate about whether the city will reach a “day zero,” where the Cutzamala system falls to such low levels that it will be unable to provide any water to the city’s residents.
Local media widely reported in early February that an official from a branch of Conagua said that without significant rain, “day zero” could arrive as early as June 26.
But authorities have since sought to assure residents there will be no day zero. In a press conference on February 14, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that work was underway to address the water problems. Mexico City’s mayor, Martí Batres Guadarrama, said in a recent press conference that reports of day zero were “fake news” spread by political opponents.
Conagua declined CNN’s interview requests and did not answer specific questions on the prospect of a day zero.
But many experts warn of a spiraling crisis. Mexico City could run out of water before the rainy season arrives if it carries on using it in the same way, Sosa-Rodríguez said. “It’s probable that we will face a day zero,” she added.
This doesn’t mean a complete collapse of the water system, she said, because the city isn’t dependent on just one source. It won’t be the same as when Cape Town in South Africa came perilously close to running totally dry in 2018 following a severe multi-year drought. “Some groups will still have water,” she said, “but most of the people won’t.”
Raúl Rodríguez Márquez, president of the non-profit Water Advisory Council, said he doesn’t believe the city will reach a day zero this year — but, he warned, it will if changes are not made.
“We are in a critical situation, and we could reach an extreme situation in the next few months,” he told CNN.
‘I don’t think anyone is prepared’
For nearly a decade, Sosa-Rodríguez said she has been warning officials of the danger of a day zero for Mexico City.
She said the solutions are clear: Better wastewater treatment would both increase water availability and decrease pollution, while rainwater harvesting systems could capture and treat the rain, and allow residents to reduce their reliance on the water network or water trucks by 30%.
Fixing leaks would make the system much more efficient and reduce the volume of water that has to be extracted from the aquifer. And nature-based solutions, such as restoring rivers and wetlands, would help provide and purify water, she said, with the added advantage of greening and cooling the city.
In a statement on its website, Conagua said it is undertaking a 3-year project to install, develop and improve water infrastructure to help the city cope with decreases in the Cutzamala system, including adding new wells and commissioning water treatment plants.
But in the meantime, tensions are rising as some residents are forced to cope with shortages, while others — often in the wealthier enclaves — remain mostly unaffected.
“There is a clear unequal access to water in the city and this is related to people’s income,” Sosa-Rodríguez said. While day zero might not be here yet for the whole of Mexico City, some neighborhoods have been grappling with it for years, she added.
Amanda Martínez, another resident of the city’s Tlalpan district, said for people here, water shortages are nothing new. She and her family often have to pay more than $100 for a tank of water from one of the city’s water trucks. But it’s getting worse. Sometimes more than two weeks can go by without water and she fears what may be coming, she told CNN.
“I don’t think anyone is prepared.”

This may be the final nail in the coffin for a winter like no other,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/23/weather/warm-weather-winter-climate/index.html,"This may be the final nail in the coffin for a winter like no other
Follow:
An already fledgling winter is on borrowed time for much of the country as a dramatic pattern change next week and temperature forecasts into March signal what could be the final nail in the coffin of a winter like no other.
Unseasonable warmth, missing snow and disappearing ice have blurred the line between winter and spring for a large portion of the US. Nowhere has this been more the case than in the central and eastern US. Despite a brief but significant outbreak of Arctic air in mid-January and a few chilly days last week, mild conditions have been the norm.
The warmth is about to ratchet up a notch next week. An area stretching from Dallas north to Minneapolis and east to Philadelphia will soar to levels more akin to May or June than the end of February.
More than 200 daily temperature records could be tied or broken as daytime highs climb and overnight lows fail to cool off.
The significant warming trend kicks off Sunday in the central US and become more intense by Monday. A northward shift in the jet stream will allow very warm air to rush north from the Gulf of Mexico and reach the Canadian border.
Monday will likely be the warmest day of the year so far for cities including St. Louis, Dallas and Chicago. That will also notably be the case in typically-cold parts of the central US. High temperatures there could be as much as 30 degrees above normal.
Omaha, Nebraska, is forecast to climb into the 70s on Monday. The city should normally top out around 40 degrees at the end of February and typically doesn’t record its first 70 degree temperature until late March.
Dallas may flirt with the 90-degree mark on Monday – a threshold that isn’t typically eclipsed until late April. Triple-digit temperatures are possible for parts of Texas near the Mexico border.
The core of the unseasonable warmth spreads east on Tuesday to encompass much of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. High temperatures in the 60s are likely from Chicago to Cleveland, while St. Louis could approach 80 degrees.
And there won’t be any relief for Texas with highs in the 80s and 90s likely.
Warmth reaches the East Coast by Wednesday. Philadelphia and New York City could top out in the 60s. The Gulf Coast and the Southeast will continue to sizzle.
With spring-like warmth comes spring-like weather. A storm forecast to develop near the Great Lakes late Tuesday could unload rain and thunderstorms on much of the East into Thursday.
The clash of warm, moist air with the storm’s potent cold front could set the stage in parts of the Plains and Midwest for some severe thunderstorms late Tuesday. The same threat could carry on east into parts of the Southeast and Ohio Valley Wednesday.
A quick flip back to a more-seasonable chill is likely in the north-central US Tuesday and Wednesday behind the cold front. But the brief burst of cold is likely too little too late to resurrect a largely nonexistent winter, which officially ends in March.
This winter is on pace to become one of the warmest on record in dozens of US cities, with the highest concentration in the Midwest and Northeast.
Warmth and winter weather do not get along. Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US and snowfall is declining around the globe as temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change.
Across the Midwest and Great Lakes, snowfall is a few feet below what’s normal by this point. Over a foot and a half of snow is still missing for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, despite finally recording a few inches of snow earlier this month. Snowfall deficits are extreme downwind of the Great Lakes where Syracuse, New York, and Erie, Pennsylvania, are each missing nearly 5 feet of snow.
Ice is also almost nowhere to be found on the Great Lakes. Close to 40% of the Great Lakes are typically covered in ice by late February, but total ice coverage was near a record-low 6% Thursday.
There’s more bad news for snow and ice chances – the warmth is sticking around.
Temperatures across the eastern two-thirds of the US are forecast to remain above average through at least early March. The northern tier of the US will also likely remain unseasonably warm beyond then, through much of March, according to the Climate Prediction Center."
It’s already hurricane season in the waters of the Atlantic. That could spell danger with La Niña coming,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/weather/la-nina-hurricane-season-climate/index.html,"It’s already hurricane season in the waters of the Atlantic. That could spell danger with La Niña coming

Hurricane season is months away, but the waters where hurricanes roam haven’t received the memo. Ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic are historically warm for this early in the year, raising the risk of a hyperactive storm season that could also be supercharged by a budding La Niña.
“This season should be full speed ahead, as there are no factors going against an active season,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research scientist at the University of Miami, told CNN. “We’ll likely have an anomalously warm ocean and neutral or La Niña conditions for the peak of hurricane season – all the things you don’t want if you want less Atlantic storms.”
Stronger ones, too. Warm water provides the necessary fuel not just to help storms form, but to also boost their strength.
Sea surface temperatures across the North Atlantic Ocean reached a level unheard of for February earlier this month: 1 degree Celsius above what’s typical, and more akin to June than February. They were even higher in the part where most Atlantic hurricanes form, reaching July-like levels from West Africa to Central America.
It’s a continuation of record-smashing global ocean heat that started last March and hasn’t stopped since – driven by a super El Niño and global temperature rise from human-caused climate change, McNoldy said.
“(The heat) was so far above anything ever observed that it seemed impossible it would happen,” McNoldy said.
But it did. And ocean temperatures this year are off to an even warmer start than last year, including in the Atlantic, which could set the stage for a dangerous hurricane season.
“It’s February and a lot can still change. But if it doesn’t, then it could potentially be a very busy season,” said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University.
North Atlantic temperatures typically only go up from here, climbing in spring and reaching a maximum in early fall when hurricane season also peaks. And they are “almost certainly” going to continue to be warmer-than-normal into the summer, McNoldy said.
That forecast becomes even more alarming when paired with the likelihood of a La Niña – an ocean and weather pattern over the tropical Pacific that has a tendency to amplify Atlantic hurricane season.
Tropical systems need several atmospheric factors to come together to form, but one of the most important is low levels of wind shear – upper level winds that, if strong, can rip storms apart or even keep them from forming in the first place. Wind shear in the Atlantic typically decreases during La Niña, making it easier for more storms to form, strengthen and potentially impact land.
La Niña’s timing matters, since the resulting changes in the atmosphere will not be instantaneous, according to Klotzbach.
It takes time for La Niña’s influence to percolate to the Atlantic. The earlier La Niña arrives, the sooner it would influence hurricane season.
“If you don’t want an active hurricane season, you would need La Niña to wait as long as possible to begin,” McNoldy said.
Forecasters with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center believe La Niña could arrive as soon as summer, but more likely by fall.
It’s difficult to know what the combination of near-record ocean warmth and a La Niña could be capable of, since there has been no other hurricane season in which temperatures were this extreme, Klotzbach said.
The 2010 and 2005 seasons were two of the most active and included notorious storms like like Katrina, Rita and Irene. Both had neutral or La Niña conditions in place, “but (similar outcomes aren’t) a guarantee since the anomalies now are very much warmer than any other year in recent record,” Klotzbach said.
Last year’s very active season also had no perfect analog. It was under the influence of El Niño, which should have suppressed storm activity, but was partly neutralized by the record-warm Atlantic. Twenty storms formed – the fourth-most on record.
Even if the season starts without any of La Niña’s influence, abnormally warm waters could still mean we see storms develop quite early in the season, a concern echoed by both McNoldy and Klotzbach.
But an active season isn’t necessarily the same as an impactful season. Many of last year’s storms didn’t hit land or populated areas, but having more storms increases the chances of a high-impact landfall.
“The more darts you throw at a dartboard, the more likely some are to stick. So, when more storms develop, it becomes more likely some will make landfall,” Klotzbach explained.
It’s simply too soon to know with confidence that this season will be impactful, as “day-to-day weather patterns” steer storms toward or away from land, Klotzbach said.
However the upcoming season shakes out, McNoldy urged anyone located in hurricane-prone regions to do two important things.
“Pay close attention to each storm that develops and don’t get complacent.”"
"The Amazon has survived changes in the climate for 65 million years. Now it’s heading for collapse, a study says",https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/climate/amazon-rainforest-climate-deforestation-collapse-int/index.html,"The Amazon has survived changes in the climate for 65 million years. Now it’s heading for collapse, a study says
Follow:
The Amazon rainforest is on course to reach a crucial tipping point as soon as 2050, with devastating consequences for the region and the world’s ability to tackle climate change, according to a study published Wednesday.
The Amazon has proven resilient to natural changes in the climate for 65 million years, but deforestation and the human-caused climate crisis have brought new levels of stress and could cause a large-scale collapse of the forest system within the next three decades, the study said.
The researchers predict that 10% to 47% of the Amazon will be exposed to stresses that could push the ecosystem to its tipping point, a critical threshold that once crossed will lead to a downward spiral of impacts.
The study, led by researchers at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil and published in the journal Nature, takes a holistic approach to estimating how soon the Amazon could reach that threshold.
The study’s authors looked at the impact of warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires to draw their conclusions.
“We already knew about all these factors at play, but once we connected the pieces of this complex puzzle, the image was alarming,” Bernardo Flores, lead author of the study, told CNN. “Our findings revealed how the Amazon forest system could enter a phase of self-reinforced collapse sooner than previously thought.”
Previous studies had not predicted a collapse of this scale could happen in the 21st century.
A collapse of the Amazon, the world’s vastest tropical rainforest, would weaken its ability to absorb planet-warming carbon pollution from the atmosphere, which would exacerbate global warming. Once known as the lungs of the planet, the Amazon has already become a net emitter of carbon emissions, meaning it releases more carbon into the atmosphere now than it absorbs. Forest fires and logging are the main reasons for that change.
But the forest is still a huge, crucial carbon sink. It holds the equivalent of 15 to 20 years of the entire world’s global carbon stores.
A loss of ‘flying rivers’
The study also shows how a deteriorating Amazon could impact forests in other parts of South America.
The Amazon is crucial for water supply across the region, the study said, contributing as much as half of its rainfall through what the authors call “flying rivers” – rain that originates over the Amazon and spreads to other parts of the region. That means other forests and ecosystems that rely on rain are able to thrive. Those places include the Pantanal wetlands — the world’s largest tropical wetlands that cross Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay — and the La Plata River basin, a biodiverse and crucial water system that drains one-fifth of South American land.
The Amazon provides moisture beyond the region, too.
“The Amazon forest is a major pump of moisture into the atmosphere, contributing to circulation processes that transfer moisture across the globe,” Flores said. “When the forest is reduced, this weakens this process, causing the global climate to find a new equilibrium.”
The authors of the study noted that water stress was a common factor in the disturbances to the Amazon. Water stress occurs when there is not enough water to meet human or ecological needs.
Global warming is intensifying the effects of water stress by causing the Amazonian climate to become drier and warmer. This increases water stress on trees, particularly those with low drought resistance in northwest parts of the forest, which “could suffer massive mortality if suddenly exposed to severe water stress,” according to the study.
Reaching its tipping point could also make parts of the Amazon uninhabitable due to unbearable heat and a lack of resources for indigenous peoples and local communities, the study shows.
“A war of attrition on the Amazon rainforest is being waged through human-caused climate change and deforestation, which is sending this irreplaceable jewel of the planet to the brink,” said Richard Allan, a professor in Climate Science at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study. “These critical effects … are compounded by continued destruction of forest for agriculture, settlement, and industry.”
The study recommends ending deforestation, promoting forest restoration, and expanding protected areas and Indigenous territories. Flores also stressed the need for global cooperation to cut greenhouse gas emissions and emphasized the importance of Amazonian countries cooperating to promote forest restoration."
Greenland is getting greener. That could have huge consequences for the world,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/climate/greenland-ice-loss-vegetation-climate-intl/index.html,"Greenland is getting greener. That could have huge consequences for the world
Follow:
The area of Greenland’s ice loss in the past three decades is roughly 36 times the size of New York City — land that is rapidly giving way to wetlands and shrubs, a study published Tuesday shows.
The amount of vegetation in Greenland doubled between the mid-1980s and mid-2010s, as swaths of the country that were once covered in ice and snow were transformed into barren rock, wetlands or shrub area. Wetlands alone quadrupled in that time.
By analyzing satellite imagery, the scientists found that Greenland had lost 28,707 square-kilometers (around 11,000 square-miles) of ice in the three-decade period, and warned of a cascade of impacts that could have serious consequences for climate change and sea level rise.
Warmer air temperatures have driven ice loss, which has in turn raised land temperatures. That has caused the melting of permafrost, a frozen layer just beneath the Earth’s surface and found in much of the Arctic, and that melt releases planet-warming carbon dioxide and methane, contributing to more global warming. Permafrost melt is also causing land instability, which could impact infrastructure and buildings.
“We have seen signs that the loss of ice is triggering other reactions which will result in further loss of ice and further ‘greening’ of Greenland, where shrinking ice exposes bare rock that is then colonized by tundra and eventually shrub,” one of the report’s authors, Jonathan Carrivick, said in a press release. “At the same time, water released from the melting ice is moving sediment and silt, and that eventually forms wetlands and fenlands.”
The loss of ice is creating what’s known as a feedback loop. Snow and ice typically reflect the sun’s energy back into space, preventing excessive heating in parts of the Earth. But as ice disappears, those areas absorb more solar energy, raising land surface temperatures, which can cause further melt and other negative impacts.
Ice melt also increases the amount of water in lakes, where water absorbs more heat than snow, which increases land surface temperatures.
Greenland has been warming at twice the global mean rate since the 1970s, and the study’s authors warn that more extreme temperatures in the future are likely.
Greenland is the world’s biggest island and is mostly covered by ice and glaciers. Around 57,000 people live in the country, which is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. Much of the population is indigenous and many people there rely on natural ecosystems for their survival.
Michael Grimes, the report’s lead author, said that the flow of sediments and nutrients into coastal waters was particularly problematic for indigenous communities that rely on fishing, as well as for hunters on other parts of the island.
“These changes are critical, particularly for the indigenous populations whose traditional subsistence hunting practices rely on the stability of these delicate ecosystems,” he said.
“Moreover, the loss of ice mass in Greenland is a substantial contributor to global sea level rise, a trend that poses significant challenges both now and in the future.”"

Winter has gone missing across the Midwest and Great Lakes, and time is running out to find it. Dozens of cities are on track for one of the warmest winters on record, making snow and ice rare commodities.
Several cities are missing feet of snow compared to a typical winter, ice on the Great Lakes is near record-low levels and the springlike temperatures have even spawned rare wintertime severe thunderstorms.
A classic El Niño pattern coupled with the effects of a warming climate are to blame for this “non-winter” winter, said Pete Boulay, a climatologist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US and snowfall is declining around the globe as temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change.
Minnesota is the epicenter of some of the season’s most unusual heat and missing snow.
“There have been past winters where we’ve had a week or two like this, maybe even a couple of weeks,” Boulay told CNN, describing the odd nature of this winter in Minnesota, before noting it hasn’t ever been this warm for this long.
“I’ve never experienced anything like it,” Boulay said. “I hooked up the hose, which is something we wouldn’t do in Minnesota during the winter, and washed my cars this past weekend.”
The state had its warmest-ever December and a toasty January despite some brief, brutal cold. The 10 days of bone-chilling cold in early January were the only ones that truly felt like winter this season, according to Boulay.
Abnormal warmth continued into February in Minnesota as temperatures the first week of the month paced between 18 and 23 degrees above average, sending people outdoors into the springlike weather.
It’s not just Minnesota: Dozens of cities from the Midwest to the Northeast are about to log one of the warmest winters on record into the history books.
Springlike warmth even opened up the door for springlike severe weather. Damaging thunderstorms rolled across Wisconsin on Thursday night and produced the state’s first February tornado.
Warmth and snow do not get along, which is evident when looking at snowfall deficits in Minnesota and the Midwest at large.
The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport has recorded only 4.1 inches of snow since December 1 – a deficit nearly two feet deep. Snow there has been so paltry this winter, that even Nashville – 700 miles to the southeast of the Twin Cities – has had more.
The absence of snow and cold is a huge blow to the tourism industry across Minnesota, according to Boulay. Winter recreation mainstays like snowmobiling, ice fishing, skiing and snowshoeing are all hurting.
Missing snowfall is even more pronounced in areas surrounding the Great Lakes, especially those that are typically buried by lake-effect snow. Erie, Pennsylvania, is missing around four feet this winter.
Ice has performed a disappearing act on the Great Lakes.
“We’re teetering on the edge of record low ice coverage,” Melissa Widhalm, the associate director of the Midwestern Regional Climate Center at Purdue University, told CNN.
About 36% of the Great Lakes should be covered in ice in early February, but as of Friday, total ice coverage hovered near a record low 5%, NOAA data shows.
The Great Lakes have experienced a decline in both overall coverage and longevity of ice in the past 50 years as warmer winters increase the likelihood of ice-free lakes, according to Climate Central, a nonprofit climate research group.
The lackluster ice coverage is part of a larger troubling trend across the Great Lakes. Overall maximum ice extent has dropped 25% in the last 50 years, according to Climate Central.
Robust, extensive ice is crucial for the region’s winter recreation economy. Without the ice, shorelines are left vulnerable to damaging waves and cities downwind of the lakes are at risk of prolific lake-effect snow if cold air actually arrives.
There are still a few weeks left for snow, cold and ice to make a comeback, but with more than half of winter in the rearview, an exceptional season has already made its mark.
“This winter is really going to stand out,” Boulay said."

Follow:
A crucial system of ocean currents may already be on course to collapse, according to a new report, with alarming implications for sea level rise and global weather — leading temperatures to plunge dramatically in some regions and rise in others.
Using exceptionally complex and expensive computing systems, scientists found a new way to detect an early warning signal for the collapse of these currents, according to the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction.
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC) — of which the Gulf Stream is part — works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward.
The currents carry heat and nutrients to different areas of the globe and play a vital role in keeping the climate of large parts of the Northern Hemisphere relatively mild.
For decades, scientists have been sounding the alarm on the circulation’s stability as climate change warms the ocean and melts ice, disrupting the balance of heat and salt that determines the currents’ strength.
While many scientists believe the AMOC will slow under climate change, and could even grind to a halt, there remains huge uncertainty over when and how fast this could happen. The AMOC has only been monitored continuously since 2004.
Scientists do know — from building a picture of the past using things like ice cores and ocean sediments — the AMOC shut down more than 12,000 years ago following rapid glacier melt.
Now they are scrambling to work out if it could happen again.
This new study provides an “important breakthrough,” said René van Westen, a marine and atmospheric researcher at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and study co-author.
The scientists used a supercomputer to run complex climate models over a period of three months, simulating a gradual increase of freshwater to the AMOC — representing ice melt as well as rainfall and river runoff, which can dilute the ocean’s salinity and weaken the currents.
As they slowly increased the freshwater in the model, they saw the AMOC gradually weaken until it abruptly collapsed. It’s the first time a collapse has been detectable using these complex models, representing “bad news for the climate system and humanity,” the report says.
What the study doesn’t do, however, is give timeframes for a potential collapse. More research is needed, van Westen told CNN, including models which also mimic climate change impacts, such as increasing levels of planet-heating pollution, which this study did not.
“But we can at least say that we are heading in the direction of the tipping point under climate change,” van Westen said.
The impacts of the AMOC’s collapse could be catastrophic. Some parts of Europe might see temperatures plunge by up to 30 degrees Celsius over a century, the study finds, leading to a completely different climate over the course of just a decade or two.
“No realistic adaptation measures can deal with such rapid temperature changes,” the study authors write.
Countries in the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, could see increased warming, while the Amazon’s wet and dry seasons could flip, causing serious disruption to the ecosystem.
The AMOC’s collapse could also cause sea levels to surge by around 1 meter (3.3 feet), van Westen said.
Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer at Potsdam University in Germany, who was not involved with the study, said it was “a major advance in AMOC stability science.”
“It confirms that the AMOC has a tipping point beyond which it breaks down if the Northern Atlantic Ocean is diluted with freshwater,” he told CNN.
Previous studies finding the AMOC’s tipping point used much simpler models, he said, giving hope to some scientists that it might not be found under more complex models.
This study crushes those hopes, Rahmstorf said.
Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, said the study was the first to use complex climate models to show the AMOC can flip from “on” to “off” in response to relatively small amounts of freshwater entering the ocean.
But there are reasons to be cautious, he added. Even though the study used a complex model, it still has a low resolution, he said, meaning there could be limitations in representing some parts of the currents.
This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the AMOC may be approaching a tipping point — and that it could even be close.
A 2021 study found that the AMOC was weaker than any other time in the past 1,000 years. And a particularly alarming — and somewhat controversial — report published in July last year, concluded that the AMOC could be on course to collapse potentially as early as 2025.
Yet huge uncertainties remain. Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, said he suspected the theory of a potentially imminent shutdown of the AMOC “will remain somewhat controversial until, one year, we know that it is happening.”
He likened its potential collapse to the “wild gyrations of a stock market that precede a major crash” — it’s nearly impossible to unpick which changes are reversible, and which are a precursor to a disaster.
Modern data shows the AMOC’s strength fluctuates, but there is no observed evidence yet of a decline, Hirschi said. “Whether abrupt changes in the AMOC similar to those seen in the past will occur as our climate continues to warm is an important open question.”
This study is a piece of that puzzle, Rahmstorf said. “(It) adds significantly to the rising concern about an AMOC collapse in the not too distant future,” he said. “We will ignore this risk at our peril.”"

Evidence from a 2,000-foot-long ice core reveals that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet shrank suddenly and dramatically around 8,000 years ago, according to new research — providing an alarming insight into how quickly Antarctic ice could melt and send sea levels soaring.
Part of the ice sheet thinned by 450 meters (1,476 feet) — a height greater than the Empire State Building — over a period of just 200 years at the end of the last Ice Age, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Geoscience.
It’s the first direct evidence that shows such a rapid loss of ice anywhere in Antarctica, according to the study’s authors.
While scientists knew the ice sheet was bigger at the end of the last Ice Age than today, much less was known about when exactly that shrinking happened, said Eric Wolff, a glaciologist at the University of Cambridge in the UK and a study author.
This study changes that, he told CNN. “We’ve been able to say exactly when it retreated, but we’ve also been able to say how fast it retreated.”
Now it’s clear the ice sheet retreated and thinned very rapidly in the past, Wolff said, the danger is that it could begin again. “If it does start to retreat, it really will do it very fast,” he added.
That could have catastrophic consequences for global sea level rise. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise sea levels by about 5 meters – more than 16 feet — which would cause devastating flooding in coastal towns and cities around the world.
The study is “an excellent piece of detective work” about a major part of the Antarctic ice sheet, said Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder.
The key message is “the amount of ice stored in Antarctica can change very quickly — at a pace that would be hard to deal with for many coastal cities,” he told CNN.
Ice cores are historical archives of the Earth’s atmosphere. Made up of layers of ice that formed as snow fell and compacted over thousands of years, they contain bubbles of ancient air as well as contaminants that provide a record of environmental changes over millennia.
The ice core analyzed in the study was drilled from Skytrain Ice Rise located at the edge of the ice sheet, near the point where the ice starts to float and become part of the Ronne Ice Shelf.
Scientists extracted it in 2019, in a painstaking process that involved drilling constantly for 40 days, pulling up a thin cylinder of ice a few feet at a time. They then cut the core into sections, packed them in insulated boxes kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius, and sent them to the UK via plane then ship.
Once in the UK, the scientists measured the ice core’s water isotopes, which provide information on temperature in the past. Warmer temperatures indicate lower-lying ice — think of it like a mountain, Wolff said, the higher up you go the colder it gets.
They also measured the pressure of trapped air bubbles in the ice. Lower-lying and thinner ice contains higher pressure air bubbles.
It was a surprise when the data revealed just how quickly the ice had thinned at the end of the last Ice Age, Wolff said. “We actually spent a lot of time checking that we hadn’t made a mistake with the analysis.”
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is particularly vulnerable to climate change, because the land under it is below sea level and slopes downward. When warm water gets underneath, it can melt very fast. “It can have a runaway process, and that’s evidently what happened 8,000 years ago,” Wolff said.
What makes the findings so alarming, said Isobel Rowell, an ice core scientist at the British Antarctic Survey and a study co-author, is that once that runaway happens “there’s really very little, if anything, that we can do to stop it,” she told CNN.
The crucial thing “is not to test it too far,” Wolff said, and that means tackling climate change. “We can avoid these tipping points still,” he said.
The new data will help improve the accuracy of the models scientists use to predict how the ice sheet will respond to future global heating, the report says.
David Thornalley, an ocean and climate scientist at University College London, said the study’s data was “striking.” He cautioned that as the study looked at a period 8,000 years ago, when climate conditions were different, the results aren’t a direct example of what could happen today. But, he added, they are still able to offer an “insight into the way that ice sheets can collapse.”
The study comes as scientists continue to sound the alarm about what is happening to the Earth’s most isolated continent.
For example, the Thwaites Glacier, also in West Antarctica, is melting rapidly. A 2022 study said the Thwaites — dubbed the Doomsday Glacier for the catastrophic impact its collapse would have on sea level rise — was hanging on “by its fingernails” as the planet warms.
This new study adds to these concerns, Scambos said. “(It) shows that the very same processes we are seeing just beginning now, in areas like Thwaites Glacier, have played out before in similar areas of Antarctica and indeed, the pace of ice loss was equal to our worst fears about a runaway ice loss.”"

Follow:
The current El Niño is now one of the strongest on record, new data shows, catapulting it into rare “super El Niño” territory, but forecasters believe that La Niña is likely to develop in the coming months.
One of the main ways scientists determine whether El Niño is present, and a key indicator of its strength, is through ocean surface temperatures. And from November to January, the temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean where El Niño originates was 2 degrees Celsius warmer than normal, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction center – a threshold that has only been breached six times on record. It means a very strong El Niño is ongoing.
But this so-called super El Niño’s strength won’t last long – it has reached its peak strength and is headed on a downward trend, said Michelle L’Heureux, a climate scientist with the Climate Prediction Center.
“We’re slightly past peak [strength] at this point,” L’Heureux told CNN.
Forecasters believe the switch could get totally flipped to La Niña – cooler than average conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific – as soon as summer, but more likely by fall, and issued a La Niña watch on Thursday.
El Niño influences weather around the globe, so its strength and demise will continue to have an impact on the weather we experience in the coming months.
The stronger an El Niño gets, the more likely it is to influence the global weather over time. But its impact is measured on a seasonal timescale, and not in terms of individual weather events, L’Heureux explained.
El Niños have hallmark seasonal signs, particularly on winter in the US.
A warmer-than-average winter with less snow across the northern tier of the US is one of these signs. This exact scenario is unfolding this winter. Multiple states in the region experienced the warmest-ever December and an overall toasty January with paltry amounts of snow – a trend that’s continuing into February.
El Niño also manifests as a wetter-than-average winter for the southern tier of the US as it often points the storm-steering jet stream south.
A serious drought in parts of the South has largely been wiped out this winter by repeated bouts of rain from storm systems. And California was just deluged by back-to-back potent atmospheric river-fueled storms that unloaded record rainfall and hundreds of mudslides.
El Niño has been known to enhance atmospheric river events on the West Coast.
“It’s difficult to attribute any single weather system or series of them to El Niño. With that said, it seems probable that there were some links to El Niño [with California’s storms],” L’Heureux noted.
The additional source of heat from warmer water in the eastern Pacific Ocean can be especially impactful to weather patterns in the western portions of both Americas that border the Pacific.
The recent disastrous, deadly fires in Chile reflect the El Niño connection. The pattern is linked to decreased precipitation in the northern part of the country which contributed to extensive drought that left areas tinder-dry.
El Niño has also left its fingerprints on temperature and precipitation patterns in several other continents, including South America, Africa, Australia and parts of Asia, according to L’Heureux.
But L’Heureux is careful to caution that not every extreme weather event can be attributed directly to El Niño in a warming world.
“El Niño impacts don’t occur in isolation anymore. There’s certainly a climate change component,” L’Heureux said.
Human-caused climate change is driving up global temperatures, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events.
La Niña watch issued
A La Niña watch is now in effect, meaning conditions are favorable for a La Niña to form within the next six months, according to a forecast released by the CPC Thursday.
The center is eyeing this transition to unfold during the summer months, with La Niña conditions increasingly likely to be in effect through the fall.
There is a 55% chance of La Niña to develop from June to August and a 77% chance from September to November, according to L’Heureux and the forecast.
This abrupt pattern flip is not unprecedented. Historically, strong El Niños are followed by La Niña conditions about 60% of the time, L’Heureux said.
Depending on when – or even if – La Niña materializes, this large-scale pattern flip could have significant implications for how the rest of the year’s weather plays out.
La Niñas often produce the opposite weather patterns as El Niño, including a more active Atlantic hurricane season. La Niña conditions were in place for a portion of the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record: 2020.
A quicker switch to La Niña could mean more of an impact on the upcoming hurricane season, which begins in June and typically peaks in September – particularly if oceans stay exceptionally warm.
Last year’s Atlantic hurricane season was unusually active amid record warm oceans, despite attempts by El Niño to tamp down activity.

Heat records on land and sea have tumbled over the past year
Climate crisis driven primarily by humans burning coal, oil and gas
Average global sea surface temperature for January was hottest on record
Extreme weather events supercharged by El Niño, scientists say
Global warming surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past 12 months for the first time on record, new data shows, breaching a critical threshold that, if it continues, will push the limits of life on Earth to adapt.
The past year was 1.52 degrees hotter on average than temperatures before industrialization, according to data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate and weather monitoring service. That 12-month average was boosted by the hottest January on record, which was 1.66 degrees warmer than the average January temperature in pre-industrial times.
Keeping global warming below 2 degrees, but preferably 1.5, was the centerpiece goal of the Paris Agreement, which most of the world’s nations signed onto in 2015.
Scientists are more concerned with ﻿multi-year warming above these thresholds, but the 12-month record shows the world is fast approaching the Paris Agreement’s limits.
Matt Patterson, a postdoctoral research assistant in atmospheric physics at the University of Oxford, said the record was a “significant milestone,” but didn’t mean the Paris Agreement had failed.
“However, exceeding 1.5C in one year underlines the rapidly shrinking window of time humanity has to make deep emissions cuts and avoid dangerous climate change.”
Heat records on land and sea have tumbled over the past year. The last eight months in a row have been the hottest such months on record, Copernicus said, while 2023 was the hottest calendar year.
The average global sea surface temperature for January was also the hottest on record for that month by a large margin: 0.26 degrees warmer than the previous record, set in 2016.
“2024 starts with another record-breaking month – not only is it the warmest January on record but we have also just experienced a 12-month period of more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial reference period,” Copernicus Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said in a statement. “Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing.”
The climate crisis is driven primarily from humans burning coal, oil and gas for energy. El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean, has also boosted temperatures in much of the world in recent months.
Extreme weather events already made more frequent and severe by long-term global warming are now being supercharged by El Niño, scientists say. The combination of the two has proved particularly destructive.
More than 160 wildfires that spread over an area of Chile this week have killed more than 120 people and reduced entire neighborhoods to ashes, making them the deadliest blazes in the country’s recent history.
The twin threat also supercharged the California storms this week, scientists said, enhancing rainfall and boosting the storm’s destructive power."

Follow:
The European Commission announced one of the world’s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution on Tuesday, but protesting farmers and upcoming elections could threaten its success, analysts say.
The Commission — which is part of the European Union’s executive government — is backing a 90% cut in carbon emissions by 2040, from 1990 levels, taking a stance that is likely to set a benchmark for developed nations around the world.
EU Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra made the announcement in parliament, and a roadmap outlining how to reach the target was published by the Commission shortly after, touching on the future of fossil fuels, transportation and industry.
The announcement will kick off months of talks that could take up to a year before the European Parliament rubber stamps the target.
The Commission removed a separate target for climate action in the agricultural sector that had appeared in an earlier draft, obtained by CNN. It is a concession to European farmers who have been protesting for weeks, some of whom had explicitly rallied against climate policies they consider a threat to their livelihoods.
The earlier draft had called for a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, compared to 2015 levels.
Questions are now being raised over whether the EU can deliver, and not only because of its farmers. The 27-nation bloc already has a 55% emissions reduction target for 2030, but the Commission warned in December that member states were off track to reach that goal.
While there is fairly broad support for the new 90% target — which was the minimum recommended by the EU’s scientific advisory body — deliberations on how to achieve it may take a radical turn in June, when the EU holds elections for the European Parliament, the bloc’s legislative body.
The European Greens — a faction of environmentally conscious lawmakers from several countries — are expecting big losses in the vote, after making sweeping gains in the 2019 election.
Conservative and far-right parties are forecast to snap up many of those lost seats, putting the EU’s more ambitious climate goals at risk.
A new-look parliament might choose to keep the 90% goal, said Manon Dufour, executive director of the climate think tank E3G’s Brussels office, but there will likely be sticking points over issues like agriculture and when to ban the sale of combustion engine cars.
“This might be a bit of a new world that we are entering, where the parliament might not be the most progressive institution, which has been the status quo until now,” Dufour told CNN. “Of course, the political makeup of the European Parliament will have an impact on European action across the board, whether it’s on markets, or foreign policy, or climate.”
One of the biggest changes that a more conservative EU parliament might see is more resistance to increased regulation, Dufour said, particularly outright bans.
“We’re looking at a European Parliament that is more in favor of regulatory freedom for member states,” Dufour said. “So that could also impact some of the policies going forward, being more skeptical of environmental policies and climate policies.”
Already, the EU’s center-right alliance, the European People’s Party (EPP), is seeking to roll back key elements of the EU’s broader Green Deal, such as a ban on the sale of combustion engine cars by 2035, aimed at phasing in electric vehicles more widely.
The EPP is pitching itself as the champion of farmers ahead of the June election and has been vocal in its opposition to the EU’s environmental policies in agriculture.
Bas Eickhout, who was elected to co-lead the European Greens alliance in parliament at the weekend, accepts the Greens are likely to lose seats in June, and that may weaken EU climate action.
“It’s clear that we will be challenged this campaign,” said Eickhout, who is also a Dutch politician. In 2019, green issues were a priority for many voters, he said. “It was a kind of climate election,” he told CNN.
The Greens had been successful in achieving a strong climate agenda through the EU parliament, he added. “And now there’s a bit of a pushback on it.”
Eickhout said that the EU’s climate program had, at times, failed to be inclusive of everyday Europeans, including farmers.
“It’s clear that there needs to be a more sustainable model for agriculture, but we also understand why farmers feel how they [do] with their backs against the wall,” Eickhout said. “If you say you have to change your entire agriculture system, of course you get resistance. I would also resist, especially if I’m not even sure I can make a living out of it now.”
The Greens will campaign in the upcoming elections for even more ambitious climate targets, including reaching net zero by 2040, 10 years before the current goal. But it will also seek to include more social policy in the Green Deal, the EU’s overarching climate plan.
Linda Kalcher, executive director of the Brussel-based climate think tank Strategic Perspectives, is more optimistic. She said new conservative or even far-right lawmakers may also back some ambitious climate policies because so many make sense in terms of economics and security, as well.
Kalcher said that recent years had shown that economics and energy security were boosting the green transition, rather than climate policy alone.
“We clearly saw that the recovery has been green because that was the best opportunity to really make sectors thrive and create additional jobs in response to the pandemic. We also saw that in response to the war in Ukraine, leaders were increasing renewable energy targets and energy efficiency targets.”"
Should there be a Category 6 for hurricanes? These climate scientists say yes,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/05/weather/category-six-hurricanes-climate-scientists/index.html,"Should there be a Category 6 for hurricanes? These climate scientists say yes

As temperatures rise and the world’s oceans store more potential fuel for storms, a new study proposes adapting the scale that measures the intensity of hurricanes to account for stronger storms.
The Saffir-Simpson scale currently goes from Category 1 to 5; the study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, suggests adding a Category 6.
A Category 5 hurricane is a storm that has sustained winds of 157 mph or greater. The new scale would cap Category 5 storms at 192 mph and anything above 192 mph would become a Category 6 hurricane.
The study’s authors – Jim Kossin, a distinguished science advisor at the First Street Foundation, and Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory – argue as climate change leads to soaring ocean temperatures, the potential wind intensity of hurricanes – also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons in oceans outside the Atlantic and East Pacific – is increasing.
In fact, of the 197 tropical cyclones worldwide that reached Category 5 status between 1980 and 2021, five exceeded the hypothetical Category 6 threshold, the study found. All five occurred since 2013, including 2015’s Hurricane Patricia, which hit Mexico, and Super Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines in 2013.
But the idea of adding a Category 6 to the scale is nothing new: It’s been discussed for years.
The Saffir-Simpson scale, which has been around since the early 1970s, also has limitations in that it is only a wind scale and does not include the impacts of storm surge and rain-induced flooding, which can be the most deadly and damage-causing aspects of landfalling storms.
As the planet warms, these impacts of hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. Sea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland storm surge can travel, and a warmer climate also means there will be more water vapor available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain."

Using sponges collected off the coast of Puerto Rico in the eastern Caribbean, scientists have calculated 300 years of ocean temperatures and concluded the world has already overshot one crucial global warming limit and is speeding toward another.
These findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, are alarming but also controversial. Other scientists say the study contains too many uncertainties and limitations to draw such firm conclusions and could end up confusing public understanding of climate change.
Sponges — which grow slowly, layer by layer — can act like data time capsules, allowing a glimpse into what the ocean was like hundreds of years ago, long before the existence of modern data.
Using samples from sclerosponges, which live for centuries, the team of international scientists was able to calculate ocean surface temperatures going back 300 years.
They found human-caused warming may have started earlier than currently assumed and, as a result, global average temperature may have already warmed more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Researchers say the results also suggest global temperature could overshoot 2 degrees of warming by the end of the decade.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries pledged to restrict global warming to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The pre-industrial era — or the state of the climate before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels and warming the planet — is commonly defined as 1850-1900.
The study authors argue their findings suggest the pre-industrial era should be pushed further back to between the 1700s and 1860. Changing that baseline would mean the world has already warmed at least 1.7 degrees (scientists say long-term global warming currently stands at between 1.2 to 1.3 degrees).
“The big picture is that global warming, and the urgent need for emission reductions to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change, has been brought forward by at least a decade,” Malcolm McCulloch, lead author of the study and marine geochemist at the University of Western Australia, said at a news briefing. “So, this is a major change to thinking about global warming.”
However, several climate scientists have questioned the study’s findings, especially using one type of sponge from one location in the Caribbean to represent global temperatures. Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist, said estimating global average temperature requires data from as many locations as possible, as climate varies across the planet.
“Claims that records from a single record can confidently define the global mean warming since the pre-industrial are probably overreaching,” he said in a statement.
Gabi Hegerl, a professor of climate system science at the University of Edinburgh, said the study was “a nice new record that illustrates how temperatures in the Caribbean started to rise over the industrial period.” But, she added in a statement, “the interpretation in terms of global warming goals overstretches it.”
Some went further. Yadvinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, said the way the findings have been communicated were “flawed” and have “the potential to add unnecessary confusion to public debate on climate change.”
A co-author of the study defended its robustness and argued that temperature changes in the part of the Caribbean the sponges came from have always mimicked changes around the globe.
“It’s probably one of the best areas if you’re trying to figure out global averaging on the Earth,” said Amos Winter, a professor of geology at Indiana State University. Ocean temperatures in the region are predominantly affected by planet-heating pollution, rather than natural climate variability like El Niño, he said.
Whatever the baseline for measuring global warming, what remains clear, experts say, is that the impacts will worsen with every fraction of a degree of warming.
“It’s exciting to see new research that allows us to peek centuries in the past,” said Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. But, he added, “relabeling the warming that has occurred until today by using a different starting point does not change the impacts we are seeing today, or the impacts we are aiming to avoid.”
Winter hopes the study will function as a call to action. “Hopefully this will help change our viewpoints of what is happening in the globe, make us act now, and not wait for some disaster to happen for us to change our habits.”"

Punxatawney Phil, the central character of the annual rite of winter known as Groundhog’s Day, isn’t great at his job. His predictions are wrong more often than they are right.
On Friday, the divining marmot did not see his shadow, indicating an early spring. Though, technically speaking, winter will end on the spring equinox, which falls on the evening of March 19.
But the groundhog is just one of numerous animals that, according to folklore, possess an uncanny ability to forecast the weather, including cows that are said to lie down before early rain and woolly bear caterpillars that are supposedly decorated with less color before a frigid winter.
Most of these associations are unmoored from modern science — but there is an occasional hint of documented fact among the myths.
Phenology is the study of how seasonal events in the lives of plants and animals shift according to the weather and climate, such as how fish or migratory birds respond to the temperature of water and air. (The field of study can be practiced as a hard science, for the record, and is entirely distinct from the pseudoscientific “phrenology.”)
The USA National Phenology Network tracks when ecological markers of spring arrive across the United States — and the season is already in bloom in certain locations on the east and west coasts.
Theresa Crimmins, the director of the USA National Phenology Network, said that while Punxatawney Phil is not a reliable predictor of spring’s arrival, phenology does offer scientific backing for other seemingly superstitious axioms about the natural world.
“People have been observing (environmental conditions) for many millennia, for basically as long as humans have been around,” Crimmins said. “So (a lot of these adages) actually work because they are, in a sense, capturing those relationships between the environmental conditions and plant response.”
But while folklore often supposes animal behavior portends future weather events, in reality, flora and fauna react to weather and climate.
The roots of Groundhog Day lie in traditions that were likely imported to the United States from Germany, where the winter-forecasting animal was a badger rather than a groundhog.
However, numerous tried-and-true proverbs about the natural world come from Native American populations.
“One example is planting corn when oak leaves are the size of a squirrel’s ear,” notes an article on phenology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “You know that planting corn has nothing to do with oak leaves or squirrels. However, Native Americans made the observation centuries ago that the soil was warm enough to prevent seeds from rotting, yet it was still early enough to reap a suitable harvest if corn was planted at this time.”
Crimmins points out that there are plenty of other predictors for coming ecological events spelled out in the leaves, berries and flowers of plants.
For example, the shadblow serviceberry is a small tree that is native to parts of eastern North America, and it’s believed that its name came from the fact that it bears flowers at the same time of year that shad fish begin their river migration. The Lenape and other Native American populations made note of the phenomenon long ago and prepared to fish when the plant began to bloom.
The Old Farmer’s Almanac  has aggregated a couple dozen adages about insects, animals and their ability to predict weather patterns.
Some of the claims are dubious. Dogs eating grass, for example, is likely a far less accurate predictor of rain than a meteorologist’s weather report.
But there is research out there that suggests some animals may possess an innate sense that helps them detect when a disaster is on the way.
Golden-winged warblers, for example, evacuated an area of Tennessee more than 24 hours before a devastating string of tornadoes hit the area, according to a December 2014 study published in the journal Current Biology.
The study authors predicted the migrant birds listened to infrasound — sound at frequencies too low for humans to hear — associated with the storms and heeded it as a warning sign.
Researchers in Germany also looked into whether various species of animals could detect an oncoming earthquake. The scientists found that, collectively, animals including cows, sheep and dogs exhibited more activity before an earthquake up to 20 hours in advance, according to a report from Germany’s Max Planck Society, a nonprofit association of research institutes.
There is also truth to the notion that crickets can act as nature’s thermometer. The insects are ectotherms, meaning their body temperature changes with that of their surrounding environment — and they routinely chirp faster in warmer weather.
According to Dolbear’s Law, a formula describing this association between crickets and weather, “you can count the number of chirps per 15 seconds, add 40, and that will give you the temperature in Fahrenheit,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notes.
Frogs also deliver unique calls when it’s about to rain.
“Many twentieth-century herpetologists have confirmed and clarified the traditional observation that various species of frogs sometimes utter a distinctive vocalization, a ‘rain call,’ a short time before wet weather,” said Dr. Gordon Miller, a professor emeritus of environmental studies at Seattle University, via email.
The calls “are perhaps triggered by a rise in humidity prior to precipitation,” Miller said.
Other tropes about animals’ ability to predict seasonal conditions, however, are wrong.
The woolly bear — a species of caterpillar, also called the woolly worm — famously is thought to forecast the severity of the impending winter with its colored bands. More black coloring on the insect supposedly indicates harsher conditions on the way.
But in reality, the “caterpillar’s coloring is based on how long (the) caterpillar has been feeding, its age, and species,” according to the National Weather Service. “The better the growing season is the bigger it will grow. This results in narrower red-orange bands in its middle. Thus, the width of the banding is an indicator of the current or past season’s growth rather than an indicator of the severity of the upcoming winter.”
Unusual animal behavior can also be a reaction to a changing climate, Crimmins emphasized. And often not in good ways.
The climate crisis and human development are causing all sorts of ecological problems, Crimmins noted. Bears, for example, are entering hibernation later and arising earlier because of the warmer weather. That can lead to more human-bear interactions  as bears search for food, and there is concern about how shorter hibernation periods are affecting bear pregnancies.
Miller added that, while frogs may be able to foretell incoming rainfall, “with so many amphibian species continuing to decline due to various environmental and climatic factors, perhaps their most clarion call to us today, as Rachel Carson noted of birds in 1962, is their diminishing chorus and growing silence.”"

The first of two atmospheric rivers is unloading heavy snow at high elevations and gusty winds and soaking rainfall Thursday across a large part of California.
More than 20 million people are under flood alerts as storms threaten flash flooding in cities including Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland. The threat will last into Friday morning for central and Southern California.
Floodwaters began to rise as rain pounded parts of Southern California Thursday morning, forcing parts of the Pacific Coast Highway and the 710 Freeway to close and leading to a handful of water rescues.
Long Beach – south of downtown Los Angeles – bore the brunt of the dangerous flooding.  Videos posted to social media showed some Long Beach roadways completely underwater. Vehicles splashed and made waves while driving through the high water.  At least one car was submerged up to its windshield.
Fire crews had to rescue people from a few submerged vehicles from an area road, Long Beach Fire Capt. Jack Crabtree told CNN. No one was injured.

First responders in nearby Orange County rescued a man who became trapped in a storm channel after heavy rain turned it into a quickly flowing river Thursday. He was taken to a hospital in stable condition, fire officials said.
While there may be a brief respite after Thursday’s storm drenches Southern California, another atmospheric river – likely stronger – is poised to move across the region beginning Sunday.
Rainy conditions are expected to continue well into February as a more typical El Niño pattern kicks into gear.
El Niño – a natural phenomenon in the tropical Pacific that influences weather around the globe – causes changes in the jet stream that can point storms directly at California. Storms can also tap into an extra-potent supply of moisture from the tropics called an atmospheric river.
On Wednesday, the first of two atmospheric river storms slammed into Northern California.
Steady rainfall and periods of stronger winds from the storm will impact Southern California into at least early Friday. Much cooler air will also begin to overspread the state during this time.
Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches is possible in the southern part of the state, falling at rates that could exceed 1 inch per hour.
A Level 2 out of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place Thursday for Southern California. Roads and low-lying areas are at the most risk for flooding, and rises on some waterways are also possible.

Flood watches across central California will remain in effect through Thursday night. An additional inch of rain is possible across the region Thursday. The coastal ranges picked up 2 to 4 inches of rain through Wednesday night, while valley areas recorded 0.5 to 1.5 inches.
Meanwhile, the western half of California could see a few thunderstorms that may produce bursts of heavier rain. This would come after a series of torrential thunderstorms wreaked havoc on San Diego last week.
San Diego officials warned of potential evacuations in flood prone areas, including some that flooded last week.
“This warning is voluntary. It is designed to encourage residents in these flood-prone communities to prepare if, or when, an evacuation order does become necessary,” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said in a Tuesday news release.
Swift water personnel and equipment are ready to respond in 12 California counties, with 400 personnel prepped across 16 counties, the state Office of Emergency Services said.
“The state is working around the clock with our local partners to deploy life-saving equipment and resources statewide,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said.
Snow is also a threat
Farther north, officials are also preparing to respond to a bout of wintery weather conditions.
More snow is expected to accumulate at lower elevations across parts of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada on Thursday as cooler temperatures move in. Up to 4 feet of snow could bury the highest peaks of the Sierras, with at least 6 inches of snow possible for some lower-elevation mountain roadways.
The snow is welcomed for California’s snowpack, which has been beleaguered by warmth and storms that have brought more rain than snow. This winter’s snowpack is just 52% of average for this time of year, according to the latest survey conducted Tuesday by the state’s Department of Water Resources. Snowpack is a vital water source, and the survey helps California to forecast how much water will be available for the remainder of the year.
‘Largest storm of the season’ to begin this weekend
Friday will bring showery weather that’s expected to linger over much of California as moisture slowly pushes out and across the Southwest.
Then on Sunday, another more potent atmospheric river-fueled storm is poised to lash Southern California. That could become the “largest storm of the season,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned.
“It is very likely that this will be a serious 2 to 3 day storm system,” meteorologists there said.
While more details on this storm are still coming into focus, forecast models show a more widespread and prolonged flood threat, especially for Southern California. At the very least, another few days of rain and snow are likely across the rest of the state.
The second storm could potentially stall over the region and unload several inches of rain from Sunday to about midweek.
Temperatures are also likely to start out much cooler with this storm than with the first storm, with more snow possible down to mountain pass levels or potentially even lower elevations.

El Niño hasn’t materialized many atmospheric rivers for California so far this winter, with most hitting the Pacific Northwest.
But all of that is changing this week.
The first of the two potent atmospheric river storms started slamming Northern California Wednesday morning and will sweep down the state through Wednesday night and target Southern California Thursday.
Over an inch of rain soaked elevated areas near the coast in Northern California by Wednesday morning. Strong winds roared in the same areas in the meantime, producing gusts of 50 to 70 mph that knocked out power for some.
Rain and breezy conditions began in the Bay Area late Wednesday morning but the storm’s worst will soak and buffet the area through Wednesday evening.
The storm is starting out very warm – fueled by moisture from near Hawaii that earns it the moniker of a pineapple express – and will unload mainly rain in all but the absolute highest elevations in Northern California Wednesday. Central California should expect steady rain and gusty winds to begin late Wednesday and continue into Thursday.
Steady rainfall and periods of stronger winds will arrive in Southern California by Thursday morning. At the same time, much cooler air will begin to overspread the state.
More snow will accumulate and at lower elevations across parts of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada Thursday as cooler temperatures take over. Feet of snow could bury the highest peaks of the Sierras, with at least 6 inches of snow possible for some lower-elevation mountain roadways.
The snow is welcomed for California’s snowpack, which has been beleaguered by warmth and storms that have brought more rain than snow. This winter’s snowpack is just 52% of average for this time of year, according to the latest survey conducted by the state’s Department of Water Resources Tuesday. Snowpack is a vital water source, and the survey helps California to forecast how much water will be available for the rest of the year.
A few thunderstorms could rumble to life in the western half of California on Thursday and may produce bursts of heavier rain. A series of torrential thunderstorms fueled a prolific rainfall event that plunged San Diego underwater last week.
Flooding is possible across a significant portion of California Wednesday and Thursday. A Level 2 out of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place Wednesday for portions of Northern and Central California, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The same risk level exits Thursday for Southern California as the rain shifts south.
Roadways and low-lying areas are at the most risk for flooding, but rises on some waterways are possible.
Showery weather will linger across much of California Friday as moisture slowly pushes out and across the Southwest.
More potent atmospheric river event arrives Sunday
Respite from soaking weather in California will be brief: a second, more potent atmospheric river-fueled storm is expected to arrive Sunday.
The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday could kick off the “largest storm of the season.” “It is very likely that this will be a serious 2 to 3 day storm system,” meteorologists there said.
Full details on this storm are still coming into focus, but forecast models are pointing to a more widespread and prolonged flood threat, especially for Southern California. At the very least, another few days of rain and snow are likely across the rest of the state.
The second storm looks to tap into even more robust moisture from an atmospheric river than the first, with the potential to stall over the region and unload several inches of rain from Sunday to around midweek.
Temperatures are also likely to start out much cooler with this storm than with the first storm, with more snow possible down to mountain pass levels or potentially even lower elevations.
A wet, cooler pattern is likely to extend well after the second atmospheric river wraps up.
Below average temperatures and above average precipitation amounts are likely to persist into mid-February, according to outlooks produced by the Climate Prediction Center.

The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/shipping-pollution-global-warming-climate-intl/index.html,"The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?
Follow:
The huge cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans sometimes leave “tracks” in their wake — long, wispy clouds that trail through the sky, lasting for a handful of days at most before disappearing.
These ghost clouds look beautiful, but they are a visible sign of deadly air pollution. They form when tiny sulfur dioxide particles belched out from ships’ smokestacks interact with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating low-lying, highly reflective clouds.
Ships’ sulfur pollution causes tens of thousands of premature deaths a year. But in what may seem a cruel twist — especially from an industry responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by brightening clouds and reflecting the sun’s energy away from the Earth.
So, when in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations body regulating shipping, slashed sulfur content permitted in ships’ fuel by 80%, it was a victory for human health. An estimated 30,000 premature deaths will now be avoided each year.
But it was “a silver cloud with a dark lining,” said Michael Diamond, assistant professor at Florida State University’s Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. The regulations ended a vast, accidental geoengineering project. Ship tracks reduced sharply, and with them, the cooling impact of this pollution.
As global temperatures soar, it has left scientists﻿ trying to unpick whether these shipping regulations may be inadvertently fueling an alarming acceleration of global warming — a controversial hypothesis that has divided some experts.
It’s a debate made more urgent by last year’s record-breaking heat. “Scientists are amazed at the outlier that 2023 was,” said Olaf Morgenstern, a scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand.
The heat was especially pronounced in some parts of the oceans, where water temperatures in areas including the North Atlantic shot wildly off the charts.
Scientists say the surge in global temperature was primarily driven by two factors: the impacts of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that tends to have a global heating impact, combined with the backdrop of long-term global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
But some have speculated the heat spiked so abnormally high that other influences may also be at play. Theories include a lack of sunlight-reflecting dust from the Sahara, a change in wind patterns, and the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga underwater volcano, which injected enough planet-warming water vapor into the atmosphere to fill 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.
Of all of the theories, however, the impact of shipping regulations is swiftly becoming one of the most discussed. Scientists have long known that reducing this particle pollution﻿ would have a warming effect, but by how much “is where the controversy starts,” Morgenstern said.
In November, the prominent climate scientist James Hansen co-authored a paper which argued the curtailing of shipping pollution was the main driver of an alarming acceleration in global warming that goes beyond what climate models have predicted.
The IMO shipping regulations were “an unintentional scientific experiment,” Hansen told CNN. His research predicted global temperatures would breach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in the 2020s and 2 degrees in the 2050s — a catastrophic level of warming that could trigger a slew of climate tipping points.
But other scientists have urged caution, not least because the relationship between pollution particles and clouds is extremely complex. Unraveling it is “one of the biggest challenges in climate science,” Diamond said.
Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at Leeds University in the UK, said the reduction in shipping pollution is likely to have a very small warming influence.
According to Forster’s calculations, the regulations will increase global warming by around 0.01 degrees Celsius, which could grow to about 0.05 degrees by 2050 — equivalent to around two additional years of human-caused emissions.
However, he added, the uncertain effect of the pollution on clouds means there’s a possibility the warming impact could be much larger — an additional 0.1 or 0.2 degrees by 2050.
Diamond, whose own work estimates the regulations will bring levels of warming over the next few decades of between 0.05 and 0.1 degrees, said this heat won’t be “a showstopper” but is important. Every fraction of a degree matters when the world is hurtling towards levels of warming to which even humans will increasingly struggle to adapt.
Diamond, along with most of the other scientists CNN spoke to, doesn’t believe the decline in shipping pollution was a major factor in last year’s global heat, not least because there is usually a time lag before changes in the atmosphere are reflected in the Earth’s temperature.
“But I think it could have mattered quite a bit more regionally,” he said. Shipping is unevenly distributed, with much of it concentrated between Europe, North America and Asia, meaning air pollution impacts are also likely to be skewed.
In areas such as the North Atlantic, where temperatures soared several degrees above usual in 2023, Diamond said, “shipping is a decent explanation for part of why that was so warm.”
There are only a few years of data so far, and it will take time for scientists to unravel the exact impact of the fall in shipping pollution.
But it is clear that particle pollution from all sources, including burning fossil fuels, has had a cooling impact. Without it, the world would be about 0.4 degrees hotter, according to a 2021 report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And pollution decreases in the future could have a big impact.
Annica Ekman, professor of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden, said her research has found that decreases in human-caused particle pollution between 2015 and 2050 could warm the planet as much as 0.5 degrees.
But this is not an argument against cutting air pollution, Diamond said, it’s an argument for tackling it alongside reducing carbon emissions.
The cooling impact of air pollution is far outweighed by the heating impact of burning fossil fuels. It’s when air pollution is tackled without also reducing carbon emissions, that “we can get into trouble,” Diamond said.
That is what’s happening in this shipping industry, where huge container vessels are still propelled across the oceans by hundreds of millions of tons of fossil fuels.
“We must not forget why the regulation exists,” Forster said. “It is there to save lives from air pollution.” While reducing this pollution will have a small warming impact, immediate action to reduce emissions will both slash the rate of global warming and improve air quality, he said. We are not “on some doomed trajectory,” he added."

Follow:
The Biden administration is contemplating an overhaul of the way federal agencies approve massive natural gas export projects to allow for consideration what the climate impact of those facilities would be, according to an environmental advocacy source familiar with the plans.
The overhaul would effectively pause the federal approval process for a massive and controversial gas export project known as CP2, the source said – a facility that is being proposed for the southwest Louisiana coast, as well as other natural gas projects that are pending federal approval.
The administration’s potential change in posture on these facilities comes as President Joe Biden gears up for a tough reelection campaign, seeking to win the support of young, climate-minded voters. Environmental groups have recently turned their focus to the surge of new and planned fossil fuel infrastructure along the Gulf Coast – and the Biden administration’s role in approving it.
The administration is considering a broad overhaul of how the Department of Energy makes so-called public interest determinations – a key step needed to approve liquified natural gas facilities. This could include updating how the administration determines climate impacts of these projects, modernizing and updating the climate impact considerations, and considering the full upstream and downstream life cycle impacts of these projects, the source said.
The Energy Department, which is responsible for making public interest determinations as one step in the approval process, has never rejected a proposed natural gas project on these grounds.
The White House declined to comment. The Department of Energy did not return CNN’s request for comment. The New York Times and Bloomberg also reported the administration is considering changes to how it approves natural gas projects.
Natural gas is big business for the US fossil fuel industry, which has been exporting much of the product to other countries, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent move away from Russian gas. US companies have stepped in to fill that gap, compressing or freezing gas at export terminals and shipping it across the ocean in enormous tankers.
Biden is facing pressure on all sides as climate groups push back on the continued greenlighting of natural gas projects and the fossil fuel industry continues to invest in them. The CP2 project, which could export up to 20 million tons of natural gas a year, is the largest natural gas export facility proposed to date in the US and has been the subject of contentious debate.
Shaylyn Hynes, a spokesperson for CP2’s owner Venture Global, said the reported plans from the Biden administration would “create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on US LNG for their energy security” and would “shock the global energy market.”
Environmental groups, who maintain the US is already producing and exporting enough gas to satisfy the energy needs of its foreign allies, cheered the plan.
“That decision would be one we would get behind; these LNG export projects have been rubber stamped up to this point,” said Mahyar Sorour, the director of beyond fossil fuels policy at the Sierra Club. “We’re encouraged.”

Follow:
The West’s recent heat-driven megadroughts are unprecedented in at least 500 years, new research shows.
“Hot drought” — when extreme drought and heat occur simultaneously — has increased in severity and frequency over the last century due to human-caused climate change, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.
“What we’re seeing is that megadrought conditions are being amplified by anthropogenically driven (human caused) temperature increases,” said Karen King, lead author of the study and assistant professor in physical geography at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
Wednesday’s study builds on previous research, including one study that found the last two decades in the West have been the driest in 1,200 years, and the human-caused climate crisis made the yearslong dry spell 72% worse.
Both studies used tree ring data, which can serve as scientific time capsules as they are affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature, allowing researchers to reconstruct the past.
While the previous study measured the length and width of the tree rings to gauge drought conditions, King’s research analyzed the density of the rings to measure how temperatures changed over time.
“More dense rings mean warmer temperatures, and less dense rings mean cooler temperatures, typically,” King explained.
She spent the last few years driving around the Pacific Northwest and the Interior Mountain West, including parts of Utah, Arizona and Colorado, to measure different tree species.
After collecting tree ring data to analyze summer maximum temperatures across the region from 1553 to 2020 as well as existing historical drought records, King and her team were able to corroborate that the last two decades have been among the hottest years on record in at least five centuries across much of the western US.
“It wasn’t that surprising, but when you put the two (studies) together, it paints a very cohesive picture that this anthropogenic influence on increased hot drought, particularly in the Southwest, is unprecedented over the last several centuries.”
While droughts have frequented the West in the past, researchers say the effects are much more pronounced today due to alarmingly high temperatures. And the water supply has taken a large hit.
According to the study, the regions most affected by hot droughts include the Great Plains, which contain the Ogallala aquifer — one of the country’s largest that supports nearly 25% of the region’s agriculture — and portions of the Colorado River Basin, which has been plagued by extreme drought and overuse in recent decades.
Jonathan Overpeck, climate scientist and dean of the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, told CNN the implications are huge if the climate crisis accelerates.
“Water security and wildfire will become bigger problems until climate change is stopped,” said Overpeck, who was not involved with the study but has done research on hot droughts. “These impacts were predicted long ago and are now becoming clear.”"

Follow:
Icy conditions are making for hazardous travel as freezing rain pelts large sections of the central US Monday. The freezing rain is being made possible by a large push of milder air slowly starting to overspread much of the winter-weary US.
A barrage of back-to-back winter storms this month have left at least 90 people dead in 13 states as severe conditions have left people crushed under fallen trees, trapped in tornadoes or tangled in snowy car accidents. Tennessee has experienced the brunt of the fatalities, with 34 storm-related deaths.
Now people from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes are seeing accumulating ice and freezing rain Monday. Weather officials and several local transportation departments have warned drivers to exercise caution – or stay off the roads entirely.
“Icy roads will make driving hazardous. Use extra caution and drive slowly!” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Morning commuters in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas discovered slick sidewalks and icy roadways Monday. At least a glaze of ice was reported in each state, according to National Weather Service data.
Even small amounts of ice are enough to cause significant issues on untreated, paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks. Areas that receive greater amounts of ice are more likely to endure tree damage and power outages.
Several school districts across the region have canceled classes Monday, including in Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley have been showered with rain and thunderstorms as a wave of warm air engulfs the region. Unseasonably warm air will go on to overrun more of the US as the week progresses.
Ice, freezing rain create perilous conditions
Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico began pushing northward over the weekend and into Monday, colliding with the cold air still hovering over parts of the central US to create ice and freezing rain conditions over the Plains and Midwest.
More than 50 million people from Arkansas to the Great Lakes are under winter weather alerts Monday, prompting road hazard warnings in several states.
Ice began to build up on bridges and overpasses in the area Sunday night, the weather service in Tulsa said in a forecast message. The forecasters warned drivers to use “extreme caution” if they have to travel and leave ample distance for stopping.
“Please slow down and use caution as rain may freeze to your vehicle while driving and roads that appear wet may actually be icy!” the Tulsa weather service said in a post.
In Missouri, videos on social media showed cars losing control traveling down an ice-covered hill. Elsewhere in the state, emergency responders literally spun out in any icy development.
Air travel was also hampered by the icy conditions. By Monday afternoon at least 850 flights were canceled in the US with more than 3,300 delayed. Cancellations jumped early Monday for Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and the St. Louis Lambert International Airport due to freezing rain in the vicinity of each airport.
In Memphis, Tennessee, cold temperatures caused water mains to break, leaving thousands with their service interrupted over the weekend, Memphis Light, Gas, and Water CEO Doug McGowen said Sunday. Most should have their service restored by Monday, and a boil water advisory could be lifted by Thursday, McGowen said.
Separate from the early-week ice, brutal winter cold triggered time-sensitive rescues in Vermont. Twenty-three skiers and snowboarders were rescued after getting lost Saturday in the backcountry, according to the Killington Police Department, which deployed a team that “hiked, snowshoed and skinned approximately 5 miles, in frigid temperatures” to guide them to safety.
East preparing for dramatic warm-up
Significantly above-average temperatures will spread across the East by later in the week as a series of fronts and low-pressure systems usher in warmer air and tropical moisture.
After shivering through a frigid weekend, some cities will see daily high temperatures soar by nearly 30 degrees in the coming days.
Daily high temperatures across the region will tick up a few degrees each day through midweek before some of the warmest air arrives Thursday.
Thursday’s highs are set to hit the upper 60s and 70s in the Southeast and the 50s as far north as New York. More than 140 records for warmest daily lows could be broken by Friday in parts of the Southeast, where overnight lows will soar into the 60s.
The significant warm-up will not be confined only to the East. A large swath of the central US will also finally recover from the bone-chilling cold that persisted much of January.
“Temperatures thaw out this week & will stay well above normal through the end of January,” the weather service office in the Twin Cities posted on X, later adding a future of near-record highs “certainly looks possible, stay tuned!”
Though the rush of warm air will shake off the arctic blast that dominated much of the country’s weather through the weekend, it could usher in hazardous rain and flooding.
Rain, flood threat on the horizon
Heavy rain will bring a threat of flooding along the Gulf Coast and western portions of the Southeast until late in the week.
Approximately 37 million people across the affected areas are under threat of flash flooding and excessive rainfall through Thursday morning. As many as 5 to 6 inches of rain could fall by the end of the week, with some areas seeing even more.
Here’s a glimpse of where the heaviest rainfall is expected across the South through throughout the week:
• Monday – eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas• Tuesday – eastern Texas to Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee• Wednesday – Texas-Louisiana border to central Tennessee and northern Alabama• Thursday to Friday morning – Eastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to the far western corner of North Carolina
Some areas will be under a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall for several days in a row.

New artificial snowmaking technology could offer a lifeline to struggling ski resorts,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/travel/artificial-snowmaking-technology-climate-intl/index.html,"New artificial snowmaking technology could offer a lifeline to struggling ski resorts
Follow:
Nestled in the Pyrenees mountains, La Molina is Spain’s oldest ski resort. It boasts the biggest superpipe in the Pyrenees and its slopes have hosted high-profile events, from the Alpine Skiing World Cup to the Snowboard World Championships. But La Molina now faces an existential threat: A dearth of snow.
As global temperatures rise, the resort, like many around the world, is being forced to rely increasingly on artificial snow.
But fake snow comes at a cost. It is both water and energy intensive — a difficult combination anywhere but especially in a country grappling with a prolonged and severe drought fueled by climate change.
That’s why La Molina will spend the next three years testing a new snowmaking technique that promises to be far less resource intensive, as well as being able to produce snow at warmer temperatures — increasingly important as some resorts are approaching temperatures too warm to make even fake snow viable.
Called the Snow Laboratory, and run by the Barcelona Institute of Materials Science (ICMAB-CSIC) and FGC Turisme, which manages public ski slopes, the project will make fake snow by adding a mineral to the water going into snow guns, the machines that pump out water and air at high pressure to create snow.
The idea is to mimic processes that happen in the clouds, said Albert Verdaguer, the scientist at ICMAB-CSIC who has been leading the project.
Ice is formed in the atmosphere from water droplets in clouds by a process called “ice nucleation.” Pure water droplets can remain unfrozen in clouds at temperatures as low as minus 38 degrees Celsius. But ice nucleation can happen at much higher temperatures when the water droplets interact with particles in the atmosphere, such as aerosols or dust, triggering them to freeze.
A couple of years ago, Verdaguer read a research paper which found that one mineral — feldspar — was particularly efficient at this process and could trigger the freezing of water droplets at temperatures close to zero degrees.
It set off a lightbulb: What if feldspar could help make snowmaking more efficient? “We thought, why don’t we take advantage of that?” he told CNN.
During lab tests, Verdaguer and his team found the technique reduced energy costs by around 30% and was able to produce snow at temperatures around 1 to 1.5 degrees higher than traditional methods.
They were also able to get a better “conversion ratio,” Verdaguer said, referring to the volume of snow that comes out of the guns in relation to the amount of water that goes in.
Usually, it’s around 75%, he said, as some water remains in the gun or doesn’t freeze and is blown away. The Snow Laboratory expects to increase that to 90%.
Roughly a Coke can-sized amount of feldspar — an abundant mineral which makes up roughly 60% of the Earth’s crust — would keep two snow guns running all season, said Verdaguer.
An industry in peril
Spain has been struggling with scorching heat waves an﻿d a years-long drought, and Catalonia, the region where La Molina is located, has been particularly hard hit. It’s “one of the most intense droughts in recent years,” said Ramón Pascual Berghaenel, a meteorologist at Spain’s weather agency AEMET.
But La Molina is far from the only ski resort trying to plot a future in a warmer, dryer world. An unusually warm winter last year left ski resorts across Europe bare of snow, and this year, resorts in the Indian Himalayas lay empty as a lack of snow kept tourists away.
“Of course, there are shifts and changes year on year, but the long term trend (for snow) is decline,” said sports ecologist Madeleine Orr, who is not involved in the Snow Laboratory. Over the past four decades, human-caused global warming has led to reduced snow across much of the Northern Hemisphere, a recent study shows.
These changes mean artificial snow, used by resorts for decades, is increasingly becoming a lifeline. “Current best estimates are that 95% of ski resorts rely on snowmaking to some extent to remain viable,” Orr told CNN.
But as temperatures rise, there are questions over how viable snowmaking will be in the future. When it’s not cold enough, the machines simply won’t work.
That’s why Snow Laboratory’s new technique is so appealing.
The science makes sense, said Jordy Hendrikx, a leading snow scientist and the chief scientific advisor for Antarctica New Zealand. “It’s a question of whether that can be scaled,” Hendrikx,  who is not involved in the Snow Laboratory, told CNN.
That’s exactly what the La Molina project aims to do — to see if the lab results can be replicated in the real world.
For the past few weeks, Verdaguer and colleagues have been setting up the snow guns at the resort. The water will come from a reservoir which fills with melted snow from the mountains in the spring and isn’t used for drinking water.
As well as testing snowmaking efficiency, the project will undertake environmental tests to make sure there are no adverse impacts. Verdaguer is confident there won’t be, as feldspar is already widely used in glassmaking, ceramics and paints.
“If this new technology is able to produce snow with less water, and without adding extra chemical agents … that could be a huge win,” Orr said.
But Hendrikx warned that even if the technique lives up to its promise, it may not be enough. As temperatures and humidity levels continue to climb, he said, “the improvement you’ve got to make has to be quite significant to outweigh what the natural environment is producing.”
More broadly, Hendrickx believes snowmaking is a “maladaptation,” an attempt to adapt to climate change that can end up having a harmful effect. “You’re solving a problem locally, but you’re increasing the problem globally by your energy usage.”
Resorts could use green energy for fake snow, but as the world electrifies, Hendrikx said, this clean energy could arguably be better used elsewhere, “rather than making snow for a very small percentage of the population.”
And this hits on a bigger problem: Declining snowpack is a problem far beyond the ski industry. “Snow represents our water towers,” said Hendrikx, acting as free storage when people need it most. If it falls as rain, or melts earlier than usual, “we don’t have that trickle down later in the spring and the summer when we really need it.”
Hendrikx gets why resorts make snow. Mountain economies rely on it. Tourists have come to see snow as a resource that can be bent to their desire to ski or snowboard on powdery white slopes at certain times of the year.
Ultimately, resorts are not going to stop making snow any time soon, he said, so “any way we can find more efficient ways to do that, let’s get on it,” he said.
The next three years will see Snow Laboratory test its technique at La Molina but also eventually at two other ski resorts in the region to explore how well it works under different conditions.
The hope is this technology will give breathing room to struggling mountain communities that depend heavily on snow, Vedaguer said.
“We don’t want all the ski resorts to be closed in five years or 10 years, and not have had time to really think something through for the economy of the regions,” he said. “This is just to give us some time.”"

Warmth is set to thaw parts of the United States following frigid weekend temperatures – but the warmer air will bring a risk of ice and flooding for some states, and another crippling winter storm is set to hit portions of the Plains and South into Monday.
A series of winter storms this month have killed at least 82 people in 13 states. The death toll climbed on Sunday after emergency management agencies in Oregon, Mississippi and Tennessee reported additional weather-related fatalities.
Now a series of fronts and low-pressure systems are working together to bring warmer air and tropical moisture into the eastern half of the US this week.
The arctic chill will be ending, and cities will begin warming up, with some seeing daily high temperatures increase by close to 30 degrees over the course of three or four days.
Temperatures will be significantly above average by the end of the week, with highs Thursday reaching the upper 60s to low 70s throughout the Southeast and temperatures in the 50s as far north as New York.
Overnight lows will soar into the 60s for parts of the Southeast, potentially breaking over 100 records for warmest daily lows.
This warmer air will finally chase out the arctic blast that his been dominating the majority of the country’s weather this weekend, but will bring several potential hazards, including ice and flooding.
Ice, freezing rain to chill swath of central US
As moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is pushed northward Sunday into Monday, it will collide with cold air still lingering over portions of the central US to create ice and freezing rain in a wide swath from Dallas almost as far north as Fort Wayne, Indiana.
“Meanwhile, the presence of arctic air farther north will support mixed precipitation, sleet and ice as the moisture reaches into Oklahoma and Kansas tonight,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Multiple state transportation offices urged travelers to stay off the roads.
“Freezing rain is expected across most of the state overnight through Monday creating potentially icy conditions. Please avoid travel if possible or delay your trip,” the Missouri Department of Transportation said Sunday afternoon in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
In Arkansas, transportation officials warned Monday’s commute would be severely impacted as a result of freezing rain late Sunday evening into the start of the work week.
The National Weather Service issued an ice storm warning for parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma. A winter storm warning is also in effect for some areas of Oklahoma.
Weather service forecasters in Tulsa warned of “significant icing,” – between a quarter to a half-inch of ice accumulation – along with 15 to 20 mph sustained wind speeds and higher gusts.
“Scattered to numerous power outages may result from the combination of ice accumulation and wind,” Tulsa’s weather service office said in a forecast message.
The majority of the regions facing an icy forecast are likely to receive less than a quarter of an inch of ice by Monday evening, but up to half an inch of ice is in the forecast for northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, according to the National Weather Service.
Icy weather will shift to rain, flood threat
As the warm air continues its northward trajectory, freezing rain and icy precipitation will transition to rain, bringing the threat of flooding.
Approximately 37 million people are under threat of flash flooding and excessive rainfall this week from Monday to Thursday morning along the Gulf Coast and in the western portions of the Southeast.
There is a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall and flash flooding moving eastward throughout the week:
• Monday – eastern Texas• Tuesday – Lower Mississippi River Valley• Wednesday – Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee• Thursday to Friday morning – Gulf coast of Mississippi and Alabama into Tennessee
Some areas will be under a Level 2 risk of excessive rainfall for several days in a row.
Rainfall totals over the next five days may reach 5 to 6 inches with localized areas getting higher amounts.
The regions most impacted by the heavy rain are also slightly at risk of developing severe weather, the Lake Charles, Louisiana, the weather service office said."

The measures include giving wider access to an immediate $750 per person impacted by extreme weather, which can include storms, hurricanes, fires and tornadoes. The rules will take effect on March 22.
The overhaul of FEMA’s system comes after years of criticism that disaster survivors have to jump through hoops to access assistance that’s needed immediately. Other criticisms include inequity of who can access help, and inadequate payouts to help people rebuild damaged homes.
Deanne Criswell, who heads FEMA, told reporters on Thursday that the uptick in extreme weather called for a faster and more streamlined assistance program.
“The fact that Mother Nature is not letting up, the fact that we are breaking records year after year as disasters become deadly, more frequent, and more severe — we need to be better prepared to recover from natural disasters faster and more effectively,” Criswell said, adding that the changes were the most significant in two decades.
Criswell acknowledged criticisms of long wait times and additional red tape survivors have to navigate in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, and as they try to rebuild their homes.
“What I can tell all of you is that we can do better and that the survivors deserve better,” Criswell said.
Under the new approach, more survivors of disasters will be eligible for a one-time $750 payment, which is disbursed to help with costs like food, shelter, and evacuation, and make access to funds for home repairs easier.
FEMA will also establish a new fund for immediate housing, aimed at giving survivors flexibility on what kind of accommodation to stay in, including friends’ and relatives’ homes.
“This benefit is going to bridge the gap for those who need rental assistance and keep survivors housed in the aftermath of an event,” Criswell said.
The human-caused climate crisis is fuelling an increase in the severity and number of extreme weather events. Governments around the world are having to pour more money into disaster response.
FEMA is also stripping previous requirements making disaster survivors apply for US Small Business Administration loans before they are considered eligible for funds for personal property losses. It’s also scrapping a previous insurance cap that prevented disaster survivors getting additional assistance to help rebuild their homes.
“We are eliminating red tape, expanding eligibility, and establishing new benefits so that we can get more survivors more support,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters. “Today we are delivering for the people who most need our help, when they need it most.”
In addition, FEMA will implement several more changes to attempt to connect more people to assistance, making it easier for late applicants to get in the queue for assistance and making the appeals process easier for those who are denied. The agency is also rolling out new websites for disaster and temporary lodging that are intended to be easier for survivors to navigate.
Criswell said FEMA “took a hard look” at its assistance programs as it planned the overhaul. “We knew that there was so much more we could be doing to help survivors get the assistance that they need to get back on their feet,” she said.
The funding for the new programs will still come from the agency’s disaster relief fund, which came close to running out of money last year amid a record number of billion-dollar disasters, combined with delays in Congress passing a spending bill to replenish it.
In 2023, the US experienced 28 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least $1 billion in damage, according to a final tally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Last year saw deadly disasters, from Maui’s wildfires to historic summer floods in New England. But the costliest disaster was the drought impacting the South and Midwest, which decreased crop yields and lead to a saltwater intrusion into southern Louisiana’s water supply. The drought impacts alone cost around $14.5 billion.
The agency has found itself responding to disasters year-round. Just a few weeks into 2024, strong coastal and winter storms have not let up. A major coastal storm surge and heavy rain battered Maine, leading to historic flooding in some parts of the state – and its second such storm this year. FEMA officials are already starting to assess that storm’s damage in Maine.

Sick of the cold? Mother Nature has a change in store: A dramatic weather pattern change is coming next week that will flip the brutal cold on its head.
Few spots in the continental US have escaped the cold over the last week. Its wind chills plunged below minus 40 degrees in parts of the central US; it smashed hundreds of temperature records; it produced one of the coldest NFL games on record; and it made for the coldest Iowa caucuses ever held.
But by next week, frigid cold will be a distant memory across the mainland US as unseasonably mild conditions wipe out the chill. In some spots, it’ll feel more like March than January.
Above-average temperatures are forecast for the entire Lower 48 starting Tuesday, according to a temperature outlook from the Climate Prediction Center.
A significant shift in the weather pattern in the upper levels of the atmosphere, where the jet stream flows, is driving this change.
During the ongoing cold pattern, the jet stream – a river of air that acts as a divider between warm and cold air – has been draped across the southern tier of the US. This positioning allows bursts of cold air to race from the Arctic, rush through Canada and barrel deep into the US.
But the jet stream will be positioned farther north across the US next week. This will do two things simultaneously: trap very cold air in Canada and allow warm air from the tropics to surge northward into the US.
The warming trend will begin as early as Sunday for parts of the West and north-central US. Milder conditions will expand in scope and strength across more of the country gradually early next week.
Chicago could finally rise above freezing on Monday. It could be the first time since Saturday afternoon that thermometers in the city eclipse the 32 degree mark.
But the most drastic temperature changes from week-to-week will happen by midweek in the central and eastern US.
Parts of the Plains and Midwest will flip from temperatures 30 to 40 degrees below average last Sunday to temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average by next Wednesday.
Both Des Moines, Iowa, and Minneapolis will undergo 40- to 50-degree temperature swings from this week’s brutal cold to next week’s unseasonable warmth.
The high temperature in Des Moines on Sunday failed to climb past minus 7 degrees. By next Wednesday, a high in the upper 30s is expected – more akin to March. Minneapolis only hit 2 degrees on Sunday but will surge to a springlike high around 40 degrees next Wednesday.
It will feel more like late February farther east. Highs in the 40s will be common by midweek in Indianapolis, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York City.
And this above-average warmth is likely to persist through the end of January across much of the country, according to the Climate Prediction Center."
"The 1.5-degree climate goal may be ‘deader than a doornail,’ and scientists are bitterly divided over it",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/18/climate/paris-climate-goal-threatened-intl/index.html,"The 1.5-degree climate goal may be ‘deader than a doornail,’ and scientists are bitterly divided over it

For years, the fight against climate change has been symbolized by one number: 1.5.
Ever since countries agreed in 2015 to an ambition of restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the number has become synonymous with staving off catastrophic climate change.
But what if the battle to keep global warming from overshooting this limit has already been lost?
Some prominent scientists argue it has and it’s irresponsible to sugarcoat the truth. For others, that view is not only wrong, but even “dangerous.”
It was the renowned climate scientist James Hansen whose comments fueled the debate. In November, he declared the 1.5 degree-limit “deader than a doornail,” saying it was a shortcoming of the scientific community “to not make clear to the political leaders what the situation is.”
The rate of global warming is accelerating, he said at a news conference in November, and the world is certain to blow past 1.5 degrees of warming. “Anybody who understands the physics knows that.”
Hansen’s words have heft — he is widely credited as the first scientist to publicly sound the alarm on climate change in the 1980s. But other scientists have pushed back hard.
“I’ve got three degrees in physics, and I can tell you that Jim is wrong,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to Hansen. The problem isn’t physics, it’s politics, he told CNN. “And political obstacles can be overcome.”
The response from Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute, was even blunter. “I think that’s a very stupid thing to say,” she told reporters in November. “At the moment, (1.5 degrees) is within reach and to pretend it’s not will just lead to doing nothing even longer.”
Disagreements over climate science are not uncommon — our planet is a highly complex system, and the nature of reaching consensus typically starts with scientists who disagree.
But as global warming fuels extreme weather — like heat waves, cyclones and even fierce winter storms, such as those that have torn through parts of the United States — the debate over the future of 1.5 is getting unusually heated.
Extraordinary heat
As many parts of the US and Europe deal with an Arctic blast of brutally cold air, it can be hard to recall just how hot 2023 was. Last year saw unprecedented global temperatures, with heat records around the world tumbling.
El Niño — a natural climate phenomenon that tends to boost the planet’s average temperature — collided with the long-term trend of global warming, making 2023 the hottest year on record. The year came within a whisker of breaching 1.5 degrees, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.
While scientists are most concerned about long-term warming over many years, not just one, 2023’s record heat was a stark warning sign. If the world breaches 1.5 degrees over the long term, scientists say the impacts of climate change will start to exceed the ability of humans and ecosystems to adapt.
But every fraction of a degree matters, and climate chaos is already emerging.
“It’s not that before 1.5 everything’s fine and after 1.5 an asteroid will fall on our heads,” Otto told CNN. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees is not a physical threshold, but a political goal, she said.
Over just a few years, the world has warmed from 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels to around 1.2 degrees today — fractions of a degree that have translated to record breaking extreme weather.
For Hansen, the recent global heat offers persuasive proof that 1.5 is dead. “I have not spent much time arguing about this point… because I know that nature is in the process of proving that we are right,” he told CNN.
He predicts that by May, the planet will have experienced a 12-month period with an average temperature 1.6 to 1.7 degrees higher than pre-industrial levels.
“For all practical purposes we are only going to be looking at 1.5 degrees in the rearview mirror,” he said.
Is climate change accelerating?
At the center of Hansen’s argument is his much-debated assertion that the planet is warming much faster than predicted.
He points to the imbalance between the energy coming in from the sun and what leaves through heat radiating into space. This imbalance has doubled, meaning global warming is escalating, he argued in a November paper he co-authored with more than a dozen other scientists.
The paper’s scientists attribute this mainly to successful global efforts to tackle shipping pollution.
Ships burn fossil fuels that produce carbon emissions, which have a significant impact on global warming. But ships’ exhaust fumes also contain sulfur dioxide. In what may seem a strange twist, the pollutant – which is highly hazardous for human health – has a global cooling impact, as the particles reflect sunlight away from the Earth.
Hansen’s research predicts the world will breach the long-term 1.5-degree benchmark this decade, and 2 degrees before 2050. That would mean the world has failed to deliver on the central goal in the Paris Agreement on climate change, under which countries pledged to limit warming to well below 2 degrees.
Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of Earth sciences at University College London, shares Hansen’s concerns about the pace of change.
“The energy balance of our world is now hugely out of kilter,” McGuire told CNN, adding it’s “frankly terrifying.”
But for many other scientists, there simply isn’t the evidence to say global warming is speeding up. At least not yet.
Chris Smith, a climate modeling expert at the University of Leeds in the UK said it was too early to make the claim. “We would need three or four years of data really that all points in the same direction,” he told CNN.
Last year’s unprecedented heat was boosted by El Niño, Mann said, and “does not constitute a change in the trend line.”
The rate of global warming did accelerate after the 1970s as clean air laws reduced air pollution, but since then, “the planet has warmed at a roughly constant rate,” he said. The reality is bad enough, he added. ﻿“There is no need to exaggerate.”
Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said there have been recent climate events that scientists are struggling to understand, including 2023’s record-shattering ocean temperatures.
But in terms of Hansen’s warning about the significant impacts on global warming of cleaning up shipping pollution, “we don’t see the signal,” she said.
Why 1.5 matters
Few scientists will dispute that the world faces a daunting path to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. Even with current climate policies, the planet is on course for nearly 3 degrees of warming.
In some ways, the split between them is, at its heart, a debate about the value of having the 1.5 degree limit in the first place.
World is dangerously close to a global warming limit as 2023 goes down as hottest on record
If we say 1.5 degrees is dead, Otto said, “that means, for a lot of people, probably the conclusion is, ‘OK, then it’s not even worth trying.’”
Smith said it risks playing into a “fatalistic narrative that is actually quite dangerous,” potentially persuading leaders to think “we’ve failed, anything goes now.”
Remaining under 1.5 degrees is going to be “very difficult,” but it’s too early to say it’s impossible, he told CNN.
Mann said it was “irresponsible” to claim 1.5 degrees is dead when the world can avoid crossing the threshold by making substantial and immediate reductions in carbon pollution.
McGuire takes the opposite view. There is no feasible way the world can meet this limit which would require nearly halving emissions by 2030, he said. “To suggest otherwise is duplicitous and presents a false picture of where we are.”​ Framing 1.5 as a “target” to be reached, rather than a limit to stay under, has given the illusion we have more time than we do to tackle the crisis, he said, and has allowed countries and companies keep burning fossil fuels.
But one major concern is that if politicians abandon 1.5 degrees, they won’t strive to restrict global warming to 1.6 or 1.7 degrees, but will instead focus on 2 degrees — the upper limit countries committed to in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
“That is a huge danger, and that would really be catastrophic,” said Otto.
Between 1.5 and 2 degrees lies disaster: The risk of triggering a slew of climate tipping points, including ice sheet melting and mass coral reef death, and the lives and livelihoods of millions of people.
We will reach 1.5 degrees as a global average temperature, probably next year, Otto said. “Whether we stay there, or how much we go above that, really is still a political question and it is in our gift to change that.”"
How to stay safe and healthy during extreme cold this winter season,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/05/health/winter-weather-safety-tips-wellness-xpn/index.html,"How to stay safe and healthy during extreme cold this winter season
Follow:
Winter storms can derail our daily schedules and travel plans — but extreme cold, freezing rain, wind and snow can also affect our health.
In recent years, death rates in the United States have been 8% to 12% higher during winter months, according to mortality data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, more than 19,000 Americans have died specifically from cold-related causes since 1979, according to death certificates.
This increase is linked to “seasonal changes in behavior and the human body” and “increased exposure to respiratory diseases,” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
On top of preparing your home and car for winter weather, there are steps you can take to keep yourself and others healthy when it’s very cold.
Caring for children and the elderly
Infants and older adults should be top of mind during a winter storm, says Dr. Tyler Barrett, executive medical director of emergency services at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville.
Who will see snow this weekend? First big winter storm of the season targets Northeast and mid-Atlantic
“Infants and older adults have a harder time maintaining their core body temperatures,” he said, because babies lose body heat more easily and older adults tend to make less body heat. Hypothermia happens when your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced.
Make sure any children younger than 1 are sleeping in warm rooms, ideally between 68 and 72 degrees. Similarly, if you have friends or neighbors older than 65, check on them frequently to ensure that their homes are adequately heated.
Barrett also notes the risk for hypothermia goes up once the temperature inside a home goes below 50 degrees for a prolonged period of time.
Try to keep pets indoors during cold weather, but if they go outside, thoroughly wipe their legs and underbelly free of snow when they come in.
Staying safe indoors
What you should have in stock when preparing for a winter storm
Never use generators, gas or charcoal grills or wood stove inside your home. The fumes from these devices can cause carbon monoxide to build up, Barrett adds, and the odorless and colorless gas can kill you.
“If you are running any sort of heater, always be cognizant of carbon monoxide and have a carbon monoxide detector in your house,” he said.
Using the kitchen stove for heat is also not safe, the CDC warns; instead, use extra blankets, sleeping bags or coats. A well-maintained fireplace or a portable space heater may be a safer alternative.
Staying safe outdoors
Avoid traveling on ice-covered roads if possible. If you’re stranded outdoors and have a vehicle, it’s safest to stay inside it to prevent hypothermia, the National Weather Service says.
If you have to shovel snow or do other outdoor work, take your time and work slowly. Avoid walking on ice and getting wet.
Travel in pairs and keep an emergency kit nearby, as well as a cell phone, when you’re participating in outdoor recreation like skiing, sledding, or going for a run.
Dangers of frostbite and hypothermia
If you need to venture out during a winter storm, Barrett recommends limiting the amount of time you spend outside to prevent frostbite or hypothermia.
Frostbite can strike quickly. Here’s what you need to know
“Dress in warm, dry layers with a special emphasis on protecting those more sensitive areas like your ears, your nose, your cheeks, your toes, your fingers,” he said. “Those are the areas that are at increased risk of developing frostbite.”
Frostbite can happen in freezing temperatures when your blood vessels narrow, skin temperature drops and ice crystals form around and within your cells, causing damage. Symptoms include white or grayish-yellow skin that feels unusually firm and numbness in the affected area.
If you or someone you know develops frostbite and immediate medical care is not available, the CDC recommends getting into a warm room as soon as possible and immersing the affected area in warm — not hot — water. You can also warm the affected area using body heat.
Hypothermia is a more serious medical condition that requires emergency medical assistance, the CDC says. Someone with hypothermia may be shivering excessively or have skin that is bright red and cold. Other signs include confusion, memory loss, slurred speech and drowsiness.
If you can’t get to a hospital right away, find a warm room or shelter and remove any wet clothing.
Warm the center of the body first – chest, neck and head – with skin-to-skin contact under loose, dry layers. Warm beverages can also help increase body temperature.
Staying moisturized
In extremely cold temperatures, our skin can become very dry and cracked if not moisturized properly.
The Northeast and mid-Atlantic are in for an icy, snowy weekend as winter storm looms
“You do have increased risk for developing skin infections,” Barrett said. “We all have bacteria that live on our skin, and your skin serves as a barrier, keeping that bacteria from infecting you, so if you do get dry cracked skin, you are at some slightly increased risk.”
Use warm water instead of hot water during baths and showers to prevent dry skin from worsening.
The American Academy of Dermatology recommends applying moisturizer immediately after you shower to trap existing moisture in your skin. An ointment or cream could be more beneficial than lotions with heavy perfumes or scents.
“People who suffer from eczema may get some increased flares during wintertime,” Barrett said, adding that those with winter-related skin conditions should talk to their primary care provider for further guidance and treatment.
Extreme cold and the lungs
Colder, drier air can cause complications for people with respiratory illnesses like the flu, Covid-19 and RSV, Barrett says, by irritating the airways and causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath.
The year’s most extreme weather shows what a warming planet is capable of, and what’s to come
Annual vaccinations are important, especially those for flu and Covid-19, to help prevent these complications. The flu shot has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%, according to the CDC.
People with lung diseases such as asthma are also at risk of complications from cold weather because of inflammation in their lungs.
“If you do have asthma and you’re going to be outside, try to limit breathing in that cold air, whether that’s wearing a scarf or just limiting your time outside,” Barrett said. People with asthma should also keep a rescue inhaler on them at all times.
If you cannot breathe due to extreme cold, whether from a respiratory illness or asthma, he advises going to the emergency room right away.
Cardiovascular risks
Frosty weather can affect your heart, especially if you have cardiovascular disease, by narrowing the blood vessels. That can put stress on your heart.

“Snow shoveling is one example where we see people who have heart disease, or risk factors for heart disease, exerting themselves more than they may otherwise,” Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and an emergency department physician, told CNN previously.
A drop in temperature by 33 degrees Fahrenheit was associated with a cumulative 2% increased risk of heart attack in a 2010 study published in the BMJ.
People who have a heart condition or even high blood pressure should avoid strenuous activities like shoveling or exercising too much."

As wintry weather whips across the United States, one challenge may be staying warm if you can’t afford or are cutting back on indoor heating.
Staying warm is necessary “for a variety of health reasons” in addition to comfort, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association. For people with arthritis, stiffness “in your back and neck and sore joints do occur more in colder weather. … People who have metabolic conditions can be sensitive to the weather, like diabetes, for example, and heart disease. The more cold you are, the more stress you put on your heart.”
A little savvy based on our warm-blooded bodies, food, appliances, furniture, the outdoor elements and more can go a long way. Here are 25 ways to stay warm this winter — with or without indoor heating — that won’t break the bank.
How to warm your body
1. Warm up with store-bought hand warmers, microwavable heating pads, hot water bottles or heated blankets. Following the manufacturer’s instructions and concentrating on your torso are key, said JohnEric Smith, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology at Mississippi State University. “If you warm the core you can warm the hands and feet. It is harder to warm the core by warming the hands and feet.”
Be careful that you don’t burn yourself, Benjamin said. “They’re very effective on a knee or shoulder or the back of the neck. … You rarely put it directly on your skin. You usually wrap it in something, maybe a thin towel.”
2. Move your body. Physical activities like indoor exercise or dancing can help you warm up, but don’t get to the point where you’re sweating, Smith said. “We sweat to lose heat and sweating will make us colder.”
3. Think twice about taking a warm shower or bath. “While a warm bath or shower will feel good for the minute,” Smith said, “you will be cold after you get out and your wet skin is losing heat more quickly.”
4. Cuddle. Snuggles really can keep you warm. “Each of us produces heat through our metabolic processes. We lose our heat to the environment as we maintain body temperature,” Smith said via email. “Increasing skin contact decreases opportunities for the heat to be lost to the environment around us. If two people are under a blanket both of their heat losses combined can increase the temperature under the blanket more quickly than either could do independently.”
5. Change how you perceive cold. Some people have trained their minds to perceive cold as an objective, acceptable sensation rather than something dreadful to control. The best ways to adapt include wearing clothing in layers then removing it, or gradually lowering the thermostat and putting on a sweater, Benjamin said.
Warmth that’s comforting
6. Enjoy warm beverages and foods, and use the oven and stove to cook them. Since foods higher in fat and protein are metabolized slowly by the body, those could make you feel warmer, Smith said. “Consider hearty soups with beans and meat.” Slow cooking meals can help generate heat throughout the day.
Drinking warm beverages “certainly helps take the chill off,” Benjamin said. Leaving the oven or stove on is “a bad idea because it burns fuel,” Benjamin said, “but more importantly, people fall asleep, they forget and leave the stove on. Sometimes things on the stove can catch on fire. So like any tool, you should use it for the purpose in which it was designed.”
“It only has to go poorly once to be life changing,” Smith said. If you don’t have children or pets, when you’re done cooking and you turn off the oven, what doesn’t hurt is leaving the oven door open to let residual heat escape.
How to dress for the cold
7. Layer on the clothes. “Layering is critical,” Smith said. “Even thin layers added together to increase one’s ability to retain heat … focus on keeping the torso warm. Often an extra shirt or vest can warm your hands and feet more than an extra pair of socks or gloves.” Inexpensive pairs of tights or long johns can be worn underneath clothes. However, be sure that layering doesn’t make your clothing tight, he added, since that could reduce blood flow and thus your body’s ability to get warm blood to those areas. Wearing a hat, too, can also keep the heat in.
8. Wear thick socks and slippers. Fuzzy socks, slippers or a pair of shoes you reserve for wearing around the house can add extra comfort.
9. Pile on the blankets. “The more layers you put on, the better it helps trap the air between you,” your sheets and your blankets, Benjamin said. Since you lose a lot of heat from your head while you’re under blankets, he added, wearing a skull cap can help also.
10. Embrace less breathable clothing and linens. Breathable linens (such as the cotton-based variety) are often recommended during the summer, but linens with other materials and higher thread counts may be better for winter since higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.
Optimize your home and appliances
11. Work with the weather. Open your curtains or blinds to let the sun in during the day, or when outside is warmer than inside your home.
12. Seal your windows and doors. Even if your windows and doors are totally shut and locked, drafts can seep in through small crevices. You can use caulk or shrink film to seal those cracks. Placing inexpensive, transparent shower curtains over windows can keep the sun in but the cold draft out. For the bottoms of doors, cloth draft stoppers are “very effective,” Benjamin said.
13. Close off unoccupied rooms. By shutting the doors of rooms no one is using, you can create additional barriers between yourself and the cold outdoors. This can also aid preventing heat loss from the room you’re in.
14. Reverse your ceiling fan. If possible, send your ceiling fan in a clockwise direction so that it sends the warm air down.
15. Sit near indoor heaters. You can safely use portable heaters if they are space heaters that have automatic shutoffs and can be plugged into a wall outlet instead of an extension cord. Since space heaters are a common cause of fires, they should be at least 3 feet away from any drapes, bedding or furniture. To prevent high levels of carbon monoxide — which can cause potentially fatal poisoning — ensure you have a carbon monoxide monitor installed and that you don’t “use any type of outdoor gas heater or anything that is not electric,” Benjamin said.
16. Move anything that’s blocking heat vents or radiators. The heat will better circulate throughout your home that way.
17. Spend time and sleep in the upper levels of the house. Heat rises, so moving your working, sleeping and living spaces upward may be more comfortable.
18. After showering, don’t run the bathroom fan or close the door. Unless your bathroom is prone to growing humidity-induced mold, the warm steam from the shower can make the nearby air less dry and cool for a short period of time.
19. Buy magnetic vent covers from home improvement stores. Used to cover vents, they can be inexpensive and help to force heat to exit vents in the occupied rooms only.
20. Put down rugs or carpets. These can be warmer to the touch than bare floors.
21. Insulate your attic. If you can afford to, padding your attic with insulation from hardware stores can help to retain some of the heat you usually lose through the attic since heat rises.
22. Research what your residential area offers. Some locations may be running warming centers set up for safety during the pandemic.
Cozy up near the elements
23. Light a fire. If your fireplace runs on wood instead of gas, a fire is another way to keep a room warm and enjoy a cozy night. “Make sure that your flue is properly opened and clean to make sure that smoke doesn’t come back in the home but goes properly up the flue,” Benjamin said. “When the fire is out, you should of course close the flue because it’s like having an open window.”
24. Keep warm and enjoy s’mores. If your state, city, county or neighborhood allows, have a (moderate-size) backyard bonfire to keep warm for a while.
25. Don’t light candles. Candles can emit a small amount of heat, but using them as a source of warmth can be dangerous. “People will light candles and go to sleep, and they fall over,” Benjamin said. “The cat comes in and kicks it over and starts a fire.”
With these tips in mind and any others you find, be “broadly thoughtful about how to stay warm in the winter,” he added. “If it sounds like it’s a bad idea, it probably is. Look it up and check it out before you do it.”

Follow:
If you’ve been on YouTube lately, you might have come across someone claiming wind and solar energy don’t work, that rising sea levels will help coral reefs flourish, or that climate scientists are corrupt and alarmist.
These are all false and misleading statements taken from a handful of thousands of YouTube videos analyzed by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which has identified a stark change in the tactics of climate deniers over the past few years.
Where once climate deniers would outright reject climate change as a hoax or scam, or claim that humans were not responsible for it, many are now shifting to a different approach, one which attempts to undermine climate science, cast doubt on climate solutions and even claim global warming will be beneficial at best, harmless at worst.
The past five years have seen a “startling” rise in this “new denial,” according to a CCDH analysis published Tuesday, which also suggests this shift in narrative could also be helping YouTube video creators circumvent the social media company’s ban on monetizing climate denial.
Researchers gathered transcripts from more than 12,000 videos posted between 2018 and 2023 across 96 YouTube channels that have promoted climate denial and misinformation. Transcripts were analyzed by artificial intelligence to categorize the climate denial narratives used as either “old denial” or “new denial.”
“New denial” content — attacks on solutions, the science and the climate movement — now makes up 70% of all climate denial claims posted on YouTube, according to the report, up from 35% in 2018.
Assertions that “global warming is not happening,” one of the main “old denial” claims the analysis focused on, declined from 48% of all denial claims in 2018 to 14% in 2023, the report found. Claims that climate solutions won’t work, however, soared from 9% to 30% over the same period.
‘Murderers’ and ‘criminals’: Meteorologists face unprecedented harassment from conspiracy theorists
Imran Ahmed, chief executive officer and founder of CCDH, said the report in some ways is a story of success.
“The climate movement has won the argument that climate change is real, and that it is hurting our planet’s ecosystems,” he told CNN. As the impacts of the climate crisis — from scorching heat waves to fierce storms — affect a broader swath of the global population, narratives that deny the existence of climate change are becoming less effective.
But, he added, it’s also a huge warning. “Now that the majority of people recognize old climate denial as counterfactual and discredited, climate deniers have cynically concluded that the only way to derail climate action is to tell people the solutions don’t work.”
“This new climate denial is no less insidious,” Ahmed said, “and it could hold enormous influence over public opinion on climate action for decades to come.”
It’s particularly worrying because of the young demographic attracted to YouTube, according to the CCDH. A December survey from Pew Research Center found YouTube to be the most widely used social media platform it analyzed among 13- to 17-year olds, used by roughly nine in 10 of them.
“Climate deniers now have access to vast global audiences through digital platforms,” Charlie Cray, senior strategist at Greenpeace, said in a statement. “Allowing them to steadily chip away at public support for climate action — especially among younger viewers — could have devastating consequences for the future of our planet.”
The shift in tactics to undermine climate action could also help creators get around YouTube’s policy banning them from making money on climate denial content, the report suggests. In 2021, the company prohibited advertising against content that “contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.”
Yet YouTube is potentially making up to $13.4 million a year from ads on videos the report found to contain climate denial, according to the CCDH’s calculations, including ads from prominent sportswear companies, hotels and international nonprofits.
“There aren’t many companies that would be happy about seeing their advertising appear next to clear climate denial content,” Ahmed said. “And I imagine they will be furious to find out that they are inadvertently funding climate denial content.”
In a statement to CNN, a YouTube spokesperson said, “debate or discussions of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed.”
However, the spokesperson added, “when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing ads on those videos. We also display information panels under relevant videos to provide additional information on climate change and context from third parties.”
YouTube said its enforcement teams work quickly to review videos that may potentially violate policies, then act on them.
‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war
The company said that after reviewing the CCDH report, it found some of the videos included did violate existing climate change policies and has since removed ads from them. However, it also said the majority of the videos in the analysis did not breach their policies.
Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the narrative shift in climate denial, said the findings were “disturbing.”
“It is extremely unlikely that this is the result of organic social media activity,” Mann, who was not involved in the study, told CNN. “It suggests that bad actors have made a concerted effort to weaponize social media in a way that is especially targeted toward young people, recognizing that they are the greatest threat to the fossil fuel industry status quo, as evidenced by the tremendous impact of the youth climate movement.”
Ahmed called on Google to boost its policies to deal with “new denial” content. “We’re asking Google to extend their ban on monetization and amplification of ‘old denial’ content to include ‘new denial’ as well,” Ahmed said, adding that other social media companies should also take note of the report’s findings.
“We’re asking other platforms that claim to be green in one breath not to profit from, to revenue share, and therefore, reward or to amplify clear climate denial content that contradicts scientific consensus,” Ahmed added. “You can’t claim to be green but then be the world’s biggest megaphone for climate change-related disinformation.”

UK government approves controversial $2.5B project for ‘carbon negative’ power plant,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/climate/drax-biomass-beccs-carbon-negative-climate-intl/index.html,"UK government approves controversial $2.5B project for ‘carbon negative’ power plant
Follow:
The UK government approved a £2 billion (around $2.5 billion) project on Tuesday to create a “carbon negative” wood-burning power plant. But some climate experts say it’s a costly experiment for a technology that may not be green.
Energy secretary Claire Coutinho’s decision greenlights a plan to bolt carbon capture units onto two generators at a power station in Yorkshire, northern England, run by Drax. Once operational, each would be capable of preventing 4 million tons of carbon pollution a year from entering the atmosphere, according to the company.
The carbon would then be stored under the North Sea, with the aim of preventing it from adding to global warming.
Once the most polluting power station in western Europe, Drax switched from burning coal to burning biomass — mostly wood pellets — in 2019. The power station in Yorkshire, which produces around 4% of the UK’s power, mostly burns wood imported from North America.
Biomass is already considered carbon neutral because even though carbon pollution is released when trees are burned, the idea is emissions are offset by the growth of new trees to replace those burned, which suck up carbon through photosynthesis as they grow.
Adding carbon capture units will convert the plant to a form of energy called “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage,” or BECCS, which Drax says will allow it to remove more carbon pollution from the atmosphere than it is produced by burning the biomass, making it carbon negative.
What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it’s a dangerous distraction
But the technology has been heavily criticized by some climate experts.
“BECCS is an unproven and highly controversial technology that would come at significant financial cost to the UK public,” said Tomos Harrison, electricity transition analyst at energy think tank Ember.
Some scientists have cast doubt on the climate credentials of burning biomass. A 2021 study from the European Academies Science Advisory Council concluded that burning wood for energy “is not effective in mitigating climate change and may even increase the risk of dangerous climate change.”
A main criticism is that it takes decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be reabsorbed by new trees and plants as they grow.
There are also concerns that wood sourcing may be damaging to forests.
Last May, following a BBC investigation which alleged some of Drax’s wood came from mature forests in Canada, the UK energy regulator Ofgem launched an investigation into Drax over whether it had breached sustainability requirements in relation to the wood pellets it was burning.
In response to Ofgem’s investigation, which is still ongoing, Drax said at the time it was confident in its compliance, and added that in 2022 the company had appointed a third party to “independently verify the accuracy of its biomass sustainability.” Drax has said it only uses wood from sustainable sources.
Some experts believe money would be better spent on other renewable technology.
Laith Whitwham, senior policy advisor at climate think tank E3G, said the renewable status of burning wood pellets remains “hotly contested” and Drax’s project was a distraction from where investment was most needed.
“Public money would be better spent on increasing grid capacity and battery storage, and further expanding wind and solar generation,” he told CNN.
Drax has received an average of around £785 million ($620 million) a year in government subsidies, according to Ember research.
“BECCS is an expensive gamble,” concludes an Ember report published Tuesday, which calculated that the project could cost taxpayers up to £1.7 billion a year.
A spokesperson for Drax said Ember’s report “veers between factual inaccuracies and a series of misguided assumptions.”
In its own analysis published Tuesday, Drax said the development of BECCs at its power station would lead to savings of around £15 billion ($19 billion) for the UK.
BECCS “offers the most cost-effective, straightforward and efficient way to help the country meet climate targets and could save billions of pounds, remove millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere and support the UK’s energy security,” Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said in a statement Tuesaday.
Gardiner called the government’s decision “another milestone” in the development of BECCs. He said it demonstrated the “critical role” Drax could have in “delivering large-scale carbon dioxide removals.”
In its decision letter, the UK government said the project would “make a meaningful contribution to meeting the urgent need for carbon capture storage infrastructure to support the transition to Net Zero by 2050.”"
Northwest faces freezing rain and heavy snow while Arctic blast loosens its grip on eastern US,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/weather/winter-storm-snow-pacific-northwest-wednesday/index.html,"At least 40 dead from barrage of winter storms and cold – and there’s more on the way
Follow:
An unrelenting series of winter storms and an outbreak of cold air have killed multiple people across several states since Friday. Now, another round of extreme cold and snow will march across the central and eastern US, setting up more hazardous travel and a brutally cold weekend. Here’s the latest:
• More than three dozen storm-related deaths: At least 40 people have died across nine states since January 12. Fatalities have been reported in Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin. In Tennessee, where the highest number of weather-related deaths was reported so far, a box truck driver was killed Monday evening when he lost control of the vehicle on a snowy Knoxville highway and careened into a tractor-trailer, police said. Fourteen people were killed across Tenessee due to the severe weather, the state’s emergency management agency said Wednesday, citing the state department of health. Five people died in Pennsylvania when their minivan lost control on a snow-covered I-81, the coroner’s office in Lackawanna County said.
• Another round of snow and cold coming: More accumulating snow is likely from the Midwest to the East on Friday. Light totals could once again blanket Washington, DC, and New York City soon after their nearly two-year wait for an inch of snow ended early this week. In the South, winter weather alerts are also in effect across Nashville, Lexington and Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday. Read on for a more detailed forecast.
• Ice knocks out power, creates treacherous travel in Northwest: Freezing rain and wind pelting the Pacific Northwest knocked out power to more than 85,000 homes and businesses in Oregon Wednesday morning amid frigid temperatures. By Wednesday evening, power outages in Oregon had dropped below 50,000. Icy roadways and downed trees and power lines created dangerous travel conditions that triggered road closures Tuesday night and Wednesday. A nearly 50 mile-stretch of I-84 from west of Portland to the eastern side of the Oregon Cascades was shut down Tuesday night due to the ice threat, according to the state’s department of transportation. That portion remained closed Wednesday evening due to unsafe conditions, and it’s unclear when it will reopen, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said.
• Buffalo, New York, drivers face snowy conditions: Lake-effect snow warnings are in effect until Thursday night in Buffalo, where additional snow accumulations of 9 to 18 inches are possible in some areas. The surrounding area could see 1 to 3 feet of localized snowfall and wind gusts up to 40 mph. More than 30 inches of snow had fallen south of Buffalo in Lackawanna, New York, as of Wednesday morning. “Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas of blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will impact the morning commute,” the weather service warned. “Bitter wind chills as low as 10 below zero could result in hypothermia if precautions are not taken.”
Harsh cold and snow to return
Relief from the cold will be short-lived with another push of bone-chilling air set to arrive across the north-central US late Thursday. The abnormal cold will rush across much of the central and eastern US by Friday afternoon and remain in place for most of the weekend.
High temperatures will struggle to reach the freezing mark in Oklahoma City, Nashville, Philadelphia and New York City on Friday. Chicago won’t be able to break out of the teens and Minneapolis will be stuck in the single digits Friday as the harsh cold settles into place.
Wind chills across the central US will plunge back to dangerous levels by Friday, increasing the risk for frostbite and hypothermia.
Another round of snow will overspread portions of the Midwest and East on Friday as two pieces of atmospheric energy – one of which can be traced back to the Northwest storm – collide. Snow will begin as early as Thursday night in Chicago, and by Friday morning, accumulating snow will stretch into the interior Northeast and central Appalachians.
Cities in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that just ended record-long snow droughts from an early week storm, including Washington, DC, New York and Philadelphia, will once again have the chance for a light-to-moderate snow.
Around 1 to 3 inches of snow are likely from the Midwest to the East, but some parts of the Appalachians may see totals closer to half a foot by the time snow ends Friday night.
Despite low snowfall amounts, the combination of snow and breezy winds could lead to tricky travel. Additional cancellations and delays are also possible, especially after schools and government offices were shuttered by the similarly impactful early-week storm.
Double whammy of ice and snow in Northwest
Back-to-back storms are delivering a deadly “1-2 punch” to the Northwest with freezing rain and ice in Oregon and Washington and heavy snow through the region’s interior through the end of the week, the weather service said.
At least seven people died in the Portland, Oregon, area since Friday from severe winter weather. Four hypothermia deaths are being investigated in Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland, county officials told CNN.
Millions in the region were under ice storm warnings early Wednesday, including hard-hit Portland, after a new storm moved onshore Tuesday night. As the severe weather threat persists, Portland Public Schools plan to close Thursday for the third day, the district announced.
Ice and wind combined to bring down trees across the Portland area with deadly effect. A tree came crashing down on an elderly man who was asleep on the second floor of his home, killing him, in Lake Oswego, Oregon, fire marshal Gert Zoutendijk told CNN.
“I don’t have enough words to describe what that looked like,” Lake Oswego Police Chief George Burke said during an emergency city council meeting Tuesday.
Winter storm warnings also extend over the Cascades and northern Rockies. Up to 3 feet of snow could fall over the Cascades through Thursday afternoon and up to 2 feet is possible in higher elevation areas in the northern parts of Washington, Idaho and Montana by late Thursday morning.

A brutal Arctic blast is bringing record-low temperatures and life-threatening wind chills across a large swath of the United States as snow and ice spread from the South to New England and a new storm targets the Northwest with dangerous ice. Here’s the latest:
• Record snowless streaks end: Enough snow fell in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, to end nearly 2-year-long waits for an inch of snow there. The cities all recorded at least an inch of snow in 24 hours, something that hadn’t been done in more than 700 days in all the locations. The streaks were record-long in Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia and the DC area’s Dulles International Airport.
• Record-breaking cold temperatures: Nearly 80% of the US will see below-freezing temperatures over the next week as another shot of cold air spreads across the country by late week. Numerous daily cold records have already been set – including across Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. It snowed as far south as Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, on Tuesday morning, and while there was no accumulation, both cities reported rare snowfall for a few hours. Hundreds of Alabama National Guardsmen jumped into action to assist motorists and clear vehicles on Interstate 65. Hard freeze warnings are expected Tuesday evening for much of the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida. Temperatures in Memphis, Dallas and Nashville are expected to stay below freezing for at least 72 consecutive hours.
• Frostbite can happen in minutes: Much of the Rockies, Great Plains and Midwest will see life-threatening sub-zero wind chills into Wednesday, with wind chills as low as minus 30 degrees over the Northern Plains. “These wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in a few minutes and hypothermia shortly thereafter,” the National Weather Service warned.
• At least 12 deaths across several states: Deaths have been reported across Arkansas, Oregon, Mississippi, Kansas and Tennessee since January 12 as back-to-back winter storms have pummeled the US with dangerous wind, ice and snow. One person was killed and another was injured in Arkansas after their pickup truck careened off a snowy White County highway and hit a tree, according to state police.
• Icy roads make travel dangerous: Wintry conditions were reported on roads in at least a half-dozen southern states Tuesday morning. Crashes on a slick I-10 in southern Louisiana closed an expansive stretch of the highway in both directions Tuesday morning. Transportation departments across the region urged people to stay home and off roads as they tried to combat the conditions. “Hundreds” of travel incidents unfolded on Tennessee roads Monday, the state’s DOT said.
• 10,000 flights cancelled: The transportation toll from a hyperactive stretch of winter weather goes beyond roads. More than 10,000 flights have been cancelled since Friday, FlightAware data shows. Most cancellations Tuesday were in the East because of the active storm, but the flight issues stretch as far west as Denver.
• Schools and government offices are closed: School districts in more than half a dozen states, including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and West Virginia announced closures amid the frigid temperatures. Federal government offices closed in Washington, DC, for the first time since Jan. 7, 2022 because of the weather.
Snow and freezing rain sweep into Northeast
As dangerously cold temperatures continue across much of the US – with more than 95 million people in 35-plus states under winter weather alerts – snow and freezing rain over the South spread into the mid-Atlantic, Northeast and New England through Tuesday.
Downwind of the Great Lakes, heavy lake effect snowfall is expected to stir up some significant travel headaches. Lake Effect snow happens when cold air moves across the open, unfrozen waters of the Great Lakes, creating narrow bands that produce 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more.
Buffalo, New York, is under a lake effect snow warning from Tuesday afternoon through Thursday evening, with heavy lake effect snowfall of 1 to 3 feet and gusts to 40 mph possible. Watertown, also under a winter storm watch through early Friday, could see heavy lake effect snowfall of 2 to 3 feet possible.
“Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility,” the National Weather Service office in Buffalo warned. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning and evening commute.”
Chicago scrambles to shelter migrants in dangerous cold as Texas’ governor refuses to stop drop-offs
This region had just received over 3 feet of snowfall from a previous round of very heavy lake effect snowfall.
New York City received 1.6 inches of snow after not getting an inch of snow fall in a single day in more than 700 days.
Washington, DC, received 4.1 inches of snow from the storm, ending the city’s streak without at least an inch of snow in 728 days.
Philadelphia also broke its snow drought with 1.5 inches falling as of early Tuesday after 715 days of not seeing an inch of snowfall.
As the Northeast deals with snow, another storm will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest from Tuesday into Wednesday as the region continues recovering from a damaging storm that hit late last week.
An ice storm warning is in place for over 3 million people across the region, including Portland, with freezing rain set to arrive there in the late afternoon, close to the evening commute. Enough ice could accumulate to cause damage to trees and power lines, threatening power outages. The city’s school district said all public schools will be closed Wednesday due to the ongoing ice storm. The system will also bring rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest into California, with snow over higher elevations.
Sub-zero wind chills
Temperatures are expected to moderate Wednesday before a new surge of cold air will arrive over the northern Plains and Midwest and the Deep South by the end of the week, according to the weather service.
Wind chill temperatures – how cold the air feels on exposed skin – are expected to remain at hazardous lows that cause frostbite and hypothermia.
Dangerously cold wind chills as low as 30 below zero are expected in North Dakota and other parts of the Northern Plains Wednesday. Subzero wind chills will spread as far east as New England and as far south as Mississippi.
“Avoid outdoor activities if possible. If you must be outside, wear appropriate clothing, dress in layers, and cover exposed skin. Keep pets indoors,” the National Weather Service said. “Have a cold survival kit if you must travel.”

Why we still have brutal cold snaps even as the planet warms to record levels,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/climate/why-extreme-cold-during-global-warming/index.html,"Why we still have brutal cold snaps even as the planet warms to record levels
Follow:
After a summer of record-breaking heat, vast swaths of the United States are now grappling with extreme cold as a brutal Arctic blast brings snow squalls, deadly ice and life-threatening wind chills.
As unprecedented heat makes way for cold, it can provide fuel for climate-change deniers who point to freezing temperatures as evidence that global warming is overstated.
But scientists are clear: cold extremes will still occur even as winters warm overall.
Global heat records outpace cold records — 2023 was the hottest year on record by a huge margin. And even as the US struggles to cope with intense bursts of heavy snow now, over the long term, the human-caused climate crisis has led to an alarming trend of disappearing snow in the Northern Hemisphere.
Some scientists say that climate change may even be playing a role in these icy blasts, as warming in the Arctic increases the likelihood that frigid, polar air can sweep southwards.
What explains the cold?
Our weather is heavily influenced by the jet stream, a wavy river of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere.
When the jet stream swings south, it can push cold Arctic air into North America, Europe and Asia. When it retreats north, warm air will also push further north.  A big high-pressure swing over Europe last January led to record warm winter temperatures.
There’s also another factor to consider: the polar vortex, a belt of strong winds which sits extremely high in the stratosphere – above the level of the jet stream – around the North Pole.
The polar vortex is like a spinning top. In its normal state it rotates very fast, keeping blisteringly cold air locked in the Arctic region. But it can get disrupted and knocked off course, becoming stretched and distorted, spilling out cold air and influencing the path of the jet stream.
It happened in 2021, bringing fierce cold to Texas, leading to nearly 250 deaths and knocking out power to large parts of the state.
This is where the link to climate change comes in. Some scientists believe polar vortex disruptions and changes to the jet stream are being driven by warming in the Arctic, which is heating up around four times faster than the rest of the planet.
The idea has been gaining traction since a 2012 paper by Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. It found that as the Arctic warms, the difference between the cold temperatures in the north and warm temperatures in the south is leading to a weaker, wavier jet stream, which pushes very cold air southwards.
Her much-debated paper kicked off more research into this developing area of science.
In 2021, Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published research which found rapid heating in parts of the Arctic, combined with high snowfall in Siberia, was making the jet stream more wavy and knocked the polar vortex off course.
“We are not arguing that winters are getting colder overall,” Cohen told CNN last year. But the idea that climate change will mean fewer swings between extreme temperatures is “an oversimplification,” he said.
The area of science remains very unsettled, however, and others have said the links between Arctic warming and cold snaps are far from clear.
While there have been a number of very cold Northern Hemisphere winters coinciding with warm Arctic winters, the difficulty is unpicking cause from effect, said James Screen, professor in climate science at Exeter University, whose own research concluded Arctic warming is not a trigger for colder winters.
Extreme cold snaps can be explained by normal climate variability, said Screen. In other words, even as winters get warmer, cold extremes will still occur.
And climate change can also influence the severity of winter storms, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture leading to more intense rain or snow when it falls.
As scientists work to unravel complex links between climate change and periods of intense cold, all agree on one thing: the trend is for warmer winters.
“If you look at the data, we see that over the long term, global warming is leading to fewer and less severe cold extremes,” Screen said.

An ongoing arctic blast enveloping much of the US will set the stage for impactful snow and ice to fall in parts of the South for the first time this winter as a new storm tracks through the region.
The South storm will be the fourth in the last two weeks to threaten major impacts to areas east of the Rockies as a frenetic start to 2024 shows no signs of stopping.
Damaging ice and wind combined with deadly results in Oregon Saturday. On Sunday, serious lake-effect snow was ongoing in Buffalo, New York; blinding snow squalls were possible across the Northeast; and strong winds were still kicking up snow and affecting travel in the Midwest.
But in the warmer South, it’s been all tornadoes and severe thunderstorms with past storms. That’s all set to change as the arctic chill settles over the region and much of the country.
More than 75% of the US population will experience temperatures below freezing over the next seven days. Just through Tuesday, more than 250 daily cold temperature records could be broken from Oregon to Mississippi. The cold will make for the coldest Iowa caucuses on record Monday, with below zero high temperatures and wind chills in the minus 30s forecast.
People in Dallas, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, woke up to temperatures in the teens Sunday. By Tuesday, those same temperatures arrive for Atlanta, Montgomery, Alabama and Shreveport, Louisiana.
In southern cities such as Memphis, Dallas and Nashville, temperatures are expected to remain below freezing for at least 72 consecutive hours. The prolonged cold could lead to “damage to exposed pipes and water main breaks are expected,” warned the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Mississippi.
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a state of emergency starting Sunday, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
“All Mississippians in the impacted areas are encouraged to take precautions over the next few days. Prepare your homes now for below-freezing temperatures, bring pets inside, and check in with your loved ones who are most susceptible during this frigid weather,” the release said.
The extreme cold will also test Texas’s notoriously vulnerable-to-extreme-temperatures power grid for the first time this winter. The plummeting temperatures will increase power demand on the grid enough that the state’s independent grid operator, ERCOT, issued a weather watch, warning of the impending surge in demand and a potential dip in reserves.
ERCOT said there was expected to be enough power to avoid outages. However, the agency asked Texans to conserve electricity use Monday as it “expects tight grid conditions.”
A wind chill as low as minus 71 degrees was reported in Montana Saturday. It won’t feel that cold in the South, but winds of 10 to 25 mph could cause life-threatening wind chills that could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.
With the cold air in place, a new system will move out of the Rockies and into the southern Plains bringing snow, sleet and freezing rain from Texas to Virginia.
Winter storm alerts stretch from Texas to Virginia and encompass more than 45 million people, including all of Tennessee and Arkansas.
“The prolonged nature of this event could result in moderate to major potential winter storm impacts over parts of Arkansas, northwest Mississippi and western Tennessee,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Winter weather conditions impact flights nationwide for third consecutive day
The warnings aren’t limited to the South: On Sunday, the National Weather Service announced a snow squall warning for the city of Philadelphia. The service warned of “intense bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling visibility” and said “travel will become difficult to potentially dangerous within minutes.”
The New York City Emergency Management Department issued a Weather Alert for Sunday, warning of an arctic cold front expected to sweep through the region in the early afternoon.
The snow squall threat had ended for New York City by late Sunday afternoon, according to emergency management, though a few flurries remained possible Sunday night with light snow expected into Tuesday, the agency said on X.
States of emergency were declared in both Arkansas and Louisiana ahead of the system to prepare for its arrival.
Ice is one of the biggest concerns. A strip of sleet and freezing rain is expected from San Angelo, Texas, to Huntsville, Alabama. Hazardous ice could build up on roadways, trees and power lines.
And because of the cold, the slick wintry precipitation won’t melt on untreated surfaces for the Monday morning commute in places like Dallas and Shreveport, Louisiana, making travel more dangerous.
Dallas is expected to see a combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow from 3 p.m. Sunday through 9 a.m. Monday. The timing will skew a few hours later in points to the east.
The storm will lay down a coating of snow between 2 and 6 inches from Oklahoma to Virginia, just north of where the heaviest ice will fall.
Memphis, which has had no measurable snow so far this year, is forecast to see between 3 and 7 inches. The threat here begins late Sunday and continues through Monday overnight.
Snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are also expected from Oklahoma City through Tulsa. Nearly the entire state of Arkansas is expected to see at least 3 inches, with some locations picking up as much as 6 inches total. Snowfall accumulations of 3 to 5 inches are expected for Nashville and Knoxville, Tennessee.
The storm will clear the South by late Tuesday and could then track into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, increasing snow chances there by Wednesday.

US climate envoy John Kerry plans to step down from his post by this spring, a source close to Kerry confirmed to CNN.
Kerry is leaving the position after three years at the helm of US climate diplomacy under the Biden administration. The source close to Kerry said he will still attend the World Economic Forum in January and is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference in February.
The 80-year-old former secretary of state and Democratic nominee for president led US negotiations at three international climate summits, the most recent of which was held in Dubai.
Kerry specifically prioritized restarting international climate talks between the US and China, and was key in negotiating the November Sunnylands agreement, a wide-ranging climate agreement between the two countries before COP28.
Axios first reported Kerry was stepping down and intends to join the Biden campaign. CNN has reached out to the Biden campaign and the White House for comment.
Before joining the Biden administration, Kerry had long worked on climate issues. As secretary of state, he played a key role in negotiating the Paris agreement, which was adopted by nearly 200 nations in 2015 and was aimed at addressing the negative impacts of climate change.
And in 2019, Kerry co-founded a bipartisan initiative of world leaders and celebrities to combat the climate crisis called World War Zero.
Kerry also served alongside Joe Biden in the Senate for decades. He was first elected to the Senate to represent Massachusetts in 1984 after serving as lieutenant governor of the state under Gov. Michael Dukakis.
In 2004, Kerry won the Democratic nomination for president before losing the general election to incumbent President George W. Bush. In 2009, when Biden became vice president, Kerry took over his role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was nominated to serve as secretary of state by Barack Obama in 2012.
Kerry also served in the Navy in Vietnam as a gunboat officer on the Mekong Delta and was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts."

Iowans headed to the first presidential primary for the 2024 election Monday will have to brave what looks likely to be the coldest caucus in state history. And the cold is expected to test Texas’s notoriously vulnerable-to-extreme-temperatures power grid for the first time this winter.
Temperatures could drop as low as 20 to 30 degrees below zero in the northern Plains both Friday and Saturday night and combine with gusty winds to make for frigid wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero.
More than 25 million people from Washington to Illinois are under wind chill alerts where frostbite could occur in as little as 10 minutes on exposed skin.
The cold will spread south and east across the country and eventually envelop Texas and other parts of the South by the weekend, lasting into the middle of next week.
Afternoon high temperatures on Friday will likely fail to reach zero degrees across much of Montana and North Dakota. High temperatures in the single digits and 10s will then spread east into parts of the central Plains and Midwest.
By the weekend, the coldest air will stretch from Denver to Indianapolis, with temperatures at least 30 degrees below normal.
Denver’s high temperature is forecast to drop from 33 degrees on Friday to 10 degrees on Saturday, dipping to 7 degrees Sunday. The wind chill Sunday morning in Denver is expected to be as low as minus 20 degrees.

The plummeting temperatures will increase power demand on Texas’s power grid enough that the state’s independent grid operator, ERCOT, issued a weather watch for Monday, warning of the impending surge in demand and a potential dip in reserves.
On Thursday, ERCOT said there was expected to be enough power to avoid outages. More than 200 people died – most of them from hypothermia – during a historic bout of cold and an ice storm in February 2021 during which ERCOT implemented rolling power outages to prevent the power grid’s collapse.
While it will be cold in Texas, it’s not expected to be as severe, widespread or prolonged as in 2021.
This cold air is not expected to threaten any significant records, but will come as quite a shock after a warm start to winter.
Chicago hasn’t had a high temperature below freezing since November 28, Brett Borchardt, meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Chicago told CNN. Wind chills on Monday in Chicago will be “near or below minus 30 degrees,” Borchardt said, “comparable to the 2017-2018 cold snap.”
Coldest Iowa caucuses on record
Iowa has held caucuses every four years since 1972 in either January or February, putting them at risk for cold, but nothing like what’s forecast next week.
Monday’s caucuses look like they will end up being the coldest ever.
Monday is forecast to be the state’s coldest January day in five years, with wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees. Iowans will wake up to temperatures more than 15 degrees below zero on Monday morning.
Most of the state will not climb above zero degrees Monday afternoon, aside from far southeastern portions which may reach a degree or two above zero.
The temperature in Des Moines may fail to reach zero degrees for the first time since February 2021. The forecast average temperature on Monday in Des Moines is minus 9.5 degrees, nearly 20 degrees colder than the previous coldest caucus night on January 19, 2004. Add winds, and the cold will be a life-threatening minus 20 degrees to minus 40 degrees.
The likely record caucus cold spans several other Iowa cities, including Sioux City, Cedar Rapids and Davenport.

The ski resorts stockpiling snow to resist global warming,https://www.cnn.com/travel/snow-farming-climate/index.html,"The ski resorts stockpiling snow to resist global warming
Follow:
It’s the white gold that gives ski resorts their essence, but these days, snow is an increasingly precious commodity.
Whether it’s falling from the sky in silent, fluffy flakes or being pumped out of the now ubiquitous snow cannons lining the ski runs, resorts rely on the white stuff to maintain a viable business.
But with climate change affecting snow reliability in the mountains, particularly in lower altitude resorts, more and more venues are employing a third method to supplement coverage and attract enough visitors to open the lifts at the start of the season.
Snow farming is the practice of stockpiling snow from the end of one season, collecting and storing it under a vast tent of insulated mats, then spreading it out again next winter – like rolling up the red carpet after the Oscars ready for next year, then spreading it out again the following winter.
Innovative Finland strikes again
One place this seemingly straightforward approach is being pioneered is the resort of Levi in the far north of Finland.
There, they ensure the resort can open in early October, and virtually guarantee the early-season World Cup ski races can go ahead in November, by using farmed snow to lay down a base layer on certain runs without needing to rely on nature’s bounty.
Nor do they have to operate the snow cannons – which force out water and compressed air to fall as snow crystals – in less-than optimal conditions, leading to huge savings in electricity and water.
These ski resorts are traditionally good bets for snowy slopes
“Of course, snow is the most critical element in this skiing business, it’s our gold so we save the gold by storing it and using the snow to help start the season,” said Marko Mustonen, commercial director of Levi.
“Sometimes it’s tough, the seasons aren’t always excellent and snow in winter arrives at different times.
“When winter starts, one day it is -5 C (-23 F), one day it is raining, but we don’t need to worry about these types of conditions because we have a nice, certain layer of snow already.
“We can then use the automatic [snow cannon] systems to make skiing as good as possible after that. If we make snow in -10C rather than -1C or zero C it is almost 10 times better efficiency.”
Learning curve
In Levi, there are nine strategically placed storage areas for the stockpiled snow, which this year amounted to 200,000 cubic meters. All the snow mounds are covered with 70 milimeter (2.8-inch) -thick insulated mats, made of Finnfoam used in the construction industry, and topped with a waterproof sheet.
“At the moment under our mats in the north part of Finland, the melting rate is under 13%, which is pretty good,” said Kalle Palander, a retired Finnish ski racing champion and sales director for Snow Secure, the company behind the insulation.
“And every year we learn more.”
What began on a small scale in 2016 to combat repeated cancellations of the World Cup slalom races on the Levi Black slope has grown into a wider operation to prepare a number of ski runs for visitors, including the new showpiece Levi Glacier run, as well as cross-country tracks, some of which can be preserved under a layer of sawdust or woodchips.
An Italian ski resort shut down by climate change plans to reopen with artificial snow. Not everyone is happy
“It’s important, economically, for the ski resort,” adds Mustonen. “It means when we get the first lift opened, we get people here and we are alive.”
Snow farming is just a small part of Levi’s overall snow production and management, but it has contributed to the resort’s commitment to reducing its carbon emissions, on the way to becoming net zero carbon “by 2050 or as soon as possible.”
Levi, which has used renewable electricity since 2020, has also switched its fleet of snow grooming machines to biofuel for the 2023-24 season, making the snow farming even a greener alternative to fossil fuels.
Olympic solution
Machine-made snow has been a long-time ingredient in producing top-level ski racing tracks, and skiing on farmed snow from last year is equally as good as the fresh stuff, says Mustonen.
“You wouldn’t find any difference on it, and it’s maybe even holding better, it’s very good for skiing,” he said.
Even back in 2014, organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia were storing about 800,000 cubic metres of snow to supplement the natural and man-made supplies to ensure the alpine events could go ahead, mindful of the unpredictable conditions at the Rosa Khutor venue and the lack of snow at Vancouver 2010. A similar process was repeated at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.
In Cervinia in Italy this summer, five great mounds covered in white matting stored snow to lay down a base for the new World Cup downhill ski run, starting high up on the Theodul Glacier above Zermatt in Switzerland before swooping across the border and plunging down to a finish line on the Italian side, overseen by the imposing pyramid of the Matterhorn.
Austria’s Kitzbuhel, home of the infamous Hahnenkamm downhill ski race, has been snow farming since 2015 and uses it to prepare piste No. 71 (Resterkogel) for early-season skiing. The snow depot is sited directly on the sheltered piste to limit transportation and contains about 30,000 cubic metres of snow, stored under insulated covers.
In Davos in Switzerland, snow farming is used to create a four-kilometer (2.5-mile) cross-country ski trail that is open by the end of October. About 20,000 cubic meters of machine-made snow – which is harder and more compact than natural snow and so better for conserving – is created the previous December or January when the weather is at its coldest and is covered in wood chippings and then spread out in the fall, with about 80% remaining. The track is open to professionals and amateurs alike with bookable time slots.
“It’s very popular for professional cross-country skiers, and we get skiers from maybe 12 nations coming here for early training,” said Samuel Rosenast, head of communications for Davos.
Saving glaciers
In North America, resorts including Banff Sunshine in Canada and Arapahoe Basin in Colorado trap wind-blown snow with a network of fences for redistribution to other parts of the ski area but they are still using that year’s supply which melts back into the watershed in summer.
Another Swiss resort, Laax, uses snow farming to protect its endangered Vorab Glacier, which experts predict could disappear in the next 30-35 years if manmade global warming continues at the same rate.
Snow is redistributed onto the glacier in May and covered in insulation until September to slow down the melting of the ice and to preserve the foundations of the drag lift which serves the ski runs.
French ski resort closes permanently because there’s not enough snow
“Covering parts of the glacier and pushing a lot of snow together in spring allows us to open the glacier for winter sports a little earlier in autumn, as we don’t need the same amount of new snow coming from the sky,” said a spokesperson for Laax.
In southeast Switzerland, glaciologists Felix Keller and Johannes Oerlemans found through a 2017 pilot study and subsequent computer modeling that covering part of the fast-retreating Morteratsch Glacier with machine-made snow could slow down its rate of melting and could even lead to growth of the glacier in 10 years in the right conditions.
The idea is that a lattice of sprinklers employing similar technology to snow cannons is placed over one square kilometer of the most melt-prone ice and constantly sprayed with sustainably produced artificial snow.
The project, known as MortAlive, was launched in February 2021 and is in the fund-raising and development stage, but critics say it is a sticking-plaster solution when the real fix is to halt human-induced climate change."
"The West’s winter is off to a dry start, raising concerns for the nation’s largest reservoirs",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/climate/west-snow-water-reservoirs-climate/index.html,"The West’s winter is off to a dry start, raising concerns for the nation’s largest reservoirs

Even as winter arrived in the East this week, with treacherous snow and an impending Arctic cold snap, much of the West and its major river basins are still entrenched in warm and dry conditions. It’s a sluggish start to what should be the region’s wet season and is raising concerns about the future of the water supplies that depend on it.
The weather through early January was “great for outdoor activities like beach volleyball but not great for water supply,” Bill Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River Resources for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to Los Angeles, told CNN.
Although meteorologists and Western water experts caution it’s still early in the winter and a lot can change between now and April, the warm, dry weather is notable for how far-reaching it has been.
“What is interesting to me is just how widespread the below average conditions are,” Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University, said in an email. Usually at this point, some areas are below-average snowpack while others are above-average, Udall told CNN. “This year, that is not the case. The whole West, so far, is quite dry.”
This year’s weather and precipitation pattern so far stands in stark contrast to last winter – a blockbuster year for snow that filled reservoirs across the West. If 2023 was a “gamechanger” for the West’s water supplies, 2024 could be shaping up to be an anxiety-inducing pivot back to drought.
World is dangerously close to a global warming limit as 2023 goes down as hottest on record
Several atmospheric rivers last winter dumped snow across the West by the start of January. But that stormy pattern hasn’t shown up yet this year, said Paul Miller, a hydrologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Colorado Basin River Forecast Center.
“We just had a historic number of those last year and this year it’s been zero,” Miller told CNN. “This can change; we’ve gotten off to drier starts in the past and recovered.”
Snowpack conditions as of early January were 40% to 70% below normal in the upper Colorado River basin, officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday, and there’s “little to no snow” in the lower basin.
But they also noted January temperatures are dipping, and more precipitation is starting to fall in the region, and a midweek storm slammed the Northwest and Northern California with heavy snow and rain. Still, NOAA experts noted Wednesday that these storms were “unlikely to completely erase existing deficits.”
There was some hope this year that El Nino – a Pacific Ocean phenomenon that influences weather around the world – would bring more storms to the West. But NOAA scientists cautioned on Monday that its impact is not as far-reaching; it could bring wetter conditions to the Southwest but drier-than-normal weather to southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. And Northern California is unlikely to be impacted by a typical El Nino, NOAA scientists said.
The region is no stranger to variability of a record wet winter followed by several drier ones, Miller said. But human-caused climate change is making drought longer and more persistent, making each wet year more important, he added.
“It’s very difficult to pinpoint single years or events to climate change,” Miller said. “But this current pattern we’re in over the last 20 to 30 years is very symptomatic of climate change impacts.”
Largest reservoirs are far below normal
In California, the first survey of the year revealed a miniscule snowpack, with about 7.5 inches of snow equivalent to about 3 inches of melted water.
It’s a “pretty modest” showing, said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, especially considering last year at this time California was measuring 55.5 inches of snow.
The good news for California, however, is its reservoirs are full for the first time in years – meaning there is ample water to help get through the year.
“Our reservoirs are in much better condition because last year was so incredibly wet,” Nemeth said.
Norway parliament approves highly controversial deep sea mining
If the state does get a big storm, she said, some dams are already so full they may activate their flood spillways much earlier in the year than is typical. The state would also try to direct extra water that can’t fit in the reservoir into groundwater recharge ponds – attempting to raise depleted groundwater levels, Nemeth said.
“It’s good news for water supply that our reservoir conditions are orders of magnitude much healthier than they were a year ago,” Nemeth said.
Even though California’s dams are full, the nation’s largest reservoirs still have a long way to go. Water levels in lakes Mead and Powell – fed by the Colorado River – are far below average.
“Even though conditions definitely improved there, they’re such massive reservoirs that they’re at critically low levels,” Miller said.
While last winter bolstered water supplies across the West after several perilously dry years, several experts said it’s unlikely a historic water year of that magnitude will happen twice in a row.
“You tend to get wet years followed by several dry years,” Hasencamp said. “We shouldn’t expect every year to be dry, but we should expect more dry years than wet years.”"

Follow:
An eerily familiar situation will play out later this week as a new, powerful storm mirrors the path and hazards of the massive storm that slammed much of the country earlier this week.
Thousands of people are still without power in the eastern US, rivers are rising and forcing evacuations, and at least four people are dead from severe thunderstorms and wind as the first storm ended Wednesday.
The new storm will place the same parts of the central and eastern US at risk once more – amplifying the potential impact for those still recovering.
The origins of the new storm are rooted in the Pacific Northwest, which was walloped by blizzard conditions on Tuesday.
Snow and blustery winds moved from the Northwest into the Four Corners region by late Wednesday. A round of snow will target the high elevations of Arizona and New Mexico through Thursday.
The storm will then morph into a much larger beast – its strengthening aided by a big push of atmospheric energy – as it exits the Plains by Thursday evening and sets the stage for a highly impactful event in the central and eastern US.
Here’s a breakdown of what to expect.
Thursday night: Snow for Plains, severe risk for South
The storm will strengthen Thursday night and begin to dump snow, which may be heavy at times, from parts of Kansas and Nebraska into the Midwest. This snow will be accompanied once again by gusty winds which may lead to whiteout conditions. Travel Thursday night may become treacherous.
Simultaneously, very cold air will plunge south out of Canada and send temperatures plummeting across much of the north-central US.
A severe thunderstorm threat will once again target a significant portion of the South. Parts of Arkansas, eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana, including Shreveport, have an enhanced risk of severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, on Thursday night, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
The main threats in those areas are strong tornadoes, large to very large hail and damaging wind gusts.
A slight risk for severe storms, or Level 2 of 5, is in place Thursday night for a wider area, from eastern Texas to western Mississippi. The main threats there are tornadoes, strong gusts and large hail.
Friday: Storm’s threats reach their peak
As the storm moves east on Friday and continues to become stronger, snow will envelop more of the Midwest.
The highest snow accumulations from this storm are expected to remain confined to portions of Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Close to a foot of snow may fall in some inland portions of each state, away from the relative warmth of the Great Lakes.
Some uncertainty remains in exactly how much snow this storm delivers to Chicago. Its proximity to Lake Michigan could mean air temperatures are unable to drop low enough for a significant amount of snow. But, if the city gets trapped under a particularly heavy band of snow, much more could manage to stick and lead to significant travel issues.
Meanwhile, brutally cold air will continue to expand across more of the central and northern US. Air temperatures in Omaha, Nebraska, are unlikely to climb out of the single digits on Friday while parts of North Dakota will be lucky if high temperatures reach zero degrees.
On the southern, warm side of the storm, another significant severe thunderstorm event will target a large section of the Southeast and portions of the mid-Atlantic.
The greatest risk of damaging storms encompasses areas from Alabama to North Carolina. A Level 3 out of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place for this area Friday and damaging wind gusts and a few strong tornadoes are possible.
Rain will overspread more of the mid-Atlantic and reach parts of the Northeast Friday night. Flooding concerns will increase from parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey into Southern New England as the rain arrives.
Rainfall totals are expected to be about the same or slightly lower than the last storm: 1 to 2 inches are likely, but isolated locations could see closer to 3 inches. With the ground soaked and rivers still swollen from the last storm, flooding could happen much more easily.
Saturday: Power outage chances increase for Northeast
The storm will reach the Northeast by the earliest hours of Saturday morning, with snow and potentially some sleet mixed in across the interior Northeast, especially in northern New England.
Along with the winter precipitation, strong winds will once again slam the Northeast and additional power outages are likely. The last storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people in the East, and many remain without power on Wednesday.
Snow will continue across the Great Lakes as well, with some lake-effect snow likely to develop in the wake of the storm late Saturday.
The most significant impacts from the storm will generally exit the Southeast and mid-Atlantic by Saturday morning, but some breezy conditions will remain in the storm’s wake.
In the central US, brutal cold will only get worse throughout the weekend and into next week. Temperatures will reach dangerous levels, especially across the north-central US.

Snow is disappearing as the planet warms. A new study shows who’s losing the most,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/10/climate/snow-loss-northern-hemisphere-study-climate/index.html,"Snow is disappearing as the planet warms. A new study shows who’s losing the most
Follow:
Vast swaths of the US have been hit with powerful storms, including blizzards that have blanketed parts of the Midwest and Northeast in snow. But something’s amiss: many states accustomed to white winters are now getting more rain than snow.
A new study published on Wednesday shows that the human-caused climate crisis has reduced snowpack in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere in the last 40 years, threatening crucial water resources for millions of people.
It might seem logical that a warmer world would be less hospitable to snow, but the relationship between snow and climate change is complex, and scientists have for many years struggled to make a clear connection between the two.
Part of the problem has been that snowfall is notoriously difficult to measure accurately, and scientific data from ground observations, satellites, and climate models have given contradictory signals on the role of climate change in declining snowpacks. Some areas have even experienced more snow in our warmer world.
But Wednesday’s study, published by researchers at Dartmouth College in the journal Nature, offers the big picture — climate change has caused significant drops in snow in the world’s north since the 1980s. Areas in the US Southwest and Northeast, as well as in Central and Eastern Europe, have experienced the steepest global warming-related declines of between 10% and 20% per decade.
“It’s very clear that climate change has been having negative impacts on snow and water,” said Alexander Gottlieb, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at Dartmouth College. “And every additional degree of warming is going to take away a bigger and bigger chunk of your snow water resources.”
Less snow means less water supply
The researchers found that snowpack loss accelerates when average winter temperatures at a location rise above minus 8 degrees Celsius (around 17 degrees Fahrenheit), a point they refer to as a “snow-loss cliff.” Past that, snow loss accelerates with even modest rises in temperature.
That’s a huge problem for communities that depend on snow for water. Many of the world’s water supplies are already threatened by climate change through drought and heat waves that are becoming more frequent and intense. As the planet continues to warm, the study found that many highly populated areas that rely on snow are going to see increased losses in water availability over the next few decades.
US climate pollution fell in 2023 as country shutters coal-fired power plants, new data shows
“When you have a regime shifting to one that’s no longer snow-dominated in the winter, but instead is rain-dominated, you have a situation where you can have reservoirs at half full, or less,” Justin Mankin, senior author of the study and associate professor of geography in Dartmouth, told CNN. “Then the question becomes ‘well, are we going to have a rainy spring?’” to compensate for water withdrawals from places downstream.
They also looked at river basins to measure how much snow water resource had dropped. The study found a declining trend in snowpack across 82 out of 169 major Northern Hemisphere river basins, including the Colorado River in the US and the Danube River in Europe, with 31 of those confidently showing the fingerprints of human-caused climate change.
“Most of the world’s people live in river basins that are at this precipice of falling off an accelerating snow-loss cliff, whereby every additional degree of warming means greater and greater snowpack loss,” Mankin said.
To reach their conclusions, the researchers specifically analyzed snowpack declines in March between 1981 and 2020, because it provides a “convenient summary of all winter weather,” Mankin said. He noted that the amount of snow on the ground in March indicates what the winter conditions were like that season before spring melts the reservoir that trickles downstream to supply water for households and agriculture.
“March snowpack is emblematic of everything that happened over the winter, and we do test the sensitivity of that measure,” Mankin said.
Back-to-back years of less snowpack in the western US have already given a preview of what future winters and springs could look like in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, from unprecedented water shortages to worsening wildfires, said Mankin.
Snow also helps prevent wildfires or can reduce their intensity. Unlike rain, which can run off quickly, snow melts slowly over time and can provide a slow and sustained release of water into the soil, making it less likely to ignite and providing less fuel for fires to spread.
World is dangerously close to a global warming limit as 2023 goes down as hottest on record
Less snowpack also carries a significant toll for places that rely on winter recreational activities, such as skiing and snowboarding, as key economic drivers. Many ski resorts in the Northern Hemisphere are facing such challenges already, with many now relying on snow cannons to ensure there’s enough snow to keep businesses operational. Some places are approaching temperature thresholds that will make even machine-made snow unviable.
Mona Hemmati, postdoctoral research scientist at the Columbia Climate School, who was not involved with the study, said the research provided “compelling evidence” of how human-caused climate change is influencing snow patterns.
“What makes this study groundbreaking is its approach to isolating the effects of anthropogenic climate change from natural climate variability,” Hemmati told CNN. “This study serves as a crucial reminder of the escalating impacts of climate change and the imperative for immediate and concerted action to address this global challenge.”"

Follow:
Planet-warming pollution in the US decreased nearly 2% in 2023 even as the economy grew, according to new data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group.
The falling emissions, driven largely by retirements of dirty, coal-fired power plants, put US climate pollution at its lowest level since 1991, Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN. But the numbers also show the nation is nowhere near hitting the aggressive climate targets laid out by President Joe Biden at the start of his first term.
In order to achieve Biden’s goal of cutting emissions in half by the end of the decade, King said the current reductions would have to triple to around 7% reductions per year. That would take much more wind, solar, nuclear and other zero-emissions energy providing electricity to the grid, more vehicles on the road powered by electricity or zero-emission fuels, and heavy industry like steel, cement and chemical manufacturers slashing their emissions.
“It’s good to see emissions moving in this direction, but more work is needed to keep the US on track for its Paris goals,” King said. It remains to be seen whether the US can keep its promise to steeply cut its emissions, and the US will have to update its targets next year – a step that will be shaped by the outcome of the 2024 election.
World is dangerously close to a global warming limit as 2023 goes down as hottest on record
The data shows continued cutbacks on coal energy have a big impact on US climate pollution. Unlike in China, no new coal plants are being built in the US, and many utilities are retiring aging and costly power plants that were built in the 1970s and 1980s.
“We do see coal … is back to where it was in the Nixon administration,” King said. “We’ve resumed a structural decline in coal in the power sector which has been going on in the (natural gas) fracking revolution.”
The Rhodium data underscores cutting emissions and growing the economy can be done at the same time, King noted, especially given the massive amount of tax subsidies for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act. Rhodium’s numbers weren’t able to take much of the IRA’s impacts on the EV and clean energy industries into account, as 2023 was a year that the Biden administration spent issuing guidance around the law.
“Increasing deployment of these clean energy technologies, the IRA helps make the economic case for that,” King said. Other barriers remain, such as fast energy permitting to get more clean energy on the grid, and getting more EV charging stations built, but “if you can make it so darn cheap,” the ingredients for deep decarbonization are there, King said."

Global warming in 2023 hit 1.48 degrees Celsius, data published Tuesday shows, as the hottest year on record propelled the world just hundredths of a degree away from a critical climate threshold.
Analyses last year had already confirmed 2023 to be the warmest on record, but Tuesday’s data shows an alarming leap in heating from 2016, previously the hottest year. In 2023, the average global temperature was 14.98 degrees Celsius — 0.17 degrees above the previous record — while warming in the world’s oceans also hit a new high.
Scientists repeatedly expressed shock in 2023 as successive heat records fell, and warned the world is moving dangerously close to the 1.5-degree limit that nearly 200 countries sought to avoid in the Paris Agreement in 2015.
The data and an analysis, published by Copernicus — the EU’s climate and weather monitoring agency — says that global warming may worsen at the start of this year, projecting that a 12-month period ending in January or February will likely breach 1.5 degrees.
But scientists are far more concerned about a long-term state of warming of 1.5 degrees and above — rather than individual years. Above that threshold, many of the Earth’s ecosystems will struggle to adapt and summertime heat will approach the limits of human survivability in some places.
The unprecedented heat in 2023 was caused primarily by climate change, Copernicus said, but was exacerbated by El Niño, a natural climate variability that increases Pacific Ocean heat and typically boosts the world’s temperatures.
World’s biggest polluter just had its hottest year on record, marked by deadly extreme weather
While some scientists have said the 1.48 degrees of warming is in line with last year’s heat records, others are still surprised at how much hotter 2023 was over previous years.
“It is a shock that this year has unarguably smashed the global temperature record,” said Bill Collins, professor of climate processes at the University of Reading in the UK. “There is no opportunity here to quibble about hundredths of a degree, exceeding the previous record by 0.17 degrees should be an alarm call to everyone.”
Every day in 2023, the global average temperature was at least 1 degree hotter than the corresponding day in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, Copernicus said. That’s the first time on record that’s happened.
Global temperatures have been steadily increasing since the 1970s, until 1 degree of global warming was breached for the first time in 2015, according to historical temperature data from Copernicus. It took only eight years to leap another half a degree above pre-industrial levels.
Even compared to the past three decades, when temperatures have been warmer, 2023 stands out. The year was 0.6 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991-2020 average.
Temperatures rising ‘more exponentially’
Several months ago, there was a projection among the scientific community that warming would hit around 1.3 degrees in 2023, said Liz Bentley, chief executive of the UK’s Royal Meteorological Society. That prediction has been “annihilated,” she said, as temperature records fell on the regional, national and international levels around the world, including daily and monthly records.
Other thresholds are being crossed too — two days in November were, for the first time, more than 2 degrees warmer. Every month in 2023 between June and December was the hottest such month on record. July and August were the first and second-warmest on record, overall, Copernicus said.
Given the tumbling records, Bentley said, it wasn’t so much the 1.48-degree temperature rise that was surprising but the pace of climate change in recent years.
“If you look at climate projections, when we expect to see temperature changes of close to 1.5 degrees Celsius, indeed it has come sooner than many would have expected,” Bentley told CNN. “We’ve definitely seen an acceleration towards that, rather than it being a kind of linear progression. It feels like it’s rising much more exponentially.”
Annual average air temperatures were either the hottest, or nearly the hottest, on record over all ocean basins and all continents, except Australia, the Copernicus data shows. That temperature rise covers nearly the entire world map.
The year of record heat, which saw deadly extreme weather events, including wildfires in Canada, Hawaii and southern Europe, “has given us a taste of the climate extremes that occur near the Paris targets,” said Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London.
“It should shake the complacency displayed in the actions by most governments around the world,” he said.
This city rarely reaches 100 degrees. It is now considered a ‘climate refuge’
The world’s oceans also experienced unprecedented heat and remained unusually warm in 2023. Sea surface temperatures were 0.44 degrees above the 1991–2020 average, the highest on record and a leap from the 0.26-degree rise seen in 2016, the second-warmest year.
The main long-term factor behind the oceans’ alarming heat is fossil fuel pollution, but El Niño — which began in July — also contributed. Higher sea surface temperatures can lead to more powerful hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones.
At the tail end of the hottest year on record, nearly 200 countries represented at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai last month agreed for the first time to contribute to a global transition away from fossil fuels, the main cause of the climate crisis. The deal was widely welcomed, but critics say it included loopholes that would allow major fossil fuel producing nations to take little action.
“The extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilization developed,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus’ Climate Change Service. “This has profound consequences for the Paris Agreement and all human endeavors. If we want to successfully manage our climate risk portfolio, we need to urgently decarbonize our economy whilst using climate data and knowledge to prepare for the future.”"
A massive winter storm puts nearly 70 million people at risk for severe weather,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/07/weather/snow-winter-storm-northeast-climate/index.html,"A massive winter storm puts nearly 70 million people at risk for severe weather
Follow:
Nearly 70 million people across the Gulf Coast and Southeast are at risk for severe weather, including tornadoes, damaging wind and flooding rain on Monday and Tuesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
Days after the season’s first big winter storm, another storm is on the move and is expected to bring heavy snow, blizzard conditions, strong winds, potential tornadoes and serious flooding as it carves a path from the Southwest to the Northeast through midweek.
There is now a Level 3 of 5 enhanced risk Monday for cities like New Orleans, Louisiana, Gulfport, Mississippi and Mobile, Alabama, as storms sweep across the area in the afternoon and overnight. Tornadoes are especially likely in this area. Additionally, there is also a Level 3 of 4 moderate risk of excessive rainfall with 3 to 5 inches expected, which could lead to flooding.
On Tuesday, the same system moves further east, where there is an enhanced risk of severe weather for cities like Tallahassee, Florida, Albany, Georgia, and Panama City, Florida in the early morning and continuing into the afternoon.
The coming disruptive weather arrives just a day after a winter storm dumped more than a foot of snow on the Northeast and brought rain, snow, ice and even a tornado as it tracked from the Gulf Coast to Maine.
The latest system is expected to rapidly strengthen into an exceptionally powerful January storm and cause widespread, significant effects east of the Rockies beginning Monday.
Although it will be a fast-moving system, traversing over 1,800 miles in 72 hours, it will still produce notable snowfall across more than a half a dozen states.
Widespread snowfall accumulations of at least 6 inches are expected from northern New Mexico to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Heavy snow and strong winds will create blizzard conditions Sunday as the storm exits Arizona and heads to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle region Sunday night. Blizzard warnings were already hoisted in Colorado and New Mexico early Sunday morning.
Poor visibility and difficult-to-near-impossible driving conditions will set in for the Southwest on Sunday, the central and southern Plains on Monday and the Midwest on Tuesday.
Strong winds will also bring wind chill values below zero degrees for some locations in the Plains.
Snow and cold temperatures will not be the only concerns as the storm surges northeast, intensifies and expands its reach to much of the eastern half of the US into the middle of the week.
Flooding, damaging winds and even tornadoes will also be concerns.
Along the Gulf Coast, warm, moist air will fuel the threat for severe storms, including a few strong tornadoes and damaging winds.
More than 15 million people are under a severe storm threat Monday from Texas to Florida. Over 35 million people are under the same threat level Tuesday from the Panhandle of Florida to the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
An equally serious concern is the potential for significant flooding from the storm’s strong winds blowing water onshore and its potent rainmaking storms.
“Widespread and potentially significant river and flash flooding are likely from the central Gulf Coast through much of the Eastern U.S. early this week,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Powerful onshore winds will lead to widespread coastal flooding along the eastern Gulf Coast and much of the East Coast.”
Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected from the Gulf Coast to New England with isolated locations exceeding 4 inches.
There’s serious concern for flooding in the Northeast with this next wave of rain coming right after the first snowstorm dropped more than half a foot of snow in multiple Northeast states.
Heavy rain will accelerate snowmelt and increase the amount of water running off into waterways, raising the ceiling on the flood potential in these areas. As a result, there is a Level 3 out of 4 risk for flooding in portions of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania on Tuesday. A Level 2 of 4 threat spans nearly the entire path of the first storm – from Georgia through Massachusetts.
A Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding is also in place along the western coast of Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle for the flood potential from the initial round of rain on Monday.
The rainfall is both a gift and a concern for Louisiana and Mississippi – both still grappling with serious droughts, though drought has already improved substantially since November from a recent overabundance of rain.
Locations along the Gulf Coast from New Orleans to Tallahassee, Florida, are more than 5 inches  above normal for rainfall since December 1, so it won’t take much for the saturated ground to flood.
Wind is another concern with saturated ground. It makes trees more vulnerable to toppling over onto power lines or homes. And the winds will be strong enough to cause such damage.
“Gusty winds on the warm side of the storm may exceed 50 MPH and cause damage over the Appalachians to the East Coast,” the Weather Prediction Center said. The center also warned people to “prepare for power outages” from the potentially damaging winds.
The strongest winds will be closer to the coast.
High wind watches will likely be issued in the next 24 hours, but the National Weather Service office in Boston noted they might need to issue hurricane-force wind watches – warning of winds akin to a Category 1 hurricane – for coastal areas if the storm’s worst forecast fears came to pass.
Winds will also trigger high surf of 8 to 11 feet and significant beach erosion is possible. Dangerous rip currents are also likely and will continue through at least the middle of the week.
The storm system looks to wrap up near the end of the week, but another storm looks like it could follow a similar path and affect some of the same areas later in the week and into the weekend.

Extreme heat is pushing India to the brink of ‘survivability.’ One obvious solution is also a big part of the problem,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/india/extreme-heat-india-climate-ac-intl-hnk/index.html,"Extreme heat is pushing India to the brink of ‘survivability.’ One obvious solution is also a big part of the problem
Follow:
When blistering extreme heat gripped India’s capital this summer, Ramesh says he felt faint but had no option other than to keep on toiling under the burning sun to provide for his family.
“The heat is becoming unbearable,” the 34-year-old bricklayer told CNN. “But we do not have a choice, we have to work.”
Ramesh lives with his parents, three brothers, a sister-in-law, and three children, in a congested suburb in western Delhi, a city that has made headlines in recent years as mercury levels regularly climb to dangerous levels.
And as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this June – closing schools, damaging crops and putting pressure on energy supplies – the heat was making his family sick too.
Ramesh, who goes by one name, says he borrowed $35 – nearly half of his monthly salary – from relatives to buy a second-hand air conditioner for his home.
“It makes a noise, sometimes it releases dust,” he said. But he cannot do without it.
By 2050, India will be among the first places where temperatures will cross survivability limits, according to climate experts. And within that time frame, the demand for air conditioners (AC) in the country is also expected to rise nine-fold, outpacing all other appliances, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Ramesh’s predicament encapsulates the paradox facing the world’s most populous country of 1.4 billion: The hotter and wealthier India gets, the more Indians will use AC. And the more they use AC, the hotter the country will become.
India emits nearly 2.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year based on data collected by the European Union – contributing about 7% of global emissions. The United States, by comparison, causes 13% of CO2 emissions, despite having a quarter of India’s population.
This raises a question of fairness that climate scientists have often asked: should people in the developing world shoulder the cost of reducing emissions, despite being among those least responsible for rising greenhouse gases?
At the COP28 climate talks in Dubai that concluded recently, India wasn’t among the list of countries that signed a pledge to cut their emissions from cooling systems. Addressing the opening session of the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said all developing countries must be given “a fair share in the global carbon budget.”
Nonetheless India, one of the world’s fastest growing economies, is on the front line of the climate crisis. And it finds itself in a tough position. How can it balance its development while ensuring environmental protection?
Rising heat
Vast swathes of India’s population remain reliant on AC for their physical and mental wellbeing. And the country’s more tropical southern regions remain hot year-round.
Over the past five decades, the country has experienced more than 700 heat wave events claiming more than 17,000 lives, according to a 2021 study of extreme weather in the Weather and Climate Extremes journal. This June alone, temperatures in some parts of the country soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit), killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses.
And by 2030, India may account for 34 million of a projected 80 million global job losses from heat stress, according to a World Bank report in December 2022.
After a terrible year of climate news, here are 5 reasons to feel positive
This puts millions of people at risk in a country where more than 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture. And as incomes steadily rise, all while urban populations explode, AC ownership has grown at a remarkable rate.
Electricity consumption in India from cooling – which includes AC and refrigerators – increased 21% between 2019 and 2022, according to the IEA. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners will exceed total electricity consumption in all of Africa today, it added.
But this demand is also exacerbating the global climate crisis.
Like refrigerators, many air conditioners today use a class of coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are harmful greenhouse gases. And even more problematically, air conditioners tend to use large amounts of electricity, generated by the burning of fossil fuels.
The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that – if not reined in – air conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for up to a 0.5 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures by the end of the century.
India’s dilemma
India is still grappling with widespread poverty, while spending billions to upgrade its transport and urban infrastructure, as it faces longstanding challenges to improve living standards.
And limiting cooling-related emissions might be seen as a possible barrier to the country’s economic growth, experts say.
During the recent COP summit, 63 countries – including the US, Kenya and Canada – signed a pledge to cut their emissions from cooling systems by 68%, along with several other targets, by 2050. India was not among the group.
Despite this, Brian Dean, head of energy efficiency and cooling at Sustainable Energy for All, which helped to develop the agreement, said India has shown “important international leadership on cooling.”
India joins the ranks of stock market superpowers
“While it has not joined the Global Cooling Pledge yet, important progress on sustainable cooling has been made domestically and international partners hope that India considers joining in the future,” he said.
Under the United Nations’ 2016 Kigali Amendment, many countries including India are phasing out HFCs and replacing them with more climate friendly options, such as hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs.
Similar moves have worked in the past. The Kigali Amendment is an update to the Montreal Protocol that helped to phase out ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in the 1980s.
Still, countries that lack access to adequate cooling need help to meet the cost of energy improvement, according to Radhika Khosla, associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment.
“Cooling is now on the global agenda,” she said. “But the hard work must begin to ensure everyone can stay cool without further heating the planet.”
Planting trees to absorb sunlight, water bodies, courtyards that promote cooling and clever ventilation are among the more sustainable “passive cooling strategies” suggested by Khosla.
Installing ceiling fans in buildings can reduce household energy consumption for cooling by more than 20%, she added.
“If successful, passive cooling measures could curb the demand for cooling by 24% by 2050, saving $3 trillion and negating greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide,” she said.
Cooling plan
India has also promised to reduce its power demand for cooling purposes by 20-25% by 2038 under its own cooling action plan announced in 2019, while still focusing on developing and implementing cost-effective solutions that align with its economic goals.
Dean calls it “one of the first comprehensive national Cooling Action Plans to be developed globally.”
It was, he said, “an important moment for emphasizing the need to proactively and urgently address cooling demand growth, including in agriculture where sustainable cold chains can prevent food loss and improve nutritional outcomes.”
Renewable energy is also growing faster in India than in any other major economy, and data shows it’s on track to meet its emission reduction targets, according to Leena Nandan, India’s secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
What is a mass extinction, and why do scientists think we’re in the middle of one?
India remains proactive in finding climate solutions, despite not being a major contributor to the crisis, she told reporters during the COP28 summit.
“We have gone on to scale up our climate ambitions,” she said.
But India’s AC boom has been visible in almost every urban corner of the country.
Hundreds of construction sites are scattered throughout the capital, where laborers toil to build gleaming high-rise towers to house New Delhi’s burgeoning middle class.
Penta Anil Kumar, a businessman who lives in Lajpat Nagar, a bustling south Delhi neighborhood, said he is aware of the harmful emissions released from his air conditioner, and deliberately bought an energy efficient model able to meet his cooling needs.
“While I know the use of air conditioners is contributing to higher temperatures, I also know I cannot do much else,” he said.
But Kumar is among those more fortunate who can afford a more expensive AC model.
Ghasiram, a 65-year-old laborer from Delhi’s Rohini neighborhood, paid a contractor $36 to secure a second-hand AC unit for his family. But this is more than what he earns in a month.
Ghasiram, who goes by one name, said he didn’t know emissions from his AC were partly fueling rising temperatures. But he is suffering from the consequences.
“The heat has gotten worse over the years,” he said. “When I need to step out to work in the heat, I feel nervous. I prefer to not go out.”"

Improve your life in 2024 by following our Life, But Better advice for sleep, food, fitness, stress reduction and more. Start with our science-backed guidance on how to make your life greener.
It sounds like such a great resolution for the new year: I’m going to live greener. But what would it actually take to live a life that’s better for our planet, when so much of the harm done is beyond our control?
The climate crisis is not your fault, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do. Collectively, we can have a positive impact by making some pretty basic lifestyle changes.
Here are five easy ways to get started in 2024.
Rib-eye steaks and juicy cheeseburgers are huge contributors to the climate crisis. Raising beef generates a large amount of methane — a powerful planet-warming gas. It also takes a lot of energy to grow food to feed animals, which is why lamb, pork and poultry also have a significant climate impact.
Eating a plant-heavy diet tops the list of Earth-friendly changes, but you don’t need to give up meat entirely to have an impact. If you’re eating meat every day, try cutting it from the menu one day a week.
If you can’t stand the thought of giving up meat entirely, stick with poultry — it has the lowest climate impact.
‘Moment of truth’ for oil industry: Deepen the climate crisis or help fix it
Living car-free is one of the best things you can do to help rein in the climate crisis, but doing so is not possible for most people.
Instead, try to master the art of eco-driving. High speeds, hard acceleration and hard braking wastes fuel and can reduce your car’s fuel efficiency by up to 30% on the highway. Using four-wheel drive also decreases efficiency, so turn that off when you don’t really need it.
Speeds around 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour) are great for fuel efficiency if you’re driving a non-hybrid, gas-powered car. Anything over that, and you’re burning more gas than you need to.
Homes are becoming more energy efficient, but they are also getting bigger. Combine this size with higher summer temperatures and more electronics to power, and you have a recipe for an upward trend in home electricity use.
Whether you own or rent, resolve to call your electric utility and ask if you can pay for renewable energy such as solar or wind. Even if it doesn’t offer renewable energy, you’ve at least shown your utility that you’re interested in it and it’s something for which you’re willing to pay.
Plane will fly  from London to New York with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Experts say it’s not a fix
Could you create the kind of trip you’re aiming for within driving or train distance? Driving has a lower climate impact than flying, especially as cars become more fuel efficient. Driving also costs less than flying, even when gas prices are at record highs.
It also helps to avoid business- or first-class seats, because those sections carry fewer people and thus come at a climate premium.
And be strategic about your travel. Consider taking one long vacation a year instead of two shorter ones if they require flying. You still get the same amount of fun in the sun but with half the number of flights.
Personal action is necessary to help solve the climate crisis. But it’s not sufficient. We should minimize our climate impact wherever possible, but policymakers and industry leaders also need to make big strides as soon as possible.
After a terrible year of climate news, here are 5 reasons to feel positive
In the meantime, start a conversation in your city, church or workplace about how your community can do better.
“We need companies to change, as well as cities and churches, schools and universities, businesses and organizations,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate professor at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy.
“And no matter who they are, or where they are, that change begins when someone starts a conversation — about why climate change matters to them, and what they can do to make a difference.”

Follow:
Winter is about to kick into overdrive in the US. A one-two punch of winter storms and the first Arctic cold outbreak of the season are poised to affect millions of Americans through next week.
Up first, a winter storm is on track to deal a blow of heavy snow and treacherous ice to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic this weekend.
Another bigger and more potent storm will follow hot on its heels through midweek with all hazards: snow, ice, strong winds, tornadoes and flooding rainfall.
“Confidence continues to increase for a highly impactful event spanning from Texas to the Great Lakes and Northeast U.S. through the middle of the week,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Here’s the latest on these developing storms:
Weekend winter storm
Around 40 million people are under winter storm alerts from the mid-Atlantic to the Appalachians and into southern Maine, with the storm’s worst expected Saturday to Sunday in parts of the Appalachians and the interior Northeast and New England, including just to the west of Boston.
Interactive: Check to see if you’re under a winter weather alert here.
Most of the major cities along the Northeast’s I-95 corridor appear set to miss out on heavy snow, but by the time the storm exits the coast, it could have wrung out as much as 12 inches of snow and as much as 0.25 inches of ice across the eastern US.
On Friday, the storm spat out rain in parts of the South lighter snow to the north in parts of the Plains and Midwest.
The system will continue to track through the Southeast and into the mid-Atlantic Friday into Saturday, delivering heavy rain and even the threat of a few severe storms along the Gulf Coast.
Potentially damaging ice could accumulate in the southern Appalachians Friday night into Saturday morning as the storm starts to work its way into colder air. Travel in these regions could be treacherous, especially in hilly and mountainous terrain, as ice sticks to surfaces.
It appears there won’t be sufficient cold air to churn out much, if any, snow in the snow-starved I-95 corridor. None was forecast in Baltimore, DC or Philadelphia Friday, so their nearly two-year long significant snowless streaks seemed like they would continue.
But other cities, especially in New England, have higher snow chances. Four to 6 inches of snow are forecast in Boston. That may not live up to Boston’s notorious snowstorm past, but it could still be the city’s biggest snow from a single storm since February 25, 2022 when 8 inches fell.
And if the 8 inches forecast in Hartford, Connecticut, comes to pass it would be the city’s biggest snowstorm since February 1, 2021, when 11 inches fell.
Further south, areas of the Appalachians could see up to two inches of snowfall and ice accumulations as thick as 0.25 inches. Winter storm watches and warnings are in effect from western North Carolina to western Virginia beginning Friday evening and lasting through Saturday afternoon.
Powerful, sprawling storm next week
The second storm will begin to strengthen rapidly Monday as it cuts through the Central US toward the Great Lakes, delivering snow and potential blizzard conditions to colder areas to its north along its path.
Exactly where and how much snow falls will likely change with the storm’s track, which is still uncertain, but the highest chances for heavy snow are in parts of the Plains, the Great Lakes and interior Northeast.
The storm will be tapping into warmer, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to its south, raising the risk of severe storms, including a few strong tornadoes and damaging winds, and flooding rainfall near the Gulf Coast.
A Level 2 of 5 risk for severe storms is already in place for Monday and Tuesday, stretching from southeast Texas to the Carolinas.
A Level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rainfall hugs the coasts of Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle for the storms that will cross the area Monday.

As the storm moves northeast, rain and strong wind gusts will spread over much of the eastern half of the US. A Level 2 of 4 risk for flooding stretches from northeast Georgia to southern Massachusetts, and a Level 3 of 4 is in place just outside of the New York City metro in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and southeast New York, where up to 4 inches of rain could fall.
Many of these areas will have just been doused and snowed on by the first storm.
Heavy rain on its own could cause flooding, but rain on top of snow amplifies the risk, as warmer rain melts the snow and injects its water quickly into watersheds. In December, a potent storm caused deadly and destructive flooding in parts of interior New England after its heavy rain melted snow.
Widespread Arctic Air Outbreak Anticipated Across Much of the Lower 48 Through Mid-Januaryhttps://t.co/UMw8lZcKJV pic.twitter.com/lUUrgoq1uw
As the second storm departs by end of week, an “Arctic air outbreak” looks likely to descend on much of the US, according to the Climate Prediction Center.
While it’s too soon to know exactly how cold it will get, forecasts are calling for below-average temperatures through mid-January for every area save the East Coast.
And with colder air in place, there could be even more snow in the forecast in the weeks to come.

Parts of Europe are experiencing an extreme start to the new year’s weather. As some countries struggle with devastating floods, others have been plunged into extreme cold, causing chaos.
Hundreds of flood warnings are in place in the UK after heavy rainfall battered swaths of the country Thursday.
A party boat sank on the River Thames in London Thursday, with the boat’s owners saying the adverse weather conditions were likely to blame. The UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency told CNN that everyone was accounted for.
In the east of the capital, around 70 firefighters were mobilized to deal with flooding after a canal broke its banks Thursday evening.
Elsewhere in the UK, a major incident was declared in the Nottinghamshire region due to rising river levels along the River Trent, with local authorities warning river levels could come close to record highs.
Thursday’s heavy rainfall came on the heels of Storm Henk, which swept southern parts of the country earlier this week, bringing strong winds and rain.
﻿The storm claimed at least one life after a man died Tuesday when a tree fell onto the car he was driving in Gloucestershire, southwest England, according to local police.
The same storm also brought intense flooding to northern parts of France, leaving hundreds without power, forcing more than 370 evacuations and causing one death.
The Pas-de-Calais department of northern France was under “red alert” for flooding on Thursday, according to the country’s national weather service Météo France, but was moved to orange alert, the next level down, Friday.
Local authorities warned people in affected areas not to go into their basements, to avoid travel and stay away from waterways.
Germany, too, has been badly affected in regions that have seen persistent flooding over the past two weeks.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited a heavily affected flood zone in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt Thursday.
Around 200 soldiers will start their deployment Friday in Mansfeld-Südharz, a district in the state, where they will distribute 600,000 sandbags, according to a spokesperson for the country’s armed forces.
The full extent of flood damage in Germany is not yet clear but more rain is expected Friday, according to Helge Tuschy from Germany’s Weather Service.
Many of the same parts of northwestern Europe that have been flooded this month were also battered by Storm Ciarán, which brought hurricane-strength winds and claimed several lives in November.
Climate change, driven primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, is causing extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, to become more frequent and more intense.
As the Earth’s atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water vapor — so when it rains, it rains much more intensely, increasing the likelihood of destructive flooding.
Last year was the hottest on record globally.
Arctic blast
It’s a tale of different extremes in Europe this week, as heavy rainfall and milder temperatures in some parts contrast starkly with an intense cold snap further north.
An Arctic blast has brought some record-low temperatures to parts of Scandinavia including northern Sweden and Finland along with heavy snow, causing chaos on the roads.
Kvikkjokk-Årrenjarka, in northern Sweden, recorded -43.6 degrees Celsius (-46.4 Fahrenheit) Wednesday, the lowest temperature in that location since records began in 1887, said Sverker Hellström, a meteorologist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.
Snow drifts have caused severe impacts on the roads, leaving people stuck in their cars, Hellström told CNN.
On Thursday, rescue services evacuated hundreds of people who had been trapped overnight in their cars due to heavy snow, according to a Reuters report.
In the far northwest of Finland, temperatures in the municipality of Enontekiö dropped to -42.4 degrees Celsius (-44.3 Fahrenheit), marking country’s lowest temperature for 18 years.
A woman was found dead Tuesday after going skiing in a blizzard in northern Finland with her child, whose body was found Thursday, according to Reuters.
Scandinavia has been grappling with biting cold since December. Norway’s average temperature in December was 2.3 degrees below average, with Sweden and Finland seeing temperatures as low as 6 degrees below average across certain regions.
The very cold weather may also have contributed to the Bothnian Bay, between Sweden and Finland, completely freezing over earlier than usual, said Mika Ratanen, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. It’s the earliest in winter this has happened since 2011, he told CNN.
“Currently it looks like we will have a pretty good ice situation in the Baltic Sea this winter, probably the best we have had in many years,” he told CNN.
Temperatures in the region are predicted to remain well below average through Friday and the weekend before returning to closer to average next week.

China saw its hottest year on record in 2023, state media reported this week, as the world’s biggest polluter confronted a series of relentless heat waves and other extreme weather events driven by the human-caused climate crisis.
Daily and monthly temperature records were repeatedly shattered as the year wore on while the country grappled with scorching heat waves, which authorities said had arrived earlier and been more widespread and extreme than in previous years.
China’s exceptional warmth echoed global trends – with scientists confirming that 2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, the result of the combined effects of El Niño and climate change.
The average temperature in China last year stood at 10.7 degrees Celsius – the highest since records began in 1961, according to the National Climate Center, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
It breaks the previous record of 10.5°C set in 2021.
Across the country, 127 weather stations recorded their highest ever daily temperatures, state-run newspaper China Daily reported.
The year’s most extreme weather shows what a warming planet is capable of, and what’s to come
The highest of those was 52.2°C on July 16 in Turpan’s Sanpu town, in the far western Xinjiang region.
The prolonged and persistent heat affected hundreds of millions of people and put huge strain on the country’s power grid. In July, China Energy Investment Corporation, one of the world’s largest generators of coal-fired power, said the volume of electricity it produced had hit a daily record.
There were also reports of farm animals, including pigs, rabbits and fish, dying from the searing temperatures and wheat fields in central China being flooded by heavy rainfall, raising concerns about food security in the world’s second largest economy.
A similar story played out across the world in 2023, with a series of deadly heat waves and remarkable record temperatures hitting several continents, while unprecedented ocean heat blanketed much of the globe.
Analysis from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found 2023’s global temperature will be more than 1.4 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels — close to the 1.5-degree threshold in the Paris climate agreement, and beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt.
Extreme highs and lows
At the other end of the scale, China also recorded its lowest ever temperature last year on January 22, when Jintao town in Mohe, northeastern Heilongjiang province dropped to -53° C.
And in December, the capital Bejing recorded its longest cold wave since records began in 1951, as sub-zero temperatures stretched heating capacity of some cities in northern China to its limit.
China’s extreme weather also saw some of the heaviest rainfall in decades, with flooding bringing devastation to millions of people’s lives and causing billions of dollars in damage.
A total of 55 national weather stations recorded their highest daily rainfall in 2023, according to the National Climate Center.
Typhoon Doksuri slammed into southeastern Fujian province on July 28, bringing rains that soaked Hebei, a province of 75 million, and the neighboring cities of Beijing and Tianjin.
Flooding in those regions killed about 30 people, displaced more than 1 million and  washed away houses, bridges and highways, according to Chinese authorities.
The storm also brought the heaviest rainfall Beijing has experienced in 140 years, marking a significant test of the region’s capacity to handle extreme weather that experts warn will become more frequent with climate change.
After a terrible year of climate news, here are 5 reasons to feel positive
Scientists are clear that the climate crisis is making extreme weather events – such as heat waves, storms and heavy rainfall – more frequent and intense, and they will continue to become more frequent and severe as the planet heats up while humans burn more fossil fuels.
China is the world’s biggest polluter, making up nearly 30% of global emissions and accounting for over half of global demand for coal, according to the International Energy Agency.
The World Bank has said that without China successfully reducing its planet-heating emissions and transitioning to clean energy, the world will have little chance of achieving its climate goals.
China has been accelerating production of sustainable energy and  the country is on track to double its wind and solar energy capacity and hit its 2030 clean energy targets as soon as 2025, a June report found.
In November, China pledged a major ramp-up of renewable energy, alongside the United States, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The country also played a key role in climate negotiations at the COP28 summit in Dubai in December, which made an unprecedented call to transition away from fossil fuels.
However, China did not sign an official agreement to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency, both by 2030, according to Carbon Brief.

Who will see snow this weekend? First big winter storm of the season targets Northeast and mid-Atlantic,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/04/weather/northeast-winter-storm-snow-climate/index.html,"Who will see snow this weekend? First big winter storm of the season targets Northeast and mid-Atlantic
Follow:
A substantial storm is poised to smack the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic with winter’s first dose of big snow and dangerous ice.
Winter storm watches, warning the millions in the storm’s path of its weekend arrival, were hoisted Thursday from southern North Carolina to southern Maine.
As of Thursday, the highest confidence for significant snow was in portions of the interior Northeast, including central Pennsylvania and southeastern New York state, and southern and central New England, including areas just west of Boston.
That means cities like DC, Baltimore and New York – all waiting nearly two years for an inch of snow in a calendar day – could miss out on snow and instead experience rain or wintry mix.
But just 50 miles could separate areas that experience heavy snow from those that experience mixed precipitation or only rain, meaning small shifts in the storm’s final track and timing will make a massive difference.
Regardless of the storm’s final snow totals, an impactful winter storm capable of disrupting travel is coming.
What to expect in major cities
Forecast model trends have not been kind to snow lovers in the major cities along the Northeast’s I-95 corridor, where it appears there won’t be sufficient cold air to churn out much snow there. Instead, rain and wintry mix is more likely.
But farther inland, this storm could produce 6 to 12 inches of snow in parts of the interior Northeast and New England, where the heaviest snow is expected. The main event for snow in the Northeast will be Saturday night and Sunday as the storm tracks through the area and then off the coast.
Here’s a breakdown of what is expected in major metro areas as of Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service.
Heavy rain and ice potential
The system responsible for the potential winter weather will first cross the southern half of the US through Friday, before swooping up the East through the weekend.
In much of the South and Southeast this will mean a cool rain as the storm taps into ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
Some storms could turn severe on Friday closer to the Gulf Coast where there’s more potential for heavy rain and flooding.
For Louisiana and Mississippi, still suffering from drought after a summer of extreme heat and a lack of rain, the rain will be largely beneficial.
Rain will begin Thursday evening in central Texas and progress with the storm’s track to the east, overrunning the Southeast through Friday.
The storm will then drive north into the mid-Atlantic Saturday dumping heavy rain and freezing rain on parts of the southern Appalachians and Piedmont. The chance for 0.1 inches of ice or greater there will make travel treacherous, especially given the elevation.
Historic snow droughts could continue
Despite lower snow chances, if even an inch were to fall in major cities along the I-95 corridor, it would end significant snowless streaks for some that have dragged on for nearing two years.
What you should have in stock when preparing for a winter storm
New York City has waited nearly 700 days for an inch of snow in a single calendar day. Only 2.3 inches fell in Central Park during the entirety of 2023, making it the city’s least snowy calendar year on record, according to the National Weather Service. The same was true for Philadelphia and the DC area’s Dulles International Airport.
It’s not as if the Northeast has gone without precipitation. In mid-December, a powerful and deadly coastal storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands and triggered severe flooding across the region.
But it’s just been too warm for precipitation to fall as snow, something that’s becoming more common as global temperatures rise because of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution.
Much of the US endured a warmer-than-average December. The warmer temperatures meant snow was harder to come by. As a result, snow cover, or how much land is covered by snow, is at its lowest extent in North America since 2005, NOAA data shows."

Follow:
Before the last autumn leaf fades, it’s a good idea to put your garden to bed, as the saying goes. Whether winter brings you just a few snowflakes or epic snowdrifts, you can take steps to ensure that the coldest season takes only the smallest toll on your landscape.
Then, as the first deep freezes and chilly snowflakes arrive, your garden and gear will be safely tucked in for a long winter’s nap.
Learn about simple mistakes you want to avoid as you wrap up your garden for winter.
Mistake No. 1: Planting Too Late
Making late additions to the landscape can result in devastating losses next spring, especially in areas where the ground freezes. Perennials are the most susceptible to late planting, as alternating freezing and thawing of soil literally shoves plants out of soil, exposing crowns. Shrubs and trees can go into the ground later, but for best winter survival rates, you should have all plants in place by six weeks before soil typically freezes.
Mistake No. 2: Pruning Shrubs
Pruning causes plants to produce new growth, which is tender and highly vulnerable to freezing temperatures. Wait to prune shrubs, including butterfly bush and caryopteris, until spring when all danger of frost has passed. At that point you can remove any winter-killed branches. In future years, aim to get pruning done by late August so plants have time to harden off before freezes arrive.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 3: Ignoring Slugs
One of the best times to tackle slug control is in fall when mature slugs come out to lay eggs. Apply slug bait in areas where you know there’s a problem, or go out at night with a flashlight to deal with slugs you spot. It’s easy to handpick slugs (wearing gloves, of course!) and toss them into a bucket of soapy water to die. Also remove any debris from planting beds that might provide a hiding place for these munching machines.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 4: Planting the Wrong Varieties
Fall lettuce crops can linger well into December in mild winter areas. Plant cold-tolerant varieties to ensure the longest harvest period. Good choices for fall planting include ‘Four Seasons’ lettuce (shown), ‘Arctic King’ and ‘North Pole.’ To overwinter lettuce in regions with cold winters, plant ‘Winter Marvel’ or ‘Brune d’Hiver.’ In mild winter areas, sow seeds of ‘Four Seasons’ or any oakleaf type.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 5: Forgetting to Take Cuttings
Take cuttings of plants that aren’t hardy enough to survive your region’s winter. Good candidates include Mexican bush sage, mints, coleus, pineapple sage, polka dot plant and many others. Most, like this plectranthus, root easily in water and can be tucked into pots later. Others, like scented geraniums, grow best when dipped in rooting hormone powder and stuck directly into soil to root.
Mistake No. 6: Not Watering New Trees
Trees that you plant in fall need consistent watering as they enter their first winter. If winter brings frozen soil without snow, give your tree a drink whenever you have above-freezing temperatures. One hose-less way to ferry water to a tree is with a water bag in a cart.
Mistake No. 7: Failing to Deadhead Self-Sowers
Plants that self-sow aggressively in the landscape can be beautiful in bloom but a gardener’s nightmare if allowed to go to seed. Clip seedheads on plants that tend to self-sow heavily in your garden. Good candidates include Joe-Pye weed, goldenrod, boltonia and black-eyed Susans.
Mistake No. 8: Not Bringing Plants Inside
Once night temperatures stay below 50 degree F to 55 degree F, it’s a good idea to shift potted houseplants indoors for winter. The same rule applies to non-hardy potted plants you plan to overwinter indoors, even in a dormant state. Keep an eye on weather forecasts for unexpected early-season snows. A few hours of the lightest snow on a tropical plant can kill leaves. Even this cool-loving fuchsia suffers damage when covered with snow.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 9: Skipping Mulch
A winter mulch can be a gardener’s best friend, especially around new additions to the landscape. That extra mulch layer can help prevent frost heave around new plants that may not have an extensive root system to help keep them anchored in soil as it freezes and thaws. Put a 2-inch-thick layer around the base of plants to insulate roots.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 10: Spraying for Weeds
Be sure to read the label of your favorite weed killer. For common chemicals like Round-Up, 50°F is usually the lowest temperature where the product remains effective at killing weeds. Many plants essentially stop growing as soil temperatures fall into the 50-degree range, so at that point spraying is a waste of time and money. The answer is to spray early in the fall season while plants are actively growing and air temps are still in the ideal 60-degree range.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 11: No Pre-Snow Clean-Up
In snowy winter climates, aim to clean up the garden before early snowfalls arrive. Doing this helps to reduce winter resting places for pests and diseases that go into hiding once snow flies. It’s also easier on you — no frozen fingers.
Mistake No. 12: Not Destroying Veggie Crops
It’s vital to destroy spent vegetable crops, especially those that hosted problem pests, like Mexican bean beetles. Don’t toss these plants into a compost pile unless you know it heats enough to destroy pests and eggs. It’s safer to dispose of infested plants and fallen leaves in bags you put at the curb for garbage pick up.
Mistake No. 13: Letting Hoses Freeze
Before night temperatures drop to freezing, remove all hose-end attachments, including watering wands and nozzles. Detach hoses from hose bibs, and close any interior shut-off valves along exterior water supply lines. Drain hoses by running them out to their full length from a hose reel or other holder. It works best if you can let one end run along an incline so when you rewind the hose, the water flows out naturally with gravity. Store irrigation gear in a garage or shed.
Mistake No. 14: Failing to Use Frost Blankets
If you have a garden that’s actively producing when frost threatens, there’s no excuse for not investing in some season-extending equipment to keep the fresh flavors — and nutrition — coming into your kitchen. This kit costs less than $25 and comes with built-in hoops and the ability to extend up to 18 feet.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 15: Ditching a Final Mow
In snowy regions, grass that goes into winter without being mowed is more prone to develop snow mold. Try to give grass one last cut before winter snows arrive. Also, once the ground freezes, stay off the lawn. Frozen grass is more prone to breaking as you walk on it, which can damage individual grass crowns.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 16: Letting Leaves Pile Up
If you allow leaves to stay on grass over winter, you’ll likely find dead lawn patches in spring. Use a leaf vac to chop leaves into smaller pieces that make a terrific mulch on planting beds and vegetable gardens, or add them to your compost pile. Mowing over leaves is another easy way to downsize them. Catch the chopped leaves with a bag attachment, or just let them lie in place to help nourish the lawn.
Get More Tips
Mistake No. 17: Not Wrapping Vulnerable Shrubs
Take time to wrap shrubs and small trees with a winter coat of burlap for protection against cold temps. Plants at risk include those with borderline hardiness and evergreens prone to winter burn. Spray evergreens with an anti-transpirant (which helps reduce moisture loss) before wrapping in burlap. Before adding the burlap, protect trunks against chewing rodents by tossing mouse bait that’s enclosed in a protective container near the base of the plant.
Mistake No. 18: Failing to Protect Trunks
As food sources become scarce, rabbits, mice and voles can make quick work of bark on unprotected trees and shrubs. Use tree guards around young tree trunks, and surround shrubs with hardware mesh. You can also try to attract raptors like owls and hawks, which prey on these mammals, by erecting artificial perch poles.
Mistake No. 19: Ignoring Tall Shrubs
In general, it’s best not to prune shrubs in fall, as noted in Mistake No. 2. But if you garden in a region known for heavy snows and ice storms, it’s wise to prune reliably winter hardy, tall shrubs that you normally cut back hard in early spring. This includes things like Knock Out roses, panicle hydrangeas and smooth hydrangeas. After a hard freeze, cut these plants back by roughly one-third to reduce height. This will help limit damage from storms with hefty precipitation that can snap tall branches. Prune the remaining stem length in late winter/early spring.
Mistake No. 20: Giving Voles a Safe Space
In spring, if you typically find vole trails like these in your lawn as the snow melts, take steps before the snow flies to shift the critters away from turf. Voles chew pathways through grass roots to hide from predators when there’s steady snow cover. Apply a castor oil-based repellent like Mole Max to lawns or flower beds well before snow arrives to send voles packing. Follow package instructions carefully, and make another application in known problem areas right before the first snowfall.

Winter’s first major storm set to hit the eastern US with heavy rain and significant snow,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/02/weather/snow-winter-storm-northeast-climate/index.html,"Winter’s first major storm set to hit the eastern US with heavy rain and significant snow

This is an outdated forecast. Click here for the latest version.
A major winter storm is setting up to thrash much of the eastern US this weekend with heavy rain, strong winds and the first significant snow of the season.
As of Thursday morning, the highest confidence for significant snow was in portions of the interior Northeast, including central Pennsylvania and southeastern New York state, and southern and central New England.
That means cities like Washington, DC, Baltimore and New York – all waiting nearly two years for an inch of snow in a calendar day – could miss out on snow and instead experience more rain, a mix of wintry precipitation, or both.

Regardless of the storm’s final snow totals, an impactful winter storm capable of disrupting travel is coming this weekend. It’s coming from an active Pacific storm track typical of an El Niño winter, which is sending a series of storms across the US into next week.
The system responsible for the potential winter weather will first cross the southern half of the US through Friday, before swooping up the East through the weekend.
In much of the South and Southeast this will mean a cool rain as the storm taps into ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana and Mississippi, still suffering from drought after a summer of extreme heat and a lack of rain, are in the bull’s-eye for what would be largely beneficial rain.
Rain will begin Thursday evening in central Texas and progress with the storm’s track to the east, overrunning the Southeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic with time. This storm could cause flooding issues in the South, particularly in areas drenched earlier in the week, but its quick-moving nature should limit the potential for repeated rounds of rain.
The storm will then drive north into the mid-Atlantic Saturday dumping heavy rain and freezing rain on parts of the southern Appalachians and Piedmont. The main event for snow in the Northeast will be Saturday night and Sunday as the storm tracks through the area and then off the coast.
Strong winds are also possible, the exact magnitude of which in specific areas will also rely on the storm’s track and intensity.

Where is the ice? Great Lakes ice cover is nearly non-existent and reaches 50-year record low,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/03/us/great-lakes-ice-cover-climate/index.html,"Where is the ice? Great Lakes ice cover is nearly non-existent and reaches 50-year record low
Follow:
A warm start to the winter season has left the Great Lakes virtually ice-free and with their lowest ice cover to kick off a new year in at least 50 years.
On New Year’s Day, only 0.35% of the Great Lakes were covered in ice, the lowest on record for the date, and well below the historical average of nearly 10% for this point in winter, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL).
This year’s missing ice in the Great Lakes adds to a growing trend of winter ailments plaguing the US, from dwindling snowpacks in the West to an ongoing snow drought in the Northeast, all becoming more common due to warming temperatures from the climate crisis.
Since record-keeping began in 1973, researchers have found the Great Lakes have been experiencing a massive decline in ice, with the peak coverage dropping by about 5% each decade.
“It’s certainly very low for this time of year,” James Kessler, a physical scientist at NOAA’s GLERL, told CNN.
The year’s most extreme weather shows what a warming planet is capable of, and what’s to come
Air temperature matters when it comes to ice cover on the Great Lakes, said Kessler. Cold air is needed to cool the water so the lakes can freeze. But with the climate rapidly heating up, records show warmer than average temperatures in the region are melting the chances for Great Lakes ice to form.
“We’ve had consistently above average air temperature in the region, and we haven’t had consistently cold days,” Kessler said. “That’s really what you need. You need a consistent number of days below freezing.”
Average December temperatures in the Upper Midwest states surrounding the Great Lakes soared 8 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the month. It was the warmest December on record for several cities along the Great Lakes, including Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota.
It was a similar story on the eastern side of the lakes as well, with Cleveland; Erie, Pennsylvania, and Buffalo, New York, all seeing one of the warmest Decembers on record. As a result, Lake Erie is currently completely ice-free.
It’s an ongoing trend. Lake Erie has seen a decline in ice coverage of about 5% each decade, according to Kessler, while Lake Superior is seeing the most rapid rate of ice cover loss of about 7% every 10 years. Recent studies have shown that Lake Superior is among the fastest warming lakes in the world, thanks to planet-heating pollution.
It is still early in the season, Kessler cautioned. One prolonged blast of Arctic air in the coming weeks could cause ice coverage to increase exponentially. And peak ice in the Great Lakes typically occurs in late February or early March.
Kessler said that while there is year-to-year variability, the Great Lakes are trending toward a future with less ice cover.
“First of all, (the data) is very noisy,” Kessler said. “But if you fit a trend line to this data, you do get a decreasing trend, so we do see that (ice cover) is going down.”
Low ice cover in the Great Lakes has serious ramifications for industries and the environment.
Less ice could extend shipping season. Shipments by water along the Great Lakes could grow with the ice-free waters giving way to more vessels, according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Superior looking into how reduced ice cover could directly affect navigation there.
“The commercial shipping industry is like a multibillion-dollar industry, and so less ice cover is good for them,” Kessler said. “Often, the freighters get stuck when it’s a high year, and the US Coast Guard has to go rescue them and it’s a huge undertaking. So, from that perspective, low ice is good economically.”
On the flip side, he said there’s also an economic benefit when the lakes are frozen: coastal towns benefit through recreational activities such as ice fishing competitions or ice hockey games.
Ice cover also protects the shorelines of the lakes. Without it, high waves can cause severe flooding, coastline erosion and damage. A dearth of ice coverage can also lead to more severe snowstorms like the one that paralyzed Buffalo, New York, and surrounding towns in 2022, Kessler said.
When very cold, windy conditions form over an unfrozen lake, it sets the stage for “lake-effect” snow. And the Great Lakes are the only place in the US where this phenomenon occurs, except occasionally at the Great Salt Lake in Utah.
Kessler said that while the first couple days of January have been notable for low ice cover on the Great Lakes, daily lows are not as significant as month-long lows.
“If the month of January as a whole is on average lower than past Januarys, that will be more remarkable to me,” he said.
It’s impossible to know exactly how the rest of winter’s temperatures will play out around the Great Lakes. But a strong El Niño winter like this year’s typically means a greater chance for warmer than average temperatures there, meaning it could continue to be an uphill battle for the lakes’ ice.

In the hottest year on record, the fingerprints of a changing climate in a warming world were all over dozens of extreme weather events.
There wouldn’t be weather without heat; heat is energy, and weather is an expression of that energy, of an atmosphere trying to balance itself. But too much heat in the system raises the limits of what is possible in weather and pushes it toward the extremes.
So it’s maybe no surprise then that this year’s record heat was a “through line” in many of 2023’s most brutal weather events, Kristina Dahl, climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.
“Climate change influences our weather on Earth every day,” Dahl said. “In my mind, the burden of proof now is to show that climate change hasn’t influenced an event, because it’s just so clearly influencing everything around us.”
The extreme weather events of this year are not unique – they’re a sign of what’s to come.
“These types of events will continue to become more frequent and more severe if we continue to warm the planet,” Dahl said.
These are just a few of 2023’s most notable examples of what a warming planet’s extreme weather can look like.
Off-the-charts rapid intensification
Record heat wasn’t just in the air, it made it to the oceans too, which absorb most of Earth’s excess heat.
“Sea surface temperatures were just so much warmer than they have been in any previous year on record,” Dahl said.
Warm water acts like food for storms, and the exceptionally warm ocean water in 2023 not only created more storms in the Atlantic by neutralizing the storm-dampening effects of a strengthening El Niño, but also fueled explosive strengthening of the storms that formed across the globe.
This explosive strengthening, known as rapid intensification, is becoming more likely as the atmosphere warms.
A combined 12 tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and East Pacific basins rapidly intensified in 2023.
Lee was the strongest Atlantic hurricane this season and maxed out as a rare Category 5 hurricane in the open ocean in September after its winds strengthened by a staggering 85 mph in 24 hours. The outburst made Lee the Atlantic’s third-fastest rapidly intensifying storm on record.
Idalia, the only hurricane to make landfall in the US this year, was yet another example of the more frequent rapid intensification of storms right before landfall.
The storm briefly reached Category 4 status before slamming Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 3 hurricane – the strongest storm to hit there in more than 125 years.
The East Pacific’s Hurricane Otis was the most extreme example of rapid strengthening in either basin this year. Otis’s winds increased by an astounding 115 mph in the 24 hours before its devastating Category 5 landfall in Acapulco, Mexico, in October.
Otis was the strongest Pacific storm to ever strike Mexico and came just two weeks after Category 4 Hurricane Lidia – also a rapid intensifier – made landfall just south of Puerto Vallarta as another one of Pacific Mexico’s strongest storms.
Rapid intensification also helped Hurricane Hilary maintain enough strength to track across California as a tropical storm – the state’s first since 1997. Hilary unloaded a deluge that broke tropical rainfall records in a few states and caused extreme flooding that lingered for months in one of the driest places on Earth.
A historic tragedy in a year of unusual wildfire behavior
Unusual wildfire behavior marked the year, both in where fires started and where they didn’t.
Wildfires typically burn 7 to 8 million acres of land each year in the US, but only charred 2.6 million acres in 2023, National Interagency Fire Center statistics show.
This was due in part to a soaking start to the year in the typically fiery West, which kept wildfires to a minimum after years of destruction. One season a trend does not make, and as the world warms, wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe – particularly in the West, the latest National Climate Assessment notes.
Still, the season proved deadly and destructive as intense heat combined with a lack of rain to dry out soil and leave typically wet parts of the US and much of Canada vulnerable to fire.
Tragedy struck Hawaii’s island of Maui in August in the form of the blazing Lahaina inferno.
Wind-driven flames surged so quickly through drought-parched invasive grasses, engulfing everything in their path, that some people fleeing for their lives had no choice but to jump into the Pacific Ocean. Many could not escape, and the Lahaina Fire became the deadliest on US soil in more than 100 years.
Louisiana is one of the wettest states in the US, but after a summer of endless heat, no tropical systems and little rain, the ground turned to tinder. The tremendous dryness peaked in November when 75% of the state was under exceptional drought – the most expansive such area in state history.
The state endured one of its worst fire seasons in recent decades as a result, according to data provided to CNN by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Fires in the southern half of the state kept burning into the fall and their smoke fueled “super fog” that caused a fiery, deadly pileup near New Orleans.
Fires also affected much of the US, even when they weren’t burning there.
Canada’s worst wildfire season on record burned an area roughly the size of North Dakota and sent plumes of toxic smoke from its numerous massive fires into the US and all the way to Europe.
The smoke blocked out the sun and sent air quality levels plummeting in June across the Northeast. Apocalyptic, orange skies engulfed New York City as the city briefly had the worst air pollution levels in the world.
The hottest month for any US city in a summer of ‘heat hell’
Heat records were shattered this summer across the Northern Hemisphere, including much of the US. In the US, a series of heat domes roasted the southern and central parts of the country.
The heat index topped 130 degrees in Kansas, New Orleans hit its highest temperature ever recorded – 105 degrees – and much of Texas and Florida baked under exceptionally prolonged extreme heat.
But one city was emblematic of an extreme summer with heat scientists said was “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change: Phoenix.
July in Phoenix was the hottest month on record for any US city. The city’s average temperature for the month clocked in at an astonishing 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit following brutally hot days and record-warm nights.
Phoenix endured an unprecedented 31 consecutive days with high temperatures at or exceeding 110 degrees.
The heat took a punishing toll.
At least 579 people died in 2023 of heat-related causes in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, in what was the deadliest year for heat there since the county began tracking in 2003.
Days where high temperatures exceed 100 degrees are becoming more common across many major US cities as global temperatures rise, but Phoenix has seen the biggest increase of them all. The city averages 18 more days above 100 degrees each year compared to historic averages. That translates to about 111 days above 100 degrees each year.
Supercharged flooding kills thousands
Storm Daniel brought deadly flooding to Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria in September before moving over the Mediterranean Sea and taking aim at Libya. Charged by the warm waters of the Mediterranean, Daniel became a “medicane” – a storm with similar characteristics to hurricanes and typhoons.
The storm unleashed torrential rainfall across Libya and one city recorded 16 inches of rain in just 24 hours. Horrific flooding unfolded as a result, killing an estimated 4,000 people.
The city of Derna was hardest hit. The flooding there burst two dams and unleashed a massive wave of water which swept away much of the city’s core.
The World Weather Attribution initiative – a team of scientists that analyze the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events – found planet-warming pollution made the deadly rainfall in Libya up to 50 times more likely and 50% worse.
A medicane or even a tropical system isn’t necessary to unleash devastating flooding in a warming world. As the atmosphere continues to warm it’s able to soak up more moisture like a towel and then ring it out in the form of more extreme gushes of flooding rainfall.
This scenario played out multiple times in the US: A train of deadly atmospheric rivers pummeled California in January and March; catastrophic July flooding turned Vermont’s capital city of Montpelier into a raging river and turned deadly in upstate New York; and a month’s worth of rain fell in a matter of hours in New York City in September, sending feet of floodwater surging through parts of the city.

A new rule requiring companies to disclose how much they pollute is coming in 2024
The Securities and Exchange Commission will decide by next spring on a rule to make public companies disclose how much they generate in greenhouse gases and how climate change could hurt their businesses.
The rule, which comes amid the Biden administration’s efforts to tackle climate change, has been met with backlash from business leaders and lawmakers who argue that it oversteps the SEC’s mission to safeguard investors and regulate markets.
“Congress created the SEC to carry out the mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation—not to advance progressive climate policies,” a group of Republican lawmakers wrote in a letter to the agency earlier this year.
Advocates say that in an age of expanding climate-related regulations, investors deserve to know the growing financial risks that some companies face from climate change ­– and laws curbing emissions – before deciding to invest.
What’s in the rule
The SEC first proposed its climate disclosure rule in March 2022, but since then, the agency has delayed releasing a final version on multiple occasions.
The proposal requires companies to share information on two forms of climate change risk: physical and transition risks.
Physical risks refer to climate change’s impact on a company’s operations, including the hazards of increased natural disasters like wildfires or hurricanes.
Transition risks refer in part to potential damage to a company’s profits due to a growing number of climate change regulations. As a result, the SEC rule would order companies to share pollution generated by their business operations, broken up into three categories: scope 1, 2 and 3.
Scope 1 and 2 are direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions produced as a company conducts its business, such as waste produced by a manufacturing process or how much air conditioning is used in an office building.
Scope 3 refers to emissions that a company is indirectly responsible for, meaning they are not produced by the company but are created as a result of its product.
Consider an oil company: While it may have relatively low scope 1 and 2 emissions, the thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide produced by gas-powered vehicles would be factored into its Scope 3 emissions, despite the fact that the oil companies do not produce cars.
Because scope 3 emissions occur outside of a company’s control, “it’s very challenging to gather all of that information,” said Rob Fisher, KPMG’s US ESG, or environmental, social and governance, leader.
In a recent fireside chat hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce, SEC Chair Gary Gensler acknowledged that businesses have expressed “questions and doubts and concerns” about measuring scope 3 emissions.
“But what investors have told us in the comments that they’ve sent us is that understanding the emissions of a company’s supply chain helps understand what’s called transition risk. You know, what might be the future of that business,” Gensler said.
Separate rules from Europe and California
The SEC’s delay hasn’t stopped other regulators from taking pollution disclosures into their own hands.
In October, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a climate disclosure bill requiring private and public companies that do business in California to disclose scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions beginning in 2026.
California’s bill comes after Europe passed its own rule, called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. It forces certain companies that do business in Europe to publish information on environmental and social matters. That rule took effect in January 2023.
The combination of those two rules means that many large US companies will likely disclose climate emissions, with or without the SEC’s rule, Fisher said. “The mandatory reporting wave is already underway.”
A contentious proposal
The SEC’s proposed rule has elicited strong reactions – both positive and negative ­– from lawmakers, business leaders and academics.
Critics argue that the rule will have unintended consequences on the overall economy.
A comment submitted to the SEC by Matthew Winden, an associate dean of the University of Wisconsin Whitewater’s College of Business, argued that the cost of measuring emissions will be greater than the SEC anticipates. Companies could pass those cost increases onto customers through higher prices or onto employees through fewer raises or wage reductions, Winden argued.
Republican lawmakers have also argued that the rule is “outside the scope” of the SEC’s mission and, “if finalized in any form, will unnecessarily harm consumers, workers, and the U.S. economy,” according to a letter from three GOP members of the House.
However, the rule has drawn strong support from Democratic officials. A March letter to the SEC signed by Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin, urged the SEC to “fulfill its duty to investors and follow through on finalizing a strong climate disclosure rule without delay.”
Gensler addressed criticisms at the fireside chat, saying that though the SEC is not a climate regulator, many companies already disclose part of their climate emissions and make promises regarding emissions and waste. Investors should have a standardized way to analyze those reports, he said.
“Hundreds and hundreds of companies ­– 81% of the Russell 1000 (index) ­– are making climate disclosures, and investors are making decisions,” Gensler said. “Investors really do want some rule.”
Fisher of KPMG said the rule would help rein in companies who “write their own rubric and grade their own papers” regarding environmental promises and disclosures.

This beloved New Year’s Eve ‘pop’ could soon disappear because of changing weather,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/climate/new-year-champagne-weather-threat-climate/index.html,"This beloved New Year’s Eve ‘pop’ could soon disappear because of changing weather
Follow:
As the new year approaches, you might be thinking about buying a bottle of champagne to ring it in with a celebratory “pop.” But the climate crisis could ruin the party, new data suggests.
The three grapes used in almost all champagne — chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier — are among hundreds on the brink of extinction, according to Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi, which shared data insights with CNN. That’s because the human-caused climate crisis is warming and altering weather patterns in some of the world’s best-known wine-growing regions, including Champagne in northern France.
By 2050, these popular grape varieties may cease to exist, ClimateAi says. Using hundreds of global climate models, satellite data and field data, ClimateAi researchers are able to forecast the future of grapes used to make champagne and sparkling wine around the world.
A study published in 2020 warned that the number of regions currently growing wine grapes will shrink by more than half if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world will breach that threshold this century if deeper, sustained cuts to carbon pollution aren’t made soon, according to the UN Environment Programme. At 4 degrees of warming, up to 85% of these lands would no longer be viable to produce a decent drop.
After a terrible year of climate news, here are 5 reasons to feel positive
“If we think about champagne specifically, it’s a very unique beverage,” said Will Kletter, vice president of operations and strategy at ClimateAi. “It requires warm, sunny days for robust flavor and cool nights to build up that acidity, which gives it that kind of crisp, refreshing taste that that we love.”
He added: “But as the climate warms, those warm sunny days can get maybe a bit too warm, and those cool nights go away.”
Global wine production in 2023 was at its lowest in 60 years. A lot of that decline was because of extreme weather events, many of which have been worsened by climate change, according to an annual wine production report by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), published in November. Italy dropped from its position as the world’s leading wine maker due to several adverse weather events, including erratic rainfall that triggered downy mildew, as well as floods, hailstorms and drought, the report said.
“This is very much a now problem,” Kletter told CNN. “That means more expensive wine, or maybe the wine that’s produced is not of the same quality, and maybe you can’t even access some of the wines that you’re used to enjoying. And that’s a problem that we’re facing today.”
At the pace at which the planet is warming, Kletter said wine growers need to start learning how to adapt — and potentially keep an eye out for viable, cooler locations further north — to keep the industry alive and growing.
In France’s Champagne region, wine growers in 2021 saw their smallest harvest since 1957 due to extreme weather events, from extreme heat to early frosting, as well as heavy rainfall, according to a Reuters report. This cost France a total of roughly $2 billion in sales, the report said.
But France has had a decent production year in 2023, producing well in the north, including in Champagne, the OIV report said, even though some vineyards in the south were hit with downy mildew, heat waves and drought.
How wineries are adapting
Dave and Lois Cho moved from California to Oregon’s Willamette Valley to start a winery in 2020, a particularly challenging year as the western US faced a historic, multi-year drought that triggered unprecedented water shortages and land-scarring wildfires.
“Climate change definitely was a factor,” Lois told CNN, when explaining why the couple left. The pair, who founded CHO Wines, initially looked at different wine-making regions in California but heard from growers of having difficulties with erratic rainfall patterns to irrigate their grapes.
They were determined to find a site with high elevation. That’s because a vineyard higher up will be cooler and receive more rain. It also means that grapes won’t ripen too early, as they do in the heat, allowing for more flavor and acidity to develop.
The climate crisis is coming for your hoppy beer
“Being up at 1,000-feet elevation, which is a pretty high elevation for a lot of valleys still, that was a huge consideration,” Dave told CNN. “Now, we are on average five to 10 degrees cooler than the valley floor, so we thought that would buy us some time (to fully adapt to the crisis).”
The wine industry uses a metric called growing degree days to measure how much heat is accumulating through the growing season and helps determine the speed at which grapes redeveloping. The Chos say the number of those “days” are rising, which accelerates the grapes’ ripening and pushes harvest seasons earlier.
As the West gets hotter and drier, many US wine producers like the Chos see Oregon’s Willamette Valley — roughly a nine-hour drive north of the famous wine-growing Napa Valley in California — as the country’s next major wine region.
“It’s like a moving train. If you’re trying to jump on a moving train, it’s really difficult,” Lois Cho said. “But in Oregon, it’s like we’re laying down the tracks, because there’s a lot of undeveloped land and untapped resources.”
Opportunity for new flavor
One of the questions for the wine industry now is whether traditional wine growers are willing to shift away from their regions and adopt new winemaking processes. ClimateAi’s Kletter said major wine producers need to consider whether there are emerging areas and opportunities to develop new vineyards and new flavors.
“That’s the wine adaptation playbook,” said Kletter, who once lived in France and is a huge sparkling wine fan. “I think this is actually an exciting opportunity for businesses and potentially consumers to get access to tasty wines that they may have never experienced before.”
But that’s challenging for regions like Bordeaux and Champagne in France, which are bound to their territories. By law, to be considered authentic “champagne,” the wine must come from the Champagne region. That’s why in other countries, including the US, similar drinks are called “sparkling wine.”
But for the Chos, their move to Oregon has inspired experimentation. In 2022, they co-fermented their grapes with apples to create a new flavor to their sparkling wine. It’s become quite a popular product among their 2022 wines, Lois Cho said.
“You can’t live in fear,” Dave Cho said. “There’s an opportunity for us to be creative.”"

There has been no shortage of bleak climate news this year: unprecedented global heat fueled deadly extreme weather events, scientists issued dire warnings that next year may be worse still, and the world’s carbon pollution kept rising.
But amid the gloom, there have also been signs of progress. Renewable energy records have been set, the world celebrated one of its greatest environmental wins and countries made a cautious but historic step towards a fossil fuel-free future.
Here are five reasons to be hopeful.
A surge in renewable energy
As the need to rapidly wean off planet-heating fossil fuels becomes increasingly urgent, there have been some clean energy bright spots around the world.
On Halloween, Portugal started a record-breaking streak. For more than six days straight, between October 31 to November 6, the nation of more than 10 million people relied solely on renewable energy sources — setting an exciting example for the rest of the world.
The year 2023 is on track to see the biggest increase in renewable energy capacity to date, according to the International Energy Agency.
China, the world’s biggest climate polluter, has made lightning advances in renewables, with the country set to shatter its wind and solar target five years early. A report published in June found that China’s solar capacity is now greater than the rest of the world’s nations combined, in a surge described by the report’s author, Global Energy Monitor, as “jaw-dropping.”
It can’t be ignored, however, that China also ramped up its coal production this year, turning to the fossil fuel as devastating heat waves increased energy demand for air conditioning and cooling, and as persistent drought in the country’s south impacted hydroelectric supplies, which are reliant on sufficient rainfall.
Hopes were raised that the country’s coal production will peak and come down soon, when China and the US in November announced they would resume cooperation on climate change, pledging a major ramp-up of renewable energy, specifically to replace fossil fuels.
A climate deal that targets fossil fuels
After more than two weeks of fraught negotiations, the COP28 climate summit in Dubai concluded in December with nearly 200 countries making an unprecedented commitment to move away from fossil fuels.
While the agreement fell short of requiring the world to phase out coal, oil and gas — which more than 100 countries had supported — it did call on countries to “contribute” to a “transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems.” This marked the first time that all fossil fuels, the main drivers of the climate crisis, were targeted in a COP agreement.
COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who presided over the negotiations, called the agreement “historic,” adding that the deal represented “a paradigm shift that has the potential to redefine our economies.”
How impactful this deal ultimately is will depend on what countries do next to implement it. Many experts warned of loopholes that could leave the door open to a continued expansion of fossil fuels.
But that a deal was struck at all on fossil fuels was widely welcomed seen as a breakthrough.
“We got people to do things they haven’t done before,” US climate envoy John Kerry told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour after the summit, describing it as a “historic success.”
Plummeting deforestation in Brazil
After years of soaring deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, there was good progress this year in reducing forest destruction.
The Amazon is the world’s biggest rainforest and its protection is seen as vital to curbing climate change. It acts a carbon sink that sucks in planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere. When forests or trees are destroyed, they emit greenhouse gases. Deforestation and land degradation is responsible for at least one-tenth of the world’s carbon pollution.
Deforestation in Brazil fell by 22.3% in the 12 months through July, according to data from the national government, as President Luiz Ignácio Lula da Silva started to make progress on his pledge to rein in the rampant forest destruction that occurred under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.
Marcio Astrini, head of advocacy group Climate Observatory, described it as an “impressive result” that “seals Brazil’s return to the climate agenda.”
Still, Brazil’s deforestation rate remained nearly twice that of its all-time low in 2012. Around 9,000 square kilometers of rainforest were destroyed in the period. There’s a long way to go to meet Lula’s pledge to reach zero deforestation by 2030.
The ozone layer is healing well
The Earth’s ozone layer is on track to recover completely within decades, a UN-backed panel of experts announced in January, as ozone-depleting chemicals are phased out across the world.
The ozone layer protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays, but since the 1980s, scientists have warned about a hole in this shield due to ozone-harming substances, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were used widely in refrigerators, aerosols and solvents.
International cooperation has helped stem the damage. A deal known as the Montreal Protocol, which came into force in 1989, began the phase-out of CFCs. The ozone layer’s subsequent recovery has been hailed as one of the world’s greatest environmental achievements.
If global policies stay in place, the ozone layer is expected to recover to 1980 levels by 2040 for most of the world, the assessment found. For polar areas, the timeframe for recovery is longer: 2045 over the Arctic and 2066 over the Antarctic.
A study published in November, however, cast some doubt on this progress. The paper, published by Nature Communications, found that a hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic “has not only remained large in area, but it has also become deeper throughout most of the Antarctic spring.” But some scientists were skeptical of the study’s findings, saying it relied on too short a time period to draw conclusions about the layer’s long-term health.
Electric vehicle sales surge
The popularity of electric vehicles has surged this year, with American sales at an all-time high. People in China and Europe are snapping up EVs in large numbers as well.
Electric vehicles — which are better for the planet than gas and diesel-powered cars when they run on renewable energy sources — are key to decarbonizing road transport, which is responsible for around one-sixth of planet-heating pollution globally, according to the International Energy Agency.
Americans purchased 1 million fully electric vehicles in 2023, an annual record, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Electric vehicles accounted for about 8% of all new vehicles sales in the US during the first half of 2023, according to the report. In China, EVs accounted for 19% of all vehicle sales, and worldwide, they made up 15% of new passenger vehicle sales.
EV sales in Europe were up 47% in the first nine months of 2023, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (EAMA). However, car dealers have warned that sales are dropping off as consumers wait for cheaper models, expected in two to three years’ time."
The weather most likely to ruin your flight plans,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/22/weather/why-flights-get-canceled-weather-climate/index.html,"The weather most likely to ruin your flight plans
Follow:
Chances are, you can blame the weather if your flight plans get upended during the holiday travel rush.
Weather is the largest cause of air traffic troubles in the US and accounts for 75% of all reported delays, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
But not all weather is created equal when it comes to flight disruptions. Here are the four types of weather most likely to change up your itinerary, ordered from least to most-likely, according to Kyle Struckmann, the head aviation meteorologist for the National Weather Service.
4. Wild winds
Both wind speed and wind direction are critical for safe takeoffs and landings.
“Airplanes ideally land and take off directly into the wind,” Struckmann told CNN.
Headwinds give a plane the lift and stability necessary for smooth takeoffs and landings. Without them, planes run the risk of not getting off the ground or landing too fast.
Airport runways are ideally built to run in the same direction as the airport’s most common wind direction, according to the FAA. This allows aircraft to take off and land into the wind more often.
Strong crosswinds – winds that blow across an airplane’s path, rather than toward its nose or tail – can cause tricky or aborted landings by forcing the aircraft to approach the runway at an angle to counterbalance the winds’ force and land level.
Crosswinds are a frequent cause of rough landings, Struckmann said. In a more extreme scenario, planes can miss the runway entirely.
One such landing played out in California during Tropical Storm Hilary in August. A passenger jet came in for a landing off-kilter during poor weather conditions and struck its left wing on the runway as scared, but unharmed, passengers watched sparks fly.
Busy airports have alternate runways for when the wind direction is not ideal, but alternate runways are often shorter and accommodate fewer planes, according to Struckmann.
Fewer landings mean longer flight times for planes waiting to land and longer wait times for passengers at the gate waiting for their plane to arrive.
3. Low visibility
Many different types of weather, including dense fog, heavy rainfall with low clouds, and heavy snow, can drop visibility to near-zero and frequently cause delayed takeoffs and landings.
Even though pilots use instrumentation to fly safely through clouds when they cannot see, good old-fashioned eyesight is still a necessary fail-safe near a runway.
Different airports have different requirements, but to land, pilots need to be able to see enough of the runway to note potential hazards instrumentation may not be able to detect as quickly, according to Struckmann.
These potential hazards include other aircraft being where they’re not expected to be.
In January, two airliners nearly collided at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport after one crossed onto an active runway. Two other near misses happened in the following weeks in Honolulu and Austin, Texas.
2. Snow and ice
Snow and ice is one of the most frequent weather hazards from late fall through winter and causes serious issues for planes on the ground and in the air.
On the ground, the focus is on clearing runways of slick snow to allow planes to safely grip the surface during takeoffs and landings.
In the air, it’s all about keeping ice from accumulating on planes.
“When you have ice accumulating on wings, it really significantly affects a plane’s performance,” Struckmann said.
When ice gathers on an aircraft, it can distort the flow of air over the wings – disrupting the lift that keeps planes in the air – and make a plane heavier. Too much ice can cause an airplane to roll or maneuver uncontrollably, according to the FAA.
Clouds are made up of water droplets. These droplets can freeze and cause ice to accumulate on a plane when it flies through clouds at a height where temperatures are below freezing.
“If planes have to descend through [freezing conditions] then ideally the plane needs to move through it as fast as possible to get down to a lower altitude where it’s above freezing,” Struckmann explained.
Back on the ground, deicing clears any ice or snow build up off a plane so it can operate safely. This process can delay takeoffs, but it beats not being able to lift off at all or losing control mid-flight.
1. Thunderstorms
While more common in spring and summer, the holiday season is not immune to thunderstorms. A secondary severe weather season develops in November and December due to the clash of still-warm air from the Gulf of Mexico with very chilly air diving south out of Canada.
The resulting thunderstorms are “very dangerous” for air travel, Struckmann said. This is due to the “severe turbulence caused by updrafts, downdrafts, winds and hail.”
Thunderstorms contain both updrafts and downdrafts, fast-moving columns of air that rush up into the atmosphere and down toward the surface, respectively. These quickly-changing winds create severe turbulence and, in addition to hail and lightning, can batter an aircraft in flight.
NTSB opens investigation into turbulence incident on Delta flight that injured 12
Turbulence can cause a bumpy ride, severe shaking and sudden drops that can lead to injuries. At its worst, turbulence can hinder a plane’s ability to fly by altering its speed or altitude and even cause it to crash, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
To avoid damage and potential passenger injuries, planes typically take a longer flight plan that travels around – rather than through – thunderstorms to avoid the hazards found within the disruptive storms. This leads to more time spent in the air and later arrivals back on the ground, which may delay subsequent flights.
During the spring, flying earlier in the day before thunderstorms rumble to life in the heat of the afternoon can help avoid delays."

Follow:
Winter is here, but for most of the United States, it’s feeling less and less like it.
At 10:27 p.m. ET on Thursday, Earth’s Northern Hemisphere will be at its greatest tilt from the sun, marking the winter solstice: the shortest day of the year and the official start of the coldest season.
But winter is warming rapidly because of human-caused climate change and it’s having an impact on snow, tourism, winter sports, local economies, dinner plates and even allergies.
The winter period from December to February is now the fastest-warming of the three-month seasons for nearly 75% of the US, according to an analysis of NOAA temperature data by Climate Central, a nonprofit climate research group.
The analysis looked at average winter temperatures for 240 locations across the US and found the winter warming trend covers every corner of the map — temperatures had warmed in 97%, or 233, of the spots since 1970.
Winter temperatures increased by 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1970 in these warming locations. Winters in the fastest-warming cities have warmed by as much as 7 degrees.
The Northeast and Upper Midwest are the regions warming fastest, and are running a nearly 5-degree winter fever. This includes some ski towns like Burlington, Vermont, (7.7 degree increase) and Concord, New Hampshire (6.6 degree increase). Winter in notoriously cold Milwaukee is now 6.7 degrees warmer on average.
For many, a little extra winter warmth may sound nice. But milder winters come with consequences.
“Wintertime plays important roles in the life cycles of plants, animals, and insects, the recharging of freshwater supplies, and sustaining snow and ice for winter recreation, which supports local economies,” said Lauren Casey, a meteorologist at Climate Central.
A warmer winter doesn’t mean it’s sweltering like summer all season long — there will still be cold days in a warmer climate. But the cold of winter will become less frequent and less extreme. As average temperatures rise, it will leave less room for extreme cold swings.
Cold snaps across the US are now an average of six days shorter than they were in 1970, Climate Central’s data shows. And though cold temperatures will still occasionally set records, they are far more likely to be outpaced by warm records.
There are double the warm temperature records as cold ones in 2023. At night, the discrepancy grows, and there is triple the number of record warm low temperatures compared to record cold ones, NOAA data shows.
Overnight minimum temperatures are warming faster in winter than in any other season since records began in 1896. Winter’s overnight temperatures have been warming at a rate of 1.78 degrees per century since 1900 — 25% faster than the rate for winter’s daytime highs, according to CNN analysis of NOAA data.
A separate Climate Central analysis of overnight low temperatures at 231 US locations found 88%, or 204 cities, experienced a long-term decrease in the average number of freezing nights each year since 1970.
Reno, Nevada, now has 91 fewer freezing nights each year on average, losing more than any other location the list. Cities in Nevada, Arizona, California and Florida that used to see an occasional night below freezing no longer feel the chill at all.
Even cities known for cold outbreaks — like Buffalo, New York, Chicago, New York City, Boston, and Detroit — now no longer experience two-to-three weeks’ worth of freezing nights each year.
These changes are bad news for several industries that rely on a predictable chill.
Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests
A study by the International Olympic Committee found rising temperatures may cause ski season to “start up to a month later and finish up to three months earlier,” a finding that threatens to take $1 billion out of the US economy, according to a 2018 study by the climate advocacy group POW and REI.
On US farms, the $27 billion fruit and nut industry is losing out on chilling time as winters warm — a necessary exposure for the crops to chilly temperatures which allows them to properly bloom in the spring, another Climate Central analysis found.
For example, viable chill time in California’s fertile Central Valley, where 40% of the US’ fruits and nuts are grown, could drop by 25% by the end of the 21st century, the US Department of Agriculture said.
With less chill time, there could be less produce like walnuts, pistachios, and cherries to go around, and what’s left is more likely to be of poorer quality, the USDA said.
“That, of course, could lead to impacts for food companies, as well as increased food prices which can contribute to or worsen food insecurity,” Casey told CNN.
The warmer, longer growing season also increases exposure to pests and pollen, worsening allergies.
Worse yet, for winter lovers: The season of sniffles and sneezes will also be here sooner than you might expect — warming winters are causing spring to start weeks ahead of schedule."
Scientists successfully replicate historic nuclear fusion breakthrough three times,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/20/climate/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough-replicate-climate/index.html,"Scientists successfully replicate historic nuclear fusion breakthrough three times
Follow:
Scientists in California shooting nearly 200 lasers at a cylinder holding a fuel capsule the size of a peppercorn have taken another step in the quest for fusion energy, which, if mastered, could provide the world with a near-limitless source of clean power.
Last year on a December morning, scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California (LLNL) managed, in a world first, to produce a nuclear fusion reaction that released more energy than it used, in a process called “ignition.”
Now they say they have successfully replicated ignition at least three times this year, according to a December report from the LLNL. This marks another significant step in what could one day be an important solution to the global climate crisis, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels.
For decades, scientists have attempted to harness fusion energy, essentially recreating the power of the sun on Earth.
After making their historic net energy gain last year, the next important step was to prove the process could be replicated.
Brian Appelbe, a research fellow from the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the ability to replicate demonstrates the “robustness” of the process, showing it can be achieved even when conditions such as the laser or fuel pellet are varied.
Each experiment also offers an opportunity to study the physics of ignition in detail, Appelbe told CNN. “This provides valuable information to the scientists in addressing the next challenge to be overcome: how to maximize the energy that can be obtained.”
Unlike nuclear fission — the process used in the world’s nuclear plants today, which is generated by the division of atoms —﻿ nuclear fusion leaves no legacy of long-lived radioactive waste. As the climate crisis accelerates, and the urgency of ditching planet-heating fossil fuels increases, the prospect of an abundant source of safe, clean energy is tantalizing.
Nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun and other stars, involves smashing two or more atoms together to form a denser one, in a process that releases huge amounts of energy.
US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough, source says
There are different ways of creating energy from fusion, but at NIF, scientists fire an array of nearly 200 lasers at a pellet of hydrogen fuel inside a diamond capsule the size of a peppercorn, itself inside a gold cylinder. The lasers heat up the cylinder’s outside, creating a series of very fast explosions, generating large amounts of energy collected as heat.
The energy produced in December 2022 was small — it took around 2 megajoules to power the reaction, which released a total of 3.15 megajoules, enough to boil around 10 kettles of water. But it was sufficient to make it a successful ignition and to prove that laser fusion could create energy.
Since then, the scientists have done it several more times. On July 30, the NIF laser delivered a little over 2 megajoules to the target, which resulted in 3.88 megajoules of energy — their highest yield achieved to date, according to the report. Two subsequent experiments in October also delivered net gains.
“These results demonstrated NIF’s ability to consistently produce fusion energy at multi-megajoule levels,” the report said.
There is still a very long way to go, however, until nuclear fusion reaches the scale needed to power electric grids and heating systems. The focus now is on building on the progress made and figuring out how to dramatically scale up fusion projects and significantly bring down costs.
At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, US climate envoy John Kerry launched an international engagement plan involving more than 30 countries with the aim of boosting nuclear fusion to help tackle the climate crisis.
“There is potential in fusion to revolutionize our world, and to change all of the options that are in front of us, and provide the world with abundant and clean energy without the harmful emissions of traditional energy sources,” Kerry told the climate gathering.
In December, the US Department of Energy announced a $42 million investment in a program bringing together multiple institutions, including LLNL, to establish “hubs” focused on advancing fusion.
“Harnessing fusion energy is one of the greatest scientific and technological challenges of the 21st Century,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement. “We now have the confidence that it’s not only possible, but probable, that fusion energy can be a reality.”

As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.
It’s doubt and confusion.
That’s why the news from COP28 in Dubai is so infuriating.
The COP — an international peer-pressure meeting meant to avert disastrous global warming — is supposed to be a moment of resounding clarity, when world leaders come together to re-up their commitments to abandon fossil fuels and promote a future that’s, you know, livable.
The message should be clear: The world can and should abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible in favor of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.
We have the technology and the political levers we need to succeed.
Instead, the COP28 talks have been mired in controversy and confusion.
The United Arab Emirates, a petrostate, is hosting the talks. The COP president is Sultan Al Jaber, the head of a renewable energy company and also the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.
Appointing an oil exec to run global climate negotiations is not unlike letting the NRA facilitate a symposium on gun control.

No surprise, then, that Al Jaber made some, well, stupefying comments, including that abandoning fossil fuels — which, again, should be the point of these talks — risks putting us “back into caves.” He also claimed, falsely, that there is “no science” supporting a total phase-out of fossil fuels in order to meet temperature goals that are the center of the negotiations.
“Please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves,” he said on November 21, in the days leading up to the COP28 summit. The remarks were part of a conversation with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special climate envoy, and were first reported by The Guardian, which posted a video of the discussion.
“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” he said, referencing a temperature target from the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
A report issued Sunday during COP28 by Future Earth, The Earth League and The World Climate Research Programme, states that “a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required” to meet global climate goals.
Al Jaber tried to walk back the comments at a press conference on Monday, saying that he respects science and that the comments were subject to “misrepresentation.” “I have said over and over that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuels is inevitable,” he said.
By then, however, the damage had been done.
Observers are right to question Al Jaber’s intentions and the intent of this entire process. And the public could understandably be confused about whether these efforts are even worthwhile.
That’s tragic, especially in light of the long and frustrating history of fossil fuel interests injecting doubt into policy conversations about the climate crisis. The broad strokes of climate science have been well understood for several decades now.
Starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science.

But starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. The fallout of that doubt still haunts political conversations about the climate crisis today. It leads to years and decades of stalled or flimsy action.
It’s also frustrating given that the public has few opportunities to focus on global warming — and the annual COP meeting tends to be one such moment when the world pays attention.
In the United States, only 35% of adults talk about the climate crisis at least occasionally, according to a 2021 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Slightly less — 33% — hear about it at least once a week in the media.
Not quite what you’d expect given that the habitability of our planet is in jeopardy. We are living with the consequences of a world we’ve warmed today — in the form of wildfires, extreme weather, searing drought and a burgeoning extinction crisis in the natural world.
If there’s a silver lining to the fact that Al Jaber’s comments have been wildly distracting, and disruptive, it’s that there is some benefit to plainly observing the predicament we are in.
Heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels continues to go up year after year.
There are plenty of people and companies who profit from it.
Perhaps calling for Al Jaber to resign is part of a short-term solution to restore the credibility of COP28 and all the COP meetings still to come. But there’s a bigger point on which there must be absolute clarity in the public mind: We must demand a total phase-out of fossil fuels.
World leaders at COP28 can and should deliver on that promise.
And the public must hold them to account.

Where’s the snow? Feet of snow is missing in major Northeast cities and recent storms are no help,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/16/weather/snow-new-york-northeast-climate/index.html,"Where’s the snow? Feet of snow is missing in major Northeast cities and recent storms are no help
Follow:
A storm headed for the Northeast is expected to be another rainy, blustery mess – leaving parts of the snow-starved region pining for any significant snow.
Several major Northeast cities are enduring record-long waits for significant snowfall that has left them missing feet of snow over the last two winters.
Six cities from Richmond, Virginia, to New York City have waited nearly 700 days to see an inch of snow fall in a day. Historically snowier cities, like Boston, have waited nearly as long to see 3 inches.
Recent storms have been no help. This weekend’s storm will be the second consecutive one to track through these cities only to leave snow lovers there out to dry.
Even if in the long run record-long snowless streaks are emblematic of what winter is more likely to look like in a warming world, this year’s El Niño winter could at least be the temporary antidote for the snow drought currently plaguing the Northeast megalopolis.
A snow drought nearly two years in the making
Warmer temperatures and imperfect storm tracks are behind the lack of snow in the Northeast.
Storms can produce snow, but their exact track is crucial – a shift east or west could be the difference between snow or rain. Snow also can’t reach the ground unless there is plenty of cold air, even with an ideal storm track.
Many storms last winter tracked north and west of the New York City metro, leaving the area stuck on storms’ warmer side where precipitation fell as rain instead, James Tomasia, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in New York City told CNN.
Despite some recent flurries, Saturday marks the 671st consecutive day without an inch of snow in New York City, its longest such wait on record.
Truly cold and prolonged air was also hard to come by last winter for much of the season across the Northeast. It was one of the warmest winters on record in both Philadelphia and in New York City. New York also had its warmest January on record.
It’s also been simply too warm for significant snow closer to the Northeast coast so far in December, and only the interior and high elevations in the region have seen decent snow as a result.
New York’s unprecedented streak was in jeopardy twice earlier this year. For two consecutive days in late February, 0.9 inches of snow fell in Central Park. But those two days were paltry and made up the majority of the snow in what was New York’s least-snowy winter on record.
The lack of snow is adding up. New York City records almost 30 inches of snow in a typical winter, but has now missed out on around three feet of its normal snowfall the past two winters – despite recording nearly 18 inches in the winter of 2021-2022.
Like New York, it’s been a record long wait for an inch of snow in Philadelphia, Baltimore and the Washington, DC, area at Washington’s Dulles International Airport. Washington’s Regan National Airport is enduring its fourth-longest stretch of days without an inch of snow.
Some snow did accumulate in the Washington, DC, area on Monday, but totals amounted to under an inch at both airports.
All of these cities are missing multiple feet of their typical snowfall since the winter of 2021-2022.
Even cities that are less snowy on average are suffering from a lack of snow. Richmond, Virginia, became a prime example after only receiving a mere trace last winter compared to its typical nearly nine inches.
But like all streaks, these are made to be broken.
The snow drought is “unlikely to continue through the whole season” since, historically, recording this little snow is “rare,” Alex Staarmann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey, told CNN.
El Niño could be the key ingredient to break the snow drought
Snowfall amounts across portions of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic may get a boost from El Niño this winter.
The mid-Atlantic, especially, is one part of the country that could hit the snowfall jackpot this winter because of El Niño. El Niño - a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – affects the position of the jet stream and the overall track of storms across the US.
New maps reveal who could see more snow this winter during a strong El Niño
“El Niño generally favors a snowier pattern for the area, and thus, it’s more probable to see decent snow,” Staarmann explained.
Storms that affect the mid-Atlantic’s snow chances during an El Niño winter typically take a track along the spine of the Appalachians or push off the coast and become nor’easters.
These nor’easters can get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture during El Niño and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average, Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, previously told CNN.
This could bring above-average snowfall to places like Washington, D.C., Baltimore and even Philadelphia, where less than an inch fell last winter."
A potent storm is headed for Florida and the East Coast this weekend,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/weather/weekend-weather-forecast-rain-climate/index.html,"A potent storm is headed for Florida and the East Coast this weekend
Follow:
A potent storm will track from the Gulf of Mexico into Florida and move north up the East Coast this weekend, bringing with it the chance of flooding rainfall and gusty winds for much of the eastern United States.
The storm’s exact track and strength as it moves through Florida and into the Southeast Saturday are still unclear and will determine the storm’s severity in spots all the way to New England into next week.
Two scenarios are possible; one that pulls the storm toward the Florida Panhandle and then more inland, and one that brings it into the Florida Peninsula and then closer to the coast.
For now, the threat of flooding rain and gusty winds is most pronounced in Florida, parts of the Gulf Coast and the Southeast on Saturday. Additional threats may also develop, including severe thunderstorms and coastal hazards like flooding and rip currents.
In preparation for the severe weather, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis activated the state guard Friday, his office said in a news release.
DeSantis also directed the state’s division of emergency management to prepare equipment needed to help residents who may experience flooding, strong wind gusts and tornadoes, the release said.
The forecast should become clearer by Friday, but for now, here’s what each scenario could unleash this weekend.
Scenario 1: Florida Peninsula, then more coastal
Heavy rain will begin Saturday and continue through Saturday night across much of Florida in both scenarios. But in scenario one, the track of the storm brings most of the flooding rain straight to the state’s peninsula, reducing the risk in the panhandle.
A slight risk, or Level 2 of 4, of excessive rainfall is forecast for the Florida Peninsula on Saturday, while a marginal risk, or Level 1 of 4, is forecast for the Florida Panhandle, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
Rain could fall heavily enough on Saturday to trigger flash flooding, especially across South Florida where it’ll continue to be quite soggy through the week’s end.
The heavy rain will also be accompanied by gusty winds, with the strongest winds arriving Saturday evening as the center of the storm closes in on the Florida coast. Widespread wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are possible across much of the Florida Peninsula through Saturday night in this scenario, with stronger gusts possible at the coast.
Strong wind gusts will also push water ashore and produce coastal flooding, especially along Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dangerous surf and rip currents are also likely through the weekend across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys and the southeast Atlantic coast.
As if drenching rainfall, strong winds and coastal flooding weren’t enough, a few severe thunderstorms may rumble to life late Saturday across the Florida Peninsula. These storms may produce tornadoes, but it’s not a guarantee given the complexity of the forecast.
On Sunday, the storm tracks northeast and moves out of Florida to hug the Southeast coast, which could mean the heaviest rain and strongest wind sets up closer to the coast.
The storm will spread rain across more of the Southeast by late Saturday and rain will become drenching by Sunday. Enough rain could fall to cause flash flooding in Georgia and the Carolinas.
The storm could continue to move along the coast into the Northeast, which typically means gusty, stormy weather for the region.
Scenario 2: Florida Panhandle, then more inland
This scenario is slightly less likely than the first scenario, but some computer forecast models say it’s still a possibility.
In it, the Gulf storm makes a beeline for the Florida Panhandle on Saturday, unloading the worst of its rain there. This track also places more of southern Georgia and southern Alabama in the heaviest rain threat.
This scenario’s track, which is more western, moves the location of Saturday’s strongest winds into more of the Florida Panhandle. Breezy conditions are still likely across the peninsula in this scenario, but gusts may not be as strong or as frequent.
Deadly tornadoes leave thousands displaced or without power in Tennessee
Coastal impacts could expand along more of Florida’s Gulf Coast if this scenario were to play out.
A storm closer to the Panhandle could drive winds directly into the coast from South Florida into the state’s Big Bend region and lead to expansive coastal flooding. Rough seas and dangerous rip currents are also likely in this scenario.
The storm may then track northward along the spine of the Appalachians Saturday night through Sunday and spread heavy rain much farther inland than the first scenario. Rain is still likely across much of the Carolinas, but it may be less intense.
Monday will be a sloppy day with plenty of rain across much of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast as the storm tracks north, regardless of its final track."

Follow:
Money talks, but nature may have the last word if climate change continues to unfold at current rates.
The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently calculated that transitioning to a sustainable, carbon-neutral future would take $13.5 trillion in investment globally between now and 2050. It’s a monumental figure, yet if industries like production, energy and transport can’t be transformed, the true cost for humanity could be much higher.
Tracking developments in this transition is all part of the job for WEF President Børge Brende. CNN spoke with him last weekend at the Doha Forum, an annual gathering of high-level diplomats and policymakers in the Qatari capital, for a temperature check on the century’s biggest challenge.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
CNN: What are some of the challenges that come with transitioning to a green economy and do the benefits outweigh those challenges?
Børge Brende: There is no doubt that the cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of action when it comes to climate change. So we do have to act, but there’s also a big energy transition taking place and there are several challenges at the same time.
There’s energy poverty – 800 million people don’t have access to electricity – there’s energy security, and then there’s a decoupling of growth in energy and CO2 emissions.
Is the Middle East headed in the right direction? What does this mean for the future?
Decarbonization has started in the Middle East. Some of the biggest solar plants in the world are being installed and established here in the Middle East, and especially in the GCC countries (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait).
Renewables will play a very important role in the energy transition that we will hopefully see in the coming decade. Also the price of renewables is falling dramatically ­– solar power has fallen to one-tenth of the price in a decade, so that makes it also very competitive.
Should events like this be considered an opportunity for sustainable development and economic growth?
This event also focuses on the energy transition, and Qatar is a major exporter of liquid natural gas. We know that gas emits half (the carbon emissions) coal does. So in the energy transition, natural gas can also in many countries be a bridge between heavily emitting fossil fuels to a renewables-based society."

Conflict resolution is a skill sorely needed in the world right now. As president and CEO of global think-tank International Crisis Group (ICG), Comfort Ero has plenty of experience in the field.
Ero has spearheaded the conflict resolution non-profit since 2021, after stints working at the United Nations, and before that, at the ICG’s West Africa project. Born in England to Nigerian parents, she has lived and worked on the African continent, and been heavily involved in peacekeeping operations in Liberia.
One of the areas monitored by the ICG is the impact of the climate crisis as a destabilizing factor for Africa – especially for the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa – and the organization has pushed for leaders to consider mitigation strategies.
Last weekend, halfway through the COP28 climate summit, CNN spoke to Ero at Doha Forum, an annual meeting of policy leaders in the Qatari capital, about the action she hopes to see from today’s leaders.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
CNN: Have the effects of climate change been an obstacle when it comes to conflict resolution in Africa?
Ero: I wouldn’t say it’s an obstacle. It’s one of the key issues that we have to grapple with. Countries that are already affected by conflict and violence also have to deal with issues around drought and flooding. Whether it’s in the Horn of Africa writ large or the Sahel, one of the challenges that we face is how to manage competition over resourcing; how to deal with displacement caused by climatic shocks like drought and flood; and to deal with that in the context of violence and conflict and instability.
What should world leaders be doing more of in that case?
We have to take (climate change) seriously. It is existential; it’s transnational. We’ve got to think not just about loss and damage, but we’ve got to think about how to support countries to deal with adaptation and resilience. Money is required not just to deal with loss and damage – and it’s great that that was put on the agenda – but we’ve got to think now about the capabilities and capacities for countries that are dealing with multiple challenges going forward.
What are you hoping to see as a result of this year’s Doha Forum?
To see more investment in diplomacy. To give diplomacy a chance rather than assuming that you can resolve a conflict through military confrontation. That there’s more listening, more understanding, and there’s more empathy on both sides in conflicts. As far as we can see at the International Crisis Group, the biggest challenge today is a crisis in peace-making – and right now I think we need to focus on giving peace a chance."

Why Big Oil isn’t losing any sleep over the new climate deal
Is this the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era? The world’s latest climate deal could be that milestone. But recent events show the oil and gas industry still has a very different vision of the future.
Following marathon talks, the COP28 climate summit in Dubai struck a deal Wednesday that makes the unprecedented call for “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”
Some countries, including the United States, welcomed the firmest-ever commitment to moving away from energy sources responsible for most planet-heating emissions, but critics were quick to point out that the agreement falls far short of requiring the world to “phase-out” oil, coal and gas, a position more than 100 nations had supported.
“The resolution is marred by loopholes that offer the fossil fuel industry numerous escape routes,” said Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International.
However vague or watered down the language, the deal looks out of touch with reality.
US oil production is at a record; India plans to double coal output by 2030; the UK is issuing new drilling licences in the North Sea; and American oil majors are splurging billions on deals that signal they see robust demand for decades to come.
“Anything less than a systematic transformation of the fossil fuel industry would be at odds with COP28’s deal,” said Daniel Klier, the CEO of ESG Book, a provider of sustainability data on companies. “The reality is no single climate summit can single-handedly drive the transition away from fossil fuels, let alone a phase out.”
Takeaways from COP28: What does the climate deal say?
The latest evidence of the industry doubling down on fossil fuels came Monday, when Occidental Petroleum said it would pay $12 billion in cash and stock to buy US shale oil producer CrownRock.
It followed ExxonMobil’s (XOM) October announcement of a $60 billion deal to acquire shale driller Pioneer Natural Resources, and Chevron’s (CVX) agreement less than two weeks later to buy shale producer Hess for $53 billion. Hess (HES) also has large oil assets in Guyana, which Chevron said would help grow its production over the next decade.
Another $50-billion oil and gas deal could take shape soon, this time in Australia. Woodside Energy and Santos are talking about a merger that would create one of the world’s biggest exporters of liquified natural gas (LNG) in a clear bet on continued strong demand from Asia for the fuel.
“Markets aren’t functioning properly and are rewarding the wrong companies … If anything, our future depends on markets rewarding those oil companies that are decarbonising at pace,” said ESG Book’s Klier.
But cash-rich oil giants are taking advantage of recent windfall profits to snap up lower-cost assets and boost shareholder returns, while directing much less investment to renewable energy.
The industry invested just $20 billion in clean energy projects last year — only around 2.5% of its total capital spending, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
The Paris-based agency says that share would need to shoot up to 50% by 2030 to help keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — a limit scientists say is crucial to avoid a significant worsening in the effects of climate change, including extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages.
Pledges from climate talks not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, IEA says
The recent flurry of deals offers little hope that oil and gas firms are planning radical changes to how they spend their cash, even though that is what is urgently needed.
“With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement last month ahead of the climate summit. “The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai.”
On Wednesday, Birol struck a more sanguine note. “I congratulate the #COP28 Presidency & countries for this major outcome that clearly states the goal of transitioning away from fossil fuels in line with 1.5C,” he posted to X.
The IEA did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, beyond Birol’s remark, on how the deal stacks up with what is unfolding on the ground, which is clearly at odds with its previous calls for a stop to all new investment in oil and gas projects. The agency said Sunday that the world is still off-track to limit global warming to the crucial 1.5-degree threshold, despite pollution-slashing pledges made by dozens of countries at COP28. It thinks global demand for oil, gas and coal is likely to peak by 2030.
Even Europe’s oil giants, including Shell (SHEL) and BP (BP), which have a better track record on renewable energy investment than their US rivals, are still channeling billions towards fossil fuels. Earlier this year, BP backed away from climate targets it set three years ago, curbing ambitious cuts to carbon emissions and oil and gas production.
Oil and gas companies operating in Norway, western Europe’s largest producer, are planning to invest 240 billion Norwegian crowns ($21.85 billion) in 2024 — 9% up on this year and nearly a quarter more than previously expected, Reuters reported — citing a survey from industry group Offshore Norway.
Elsewhere, the United Kingdom committed earlier this year to granting “hundreds” of new licenses to enable companies to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea.
Much bigger oil and gas producing nations also look to be heading in the wrong direction. In a joint statement Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GEPC) — groups that include the United Arab Emirates, host of COP28 — welcomed the “consensual and positive” outcome reached in Dubai but stressed that “continued investment in oil and natural gas is essential.”
A recent United Nations Environment Programme report found that the world’s fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than twice the amount needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.
One of the major contributors to that disastrous overshoot will be India, which is burning ever greater amounts of coal and oil as it tries to meet the needs of its 1.4 billion people. It plans to double domestic coal production by 2030, even as it also sets ambitious targets for renewable energy.
In perhaps the clearest sign yet that the world’s latest climate deal will do little to reshape the future for fossil fuel producers, Saudi Arabia — the world’s biggest oil exporter and OPEC kingpin — welcomed it.
Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya that the COP28 deal would not affect the Kingdom’s hydrocarbon exports.
“The text, it provides alternatives,” he said.

Follow:
The world agreed to a new climate deal in Dubai on Wednesday at the COP28 summit after two weeks of painstaking talks, making an unprecedented call to transition away from fossil fuels, but using vague language that could allow some countries to take minimal action.
The gavel went down on the agreement, known as the Global Stocktake, in the morning after the talks were pushed into overtime by marathon negotiations between countries bitterly divided over the future role for oil, gas and coal.
COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber called the agreement “historic” in his speech before national delegates at the final session approving the agreement. “We have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement for the first time ever,” he said, adding that the deal represented “a paradigm shift that has the potential to redefine our economies.”
Some countries claimed the deal signaled the end of the fossil fuel era, but more ambitious nations and climate advocates said it was still far from sufficient to reflect the growing urgency of the climate crisis.
What the deal asks countries to do
“At long last the loud calls to end fossil fuels have landed on paper in black and white at this COP,” said Jean Su, the energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, “but cavernous loopholes threaten to undermine this breakthrough moment.”
Transition away from fossil fuels? Big Oil has other ideas
The agreement falls short of requiring the world to “phase-out” oil, coal and gas — which more than 100 countries and many climate groups had been calling for, language which was included in an earlier version of the draft.
Instead, the agreement “calls on” countries to “contribute” to global efforts to reduce carbon pollution in ways they see fit, offering several options, one of which is “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems … accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050.”
Key takeaways: What does the COP28 deal say?
COP28 has taken place at the end of a year defined by unprecedented global heat, which has driven deadly extreme weather, including record wildfires, deadly heat waves and catastrophic floods. This year is officially the hottest on record, due to a combination of human-caused global warming and El Niño, and next year is set to be hotter still.
The conference in Dubai has been marred by controversy and criticism that oil interests were influencing the talks.
The conference also saw deep divisions, with Saudi Arabia leading a group of oil-producing nations rejecting language on phasing out fossil fuels. On the other side, more ambitious parties, including the European Union and a group of island states, expressed anger over a previous draft with watered-down language on fossil fuels.
US climate envoy John Kerry said divisions nearly derailed the conference, as oil- and gas-producing nations pushed back on fossil fuel language.
“I think there were times in the last 48 hours where some of us thought this could fail,” Kerry told reporters Wednesday. But ultimately they “stepped up and said, ‘we want this to succeed.’”
Kerry called the deal a success and a vindication of multilateralism.
“All of us can find a paragraph or sentences, or sections, where we would have said it differently,” he said in an earlier speech after the deal was agreed. But, he added, “to have as strong a document as has been put together, I find is cause for optimism, cause for gratitude and cause for some significant congratulations to everybody here.”
He said that the agreement was “much stronger and clearer as a call on 1.5 than we have ever heard,” referring to the internally-agreed ambition to restrict global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a threshold beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt.
“The message coming out of this COP is we are moving away from fossil fuels,” Kerry said. “We’re not turning back.”
Deal gives fossil fuel industry ‘escape routes’
Several parties expressed disappointment and concerns over how quickly Al Jaber struck his gavel and adopted the draft deal. Typically countries voice their support or objections and agreement follows a debate.
“It seems that you gavelled the decisions and the small island developing states were not in the room,” Anne Rasmussen, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said to Al Jaber once they entered the room.
AOSIS, an intergovernmental organization of countries disproportionately at risk from the climate crisis, is one of the most powerful voices at the annual climate talks.
AOSIS was “exceptionally concerned” about the agreement, Rasmussen added. While the text contains “many good elements,” she said, “the course correction that is needed has not yet been secured” and “we see a litany of loopholes.”
“It is not enough for us to reference the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do,” she said in her speech which was met with a standing ovation from delegates.
Many climate experts, while cautiously welcoming the reference to fossil fuels in the agreement, point to serious weaknesses, including leaving the door open for fossil fuel expansion to continue.
Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International, said “after decades of evasion, COP28 finally cast a glaring spotlight on the real culprits of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. A long-overdue direction to move away from coal, oil, and gas has been set.”
But, he added, “the resolution is marred by loopholes that offer the fossil fuel industry numerous escape routes, relying on unproven, unsafe technologies.”
His reference is to the controversial technology known as carbon capture and storage — a set of techniques being developed to pull carbon pollution from polluting facilities such as power plants and from the air, and store it underground. The agreement calls for an acceleration of the technology.
Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is unproven at scale, a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use and too expensive.
Some countries and experts were alarmed by the agreement’s recognition of a role for “transitional fuels” in the energy transition — largely interpreted to mean natural gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel.
“We want to raise the alarm that transition fuel will become permanent especially in developing countries,” said an Antigua and Barbuda delegate.
There was also criticism over a failure to ensure enough funding will flow to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable countries to help them adapt to the escalating impacts of the climate crisis and move their economies toward renewable energy.
COP28 started with an early success on finance. On the first day, countries formally adopted a loss and damage fund decades in the making, and have since made pledges of more than $700 million to help nations on the front lines of climate change.
But the summit agreement — while acknowledging developing countries need up to $387 billion a year to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis and around $4.3 trillion is required each year up to 2030 to scale up renewable energy — includes no requirements for developed countries to give more.
Developing countries “still dependent on fossil fuels for energy, income, and jobs, are left without robust guarantees for adequate financial support,” Singh said.
Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, said in a statement the “transition” in this agreement “is not funded or fair.”
“We’re still missing enough finance to help developing countries decarbonise and there needs to be greater expectation on rich fossil fuel producers to phase out first,” Adow said."

Here’s why the final agreement is dividing opinion.
What’s in the climate deal?
The agreement marks the first time the annual UN meeting has asked countries to move away from fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis.
The text of the agreement “calls on” countries to “contribute” to global efforts to reduce carbon pollution. It lists a menu of actions they can take, including “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems … accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050.”
World agrees to climate deal that makes unprecedented call to move away from fossil fuels, but ‘cavernous’ loopholes remain
What the agreement doesn’t do is require a “phase-out” of fossil fuels. That ambitious language was supported by more than 100 countries, including the United States and European Union, but was fiercely opposed by fossil fuel states such as Saudi Arabia.
The agreement also calls for a tripling of renewable energy capacity and a doubling of energy efficiency, both by 2030.
Countries are also being asked to have detailed adaptation plans in place by 2025, to show how they intend to deal with the current and future impacts of the escalating climate crisis.
The agreement also acknowledges the need for trillions of dollars of funding to flow from rich countries to poorer, climate vulnerable ones, to help them adapt climate change and transition to renewable energy. But there are no requirements in the deal for wealthy countries to give more.
What are the loopholes?
The agreement contains a “litany of loopholes” which could “take us backward rather than forward,” Anne Rasmussen, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a speech Wednesday.
What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it’s a dangerous distraction
Those loopholes refer to the option for countries to accelerate zero- and low-carbon technologies, including carbon capture and storage – a set of techniques that are still being developed with the aim of removing carbon pollution from the atmosphere.
Many scientists and other experts have said that carbon capture is unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use, potentially giving license to polluters to carry on burning fossil fuels.
The International Energy Agency sees a limited role for carbon capture in energy-hungry sectors such as steelmaking, which can’t yet be effectively powered by renewables like wind and solar.
Another “loophole” that has angered some countries and climate experts is the agreement’s recognition of a continued role for “transitional fuels” — largely interpreted to mean methane gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel.
What are people saying about the agreement?
Several climate negotiators and international groups called the final text historic and significant, while also being careful to say it does not go far enough or fast enough to rein in the climate crisis.
“The message coming out of this COP is we are moving away from fossil fuels,” US climate envoy John Kerry told reporters at a Wednesday press conference. While he acknowledged the final agreement represented a compromise, he called it a success and a vindication of multilateralism.
Transition away from fossil fuels? Big Oil has other ideas
“We’re not turning back,” he added.
Other observers noted the text gives leeway to fossil fuel producers.
Tom Evans, a policy advisor at E3G, told CNN “there are some good elements in here but the signal on fossil fuels is muddled – it recognizes that we are turning away from fossil fuels at long last but still too slowly.”
The draft “sends a signal that the fossil industry’s days are numbered,” Teresa Anderson, global climate lead at ActionAid, said in a statement. But, she added, it still contains “offers several gifts to the greenwashers, with mentions of carbon capture and storage, so-called transition fuels, nuclear power and carbon markets.”
What else came out of COP28?
The first day of COP28 opened with a surprise agreement to adopt a climate damage fund that was the result of decades of hard-fought negotiations.
Many countries, including COP28 host country the UAE, have since made pledges totaling more than $700 million to help nations hit hardest by the climate crisis deal with its consequences.
US announces rule to slash powerful planet-warming methane by nearly 80% from oil and gas
More announcements on climate finance were made during the rest of the summit; the UAE  pledged to create a $30 billion climate finance fund and put $250 million into it by the end of the decade.
During Vice President Kamala Harris’s visit to COP, the US pledged $3 billion towards the Green Climate Fund, the main finance vehicle to help developing nations adapt to the climate crisis and cut fossil fuel pollution.
Slashing emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas, was also a sharp focus in the early days of the meeting. The US announced regulations to cut methane pollution from the nation’s huge oil and gas industry by nearly 80% through 2038.
And 50 major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco, signed a pledge to cut their methane emissions by the end of the decade, each committing to reduce their methane intensity by around 80% to 90% by 2030.
What comes next?
Now the deal is agreed, countries are required to update their national plans in 2025 to reduce emissions, detailing how much they’ll cut down on planet-warming pollution by 2035.
The US and China, the world’s two biggest emitters, have already jointly committed that their plans will cover all economy-wide climate pollution, and reduce emissions from non-CO2 gases such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons. That agreement marked a major commitment from China, in particular, which emits more carbon dioxide than the rest of the developed world combined.
Speaking Wednesday, Kerry said the two countries were actively encouraging the rest of the world’s nations to follow. But Kerry warned that more ambition was needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.
“That’s our challenge. Speed it up; bring it to scale – bigger, faster,” Kerry said.
Attention will now move to next year’s summit. After a fraught selection process, Azerbaijan, another major oil and gas producing nation, was tapped to host the 2024 talks."
"New climate summit draft calls for transition away from fossil fuels, but still has ‘loopholes’",https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/12/climate/cop28-climate-summit-agreement-tuesday/index.html,"New climate summit draft calls for transition away from fossil fuels, but still has ‘loopholes’
Follow:
A new draft of the centerpiece agreement at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai makes an unprecedented mention of transitioning away from fossil fuels, in what some experts are welcoming as the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.
But it does not call for the world to “phase out” coal, oil and gas — as more than 100 countries had hoped — and includes “loopholes” that would allow for their continued use, even beyond 2050.
The draft, which could continue to be debated, calls on countries to “contribute” collectively to global efforts to reduce climate pollution in a way that they see fit. It offers eight options, one of which is “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems … accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050.”
Countries could choose other options instead, including contributing to a global goal of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency.
Climate advocates and policy experts welcomed the call to transition away from fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis — saying it sends a signal to countries to make plans to wean off coal, oil and gas and recognizes this decade as critical for action.
The draft “sends a signal that the fossil industry’s days are numbered,” Teresa Anderson, global climate lead at ActionAid, said in a statement.
‘Verge of complete failure’: Climate summit draft drops the mention of fossil fuel phase-out, angering advocates
But Anderson pointed out several weaknesses in the draft, including references to accelerating growth in “removal technologies,” also known as carbon capture, which would allow for the continued use of fossil fuels if their carbon pollution was removed before entering the atmosphere. Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use.
“The text has many loopholes and offers several gifts to the greenwashers, with mentions of carbon capture and storage, so-called transition fuels, nuclear power and carbon markets,” she said. “Overall, it maps a rocky road towards a fossil free future.”
The draft was published Wednesday morning local time, more than 12 hours after the summit’s deadline, as talks ran hours into overtime as countries negotiated language around fossil fuels and other sticking points. There will be widespread appetite to wrap up talks by the end of the day, which will require a vote on the draft in a plenary session that will be publicly available online.
What to do about the future of fossil fuels has been the most contentious issue at these talks. Some more ambitious nations and climate advocate had expressed anger and frustration an earlier draft dropped the call for a phase-out.
If the text is agreed by countries, it would represent a “significant moment,” Stephen Cornelius, WWF deputy global climate and energy lead, said in a statement.
“[But] this cannot be the benchmark by which we judge the outcome of this COP,” he said. “Countries must use these final hours to push for an even more ambitious text that is fully aligned with preventing the most devastating consequences of the climate crisis.”
The annual climate talks are often divisive and run into extra hours, but COP28 has been particularly fraught, with criticism that oil interests have derailed the process.
The fossil fuel industry was given record access to the conference, a recent analysis showed. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who is presiding over the talks, also leads the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company as it undergoes a major expansion in oil and gas production. He has consistently rejected criticisms of a conflict of interest and pledged to hold a transparent process.
The secretary-general of the oil-producing group OPEC, Haitham Al Ghais, called on members and allies last week to “proactively reject” any language that targeted reducing fossil fuel use, telling members to support language that focuses on “emissions” instead.
Saudi Arabia and Iraq were among the countries that did not want reference to a phase-out of fossil fuels in the text, Catherine Abreu, the founder and executive director of the nonprofit group Destination Zero, told reporters in Dubai. Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA said the country’s delegation to COP28 was “reaffirming” its rejection of a phase-out as well.
The COP28 presidency has fended off criticism that the text had been too watered down. On Tuesday, it said it supported a “historic” deal that included some language on fossil fuels and aimed for “the highest ambition.”
“We are facing the most demanding COP agenda of all time,” said COP28 Director-General Ambassador Majid Al Suwaidi in a news conference.
This is a developing story and it has been updated."
Scientists uncover a surprising phenomenon in the Himalayas that might be slowing the effects of climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/12/world/himalayan-glaciers-cooling-air-climate-scn/index.html,"Scientists uncover a surprising phenomenon in the Himalayas that might be slowing the effects of climate change

Glaciers in the Himalayas are melting rapidly, but a new report showed an astonishing phenomenon in the world’s tallest mountain range could be helping to slow the effects of the global climate crisis.
When warming temperatures hit certain high-altitude ice masses, it sets off a surprising reaction that blows robust cold winds down the slopes, according to the study published December 4 in the journal Nature Geoscience.
The warming climate creates a greater temperature gap between the surrounding air above Himalayan glaciers and the cooler air directly in contact with the ice masses’ surface, explained Francesca Pellicciotti, professor of glaciology at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of the study.
“This leads to an increase in turbulent heat exchange at the glacier’s surface and stronger cooling of the surface air mass,” she said in a news release.
As the cool, dry surface air gets cooler and denser, it sinks. The air mass flows down the slopes into the valleys, causing a cooling effect in the glaciers’ lower areas and neighboring ecosystems.
With ice and snow from the mountain range feeding into 12 rivers that provide fresh water to nearly 2 billion people in 16 countries, it’s important to find out whether the Himalayan glaciers can keep up this self-preserving cooling effect as the region faces a likely rise in temperatures over the next few decades.
A June report previously covered by CNN showed that glaciers in the Himalayas melted 65% faster in the 2010s compared with the previous decade, which suggests rising temperatures are already having an impact in the area.
“The main impact of rising temperature on glaciers is an increase of ice losses, due to melt increase,” said Fanny Brun, a research scientist at the Institut des Géosciences de l’Environnement in Grenoble, France. She was not involved in the study.
“The primary mechanisms are the lengthening and intensification of the melt season. They cause glaciers to thin and retreat, leading to deglaciated landscapes that tend to further increase the air temperature due (to) larger energy absorption by the surface,” Brun said.
That energy absorption at the surface is determined by something called the albedo effect. Light or “white” surfaces such as clean snow and ice will reflect more sunlight (high albedo) compared with “dark” surfaces such as the land that is exposed as glaciers retreat, soil and oceans (low albedo). In general, Brun said this phenomenon is interpreted as a positive feedback loop, or a process that enhances a change, but it is overall poorly studied and difficult to quantify.
At the base of Mount Everest, however, measurements of overall temperature averages appeared curiously stable instead of increasing. A close analysis of the data revealed what was really happening.
“While the minimum temperatures have been steadily on the rise, the surface temperature maxima in summer were consistently dropping,” said Franco Salerno, coauthor of the report and researcher for the National Research Council of Italy, or CNR.
However, even the presence of these cooling winds is not enough to fully counteract increasing temperatures and glacier melt due to climate change. Thomas Shaw, who is part of the ISTA research group with Pellicciotti, said the reason these glaciers are nevertheless melting rapidly is complex.
“The cooling is local, but perhaps still not sufficient to overcome the larger impact of climatic warming and fully preserve the glaciers,” Shaw said.
Switzerland’s glaciers lose ‘mind-blowing’ volume of ice in just two years
Pellicciotti explained that the general scarcity of data in high-elevation areas across the globe is what led to the study team’s focus of using the unique ground observation records at one station in the Himalayas.
“The process we highlighted in the paper is potentially of global relevance and may occur on any glacier worldwide where conditions are met,” she said.
The new study provides a compelling motivation to collect more high-elevation, long-term data that are strongly needed to prove the new findings and their broader impacts, Pellicciotti said.
Located at a glacierized elevation of 5,050 meters (16,568 feet), the Pyramid International Laboratory/Observatory climate station sits along the southern slopes of Mount Everest. The observatory has recorded detailed meteorological data for almost 30 years.
It’s those granular meteorological observations that Pellicciotti, Salerno and a team of researchers used to conclude that warming temperatures are triggering what are called katabatic winds.
The cold winds, created by air flowing downhill, usually occur in mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.
“Katabatic winds are a common feature of Himalayan glaciers and their valleys, and have likely always occurred,” Pellicciotti said. “What we observe however is a significant increase in intensity and duration of katabatic winds, and this is due to the fact that the surrounding air temperatures have increased in a warming world.”
Another thing the team observed was higher ground-level ozone concentrations in connection with lower temperatures. This evidence demonstrates that katabatic winds work as a pump that’s able to transport cold air from the higher elevation and the atmospheric layers down to the valley, Pellicciotti explained.
“According to the current state of knowledge, Himalayan glaciers are doing slightly better than average glaciers in terms of mass losses,” Brun said.
Brun explained that in Central Himalaya, on average, the glaciers have thinned about 9 meters (29.5 feet) over the past two decades.
“This is much lower than glaciers in Europe, which have thinned of about 20 meters (65.6 feet) over the same time span, but this is larger than other regions in Asia (for example in the Karakoram region), or in the Arctic region,” Brun said.
Understanding how long these glaciers are capable of locally counteracting global warming’s impacts could be crucial in order to effectively address our changing world.
Rapid melting in West Antarctica is ‘unavoidable,’ with potentially disastrous consequences for sea level rise, study finds
“We believe that the katabatic winds are the response of healthy glaciers to rising global temperatures and that this phenomenon could help preserve the permafrost and surrounding vegetation,” said study coauthor Nicolas Guyennon, a researcher at the National Research Council of Italy.
Further analysis is needed, however. The study team next aims to identify the glacial characteristics that favor the cooling effect. Pellicciotti said more long-term ground stations for testing this hypothesis elsewhere are virtually absent.
“Even if the glaciers can’t preserve themselves forever, they might still preserve the environment around them for some time,” she said. “Thus, we call for more multidisciplinary research approaches to converge efforts toward explaining the effects of global warming.”
A separate report in 2019 found that even in the most optimistic case, in which average global warming was limited to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures, the Himalaya region would lose at least one-third of its glaciers."
Training a new generation of ‘climate doctors’,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/health/climate-change-health-care-doctors/index.html,"Training a new generation of ‘climate doctors’
Follow:
For Dr. Aaron Hultgren, the wake-up call was Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when the young emergency physician returned from an overseas trip and found his hospital without power, its doors closed to the public.
Dr. Lakshmi Balasubramanian, an oncologist in Austin, Texas, signed up to study climate medicine after the death of a patient who was trapped in her home during a freak winter storm two years ago.
Dr. Paul Charlton, a physician with the Indian Health Service in northwest New Mexico, was motivated by 2023’s summer heat wave, when temperatures cracked 100 degrees Fahrenheit for nearly a week straight in July, setting all-time records.
Hultgren, Charlton and Balasubramanian traded these stories in early November as they gathered in College Station, Texas, midway through a first-of-its-kind diploma program that will mint them as certified experts in “climate medicine.” The course is the brainchild of Dr. Jay Lemery, director of the Climate and Health Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
India’s urban population is exploding. That could have huge consequences for the planet
“This is our first foray into training a climate-savvy health care workforce,” Lemery said. “We need credible, knowledgeable and effective leaders, and we want to send a message to clinicians that these are critically important skills for mitigating climate-driven health effects.”
This past weekend, at the UN climate conference in Dubai, 123 countries signed an acknowledgment that climate change is having a major impact on human health, along with announcements of nearly half a billion dollars in funding commitments to bolster health systems and reduce overall harms to human health.
Lemery, who was at the meeting, says, “We just saw huge pledges and initiatives to double down on resiliency and decarbonisation, and yet no one has been trained to do this.”
Awareness of climate’s harms has been building, especially since 2009, when the journal The Lancet called climate change the “biggest global health threat of the 21st century.” Warming temperatures extend the range of disease-carrying pests like mosquitoes. Heat and drought disrupt crop cycles, leading to food shortages. Between 2030 and 2050, according to a World Health Organization report in October, climate change will cause an extra 250,000 deaths per year just from malnutrition, malaria, diarrheal disease and heat stress.
Warnings like this are a growing part of US medical education. Since 2019, the number of US medical schools requiring coursework on the effects of climate change has more than doubled. Universities and public health graduate programs offer majors and concentrations, but the Colorado diploma program goes a step further and aims to turn working medical professionals into leading experts on climate and health.
“It’s specifically designed for working clinicians who are seeking a ‘heavyweight’ credential,” said Lemery, an emergency physician by training. “We wanted to build a program that has real gravitas.”
Lemery’s program offers five separate certificate programs, each of which satisfies requirements for continuing medical education credits.
To earn a diploma, students complete all five, over a period of more than two years. The most recent module was designed to help participants prepare for and simulate a response to a major weather disaster.
With striking images, this photographer is illuminating our relationship with the planet
Following readings and class discussions — over Zoom, since participants live in all corners of the country — course directors Dr. Terry O’Connor and Dr. Bhargavi Chekuri booked two days at a unique training facility. “Disaster City” is sprawled across 52 acres near the Texas A&M campus, where visitors will find upside-down train cars, smashed cars and buses and pile after pile of concrete rubble. Physicians are not the usual clientele; firefighters, EMTs and disasters come for the facility’s world-renowned search-and-rescue training.
The November training didn’t include any rubble piles, but the climate medicine students ran through tabletop simulations posing challenges like: What does your hazard vulnerability assessment need to include? How do you convince hospital administrators to pay for expensive, disaster-proofing upgrades that may never be used? If your hospital’s backup generator runs out, do you evacuate all the patients?
Lemery says the simulations cut straight to the essence of medical training. “Practice makes perfect. We can’t possibly be good at something unless we flex those muscles, go through the paces and learn how to make it better. When disasters hit, we want our medical teams and hospitals to say, ‘Don’t worry, we got this.’ We don’t want them pacing around wondering where we keep the emergency action plan.”
The federal government and states have strict requirements for hospitals to avoid catastrophic power failures, but as the simulation exercise made clear, that may not be enough. Generators flood. Evacuation routes may be blocked.
Dr. Karen Glatfelter, a physician from Lawrence, Massachusetts, told the group that supply chain issues are common.
“After Hurricane Maria, hospitals across the country ran into IV saline shortages that took months to work through,” she said.
Arien Hermann, who oversees a regional hospital coordinating center in southern Illinois, noted that not all electrical outlets are connected to a generator. At one hospital in Hermann’s network, this included the entire kitchen.
“So if you lost power, you weren’t going to have a microwave; you weren’t going to have refrigeration; you weren’t going to have electric stoves; you weren’t even going to have lights.”
Feeding patients and staff, the group agreed, would be a problem.
Controversy hangs over climate talks as countries weigh whether to ditch fossil fuels
Hurricane Sandy underscored the vulnerability of many major hospitals. The storm killed at least 147 people and caused $82 billion in damage, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Even Sandy faded into a mere tropical storm, a massive storm surge flooded 51 square miles of New York City, put much of Lower Manhattan underwater, led six hospitals to close and forced the evacuation of 6,500 patients. Hultgren, like many others, was utterly unprepared. “I never in a million years imagined that we would even lose power. It was a complete shock.”
Since Sandy, the number of weather disasters causing $1 billion or more in damage has soared; this year alone has seen 23 such events. But a changing climate is only one reason. A major factor is the higher cost of rebuilding, due to inflation, coupled with increased housing density in flood-, fire- and storm-prone areas. As a 2022 report from NOAA points out, “Much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains.”
But recent years have also seen an apparent rise in storms like Hurricane Harvey, which dropped nearly 60 inches of rain on Houston while barely moving for five days, and Hurricane Idalia, which shocked forecasters in September by growing into a Category 4 storm nearly overnight. Such storms put an additional premium on planning and flexibility.
Unpredictable hurricanes aren’t the only threat from climate change, but they are part of what many people describe as climate “weirding,” new weather patterns that upend patterns of sickness and health.
Charlton, the Indian Health Service physician, whose home base of Gallup, New Mexico, sits at 6,500 feet of elevation, says he never imagined he would see the kind of extended heat that baked the town this summer. “Until now, we haven’t had to have cooling centers.”
Dr. Hilary Ong, a pediatric emergency physician from San Francisco, says doctors are taught to expect a cold and flu season that lasts from October to February. “Now, what I see in the pediatric emergency room is that respiratory season is lasting from September up to August. There was no break.”
Ong regularly cares for young patients who are dehydrated from extreme heat or struggling with asthma flare-ups after being exposed to wildfire smoke. She wonders, “Why am I seeing kids with asthma exacerbations all year ‘round?”
Being “climate-informed” helps clinicians do their daily jobs better, Chekuri says. She offers the example of a patient who comes in with a nagging cough. “A climate-informed physician might be aware of the fact that our pollen seasons are longer, sometimes more intense” and unpredictable. “If you’re not thinking about that change in the environment, then you can’t ask whether someone has had allergies before.”
Most doctors don’t think about climate on a day-to-day basis.“The realization about climate impacts on everyday patients was slow to come to me,” said Dr. Joanne Leovy, a physician from Las Vegas who is pursuing the climate medicine diploma. “People come into the office all the time with climate-related disease that we don’t recognize. And until you learn about the connections, you’re not going to see it.”
Many of the first doctors to focus on climate were emergency physicians or disaster relief workers. Those specialties are well represented in the Colorado program, but the group at Disaster City also includes three oncologists, a psychiatrist, an infectious disease specialist, a pediatrician, a family practitioner, two nurses and Hermann, a paramedic, Marine Corps veteran and hospital system administrator. Several students are already deeply involved in efforts to reduce waste and reduce the carbon footprint of the hospitals where they work; they point out that the US health care system is responsible for nearly 9% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Glatfelter pushed her hospital to switch out the standard gases used for anesthesia - replacing desflurane, the use of which in hospitals produces greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a million cars - with a less-harmful alternative.
The past decade was the hottest on record as climate change ‘surged alarmingly,’ WMO reports
Dr. Elizabeth Cerceo, a hospitalist who chairs the “green team” at Cooper University Hospital in southern New Jersey, says there’s a laundry list of improvements that most hospitals can make, from re-examining their supply chains to simply replacing standard light bulbs with LEDs. Often, she says, it’s simply inertia that blocks change.
Dr. Katie Lichter, an oncology resident at the University of California, San Francisco, co-founded the GreenHealth Lab at UCSF, which generates research reports about the environmental impact of health care practice and “how climate change may reduce patient access to essential care.”
Lichter’s big moment of clarity came during the first days of her residency training at UCSF. Just a few months after she moved to San Francisco in 2020, Northern California was struck with a string of severe wildfires that sent a heavy blanket of smoke across the region. Locals still refer to “orange-sky day,” when the thick smoke generated its most surreal views.
Lichter had just admitted a patient into the ICU with Covid-19 as well as worsening cancer and lung disease. “He had missed weeks of crucial chemo and radiation because he couldn’t travel because of the wildfires,” she said. Pulling off her mask and gloves and home that night, she had an epiphany: “Climate change was going to impact my patients directly. This would be part of my career in medicine.”
Indeed, Lichter’s published research shows that cancer patients treated during times of wildfires have worse outcomes. Although cancer isn’t the first thing that springs to mind when it comes to climate change, Lichter says it shows how climate’s effects ripple through everything the health system touches.
“It’s the whole continuum of care,” she said. “Climate change increases exposure to carcinogens through air pollution and increased exposure to viral causes of cancer. And with screening, climate disasters impact access, like a patient’s ability to go get a mammography.”
The ability to access treatment, too.
Balasubramanian, the Austin-based oncologist, can’t say for sure that a winter storm killed her patient, but the woman had been fine a few days earlier. “She was thriving and doing very well,” the doctor recalls. “She was an avid volunteer and an advocate for pets and other women with breast cancer.”
The Colorado team encourages participants in the diploma program to be advocates on climate-related issues. Says Ong, “That’s really my motivation [for taking this course], to learn about this kind of medicine, to be a better physician and in order to lead and advocate and educate my peers and colleagues.”
Lemery points out that even after the height of the Covid pandemic, doctors and nurses typically rank high as trusted sources of information. “It’s important to bring the best science forward with candid-evidence based risk assessments. Our job is to train practitioners to be confident and proficient in doing just that.”
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
Mike Bethel, a nurse in Fresno, California, says he feels a duty “to speak out, as that trusted source, about things we know are true. We know that climate change is happening, and we know that it’s impacting our health negatively. When we don’t speak out about that as a profession, I think we do a disservice.”
Bethel says air pollution blocks views of the coastal mountain range that were visible almost every day when he was a Boy Scout roaming the mountains not far from where he lives today. He goes on to list other ominous signs. In Fresno, he says, “summers are longer. Summers are hotter. Our wildfire seasons have extended; they’re starting earlier and ending later. I mean, we’re already beyond a point of no return. There’s some damage that is irreparable, and if we continue, we’re going to damage the planet to the point where maybe it’s just not habitable.”
This dark view is shared by many here, but it’s tempered by a strong streak of idealism. Hultgren, who was an elementary school teacher before going to medical school, says he’s excited about forging a new path.
“As an emergency medicine physician, you always want to be at the front line, and I feel like I am at the front line, really trying to do something. We’re trying to change and hopefully impact our future for the better.”

Follow:
Climate advocates are warning the COP28 climate summit could be on the cusp of failure after a new draft of the core agreement removed a call to phase out fossil fuels, the main driver of the climate crisis.
The draft, posted Monday more than six hours later than expected, instead used watered-down language on fossil fuels in an apparent concession to oil-producing nations that opposed the measure.
It calls on countries to take actions to reduce planet-warming pollution, which “could” include reducing the consumption and production of oil, coal and gas. Many climate experts and observers have blasted the draft for its vague language – including the use of the nonspecific “could” – and a lack of concrete timelines.
More than 100 countries came to the Dubai talks supporting language to phase out fossil fuels, and many are likely to voice their opposition in coming sessions. Others, such as Saudi Arabia, which have pushed against the inclusion of any reference to fossil fuels, may attempt to water the text down further still.
If the current draft does not get widespread support, negotiators may need to return to debate.
As climate chaos accelerates, which countries are polluting the most?
Earlier drafts had included several options that called on countries to phase out climate-polluting oil, gas and coal, which observers said was an encouraging sign that this year’s summit agreement would be stronger than previous years.
Climate advocate and former US Vice President Al Gore said in a post on X the summit “is now on the verge of complete failure.”
“The world desperately needs to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible, but this obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word,” Gore said. “It is even worse than many had feared.”
The secretary-general of the oil-producing group OPEC, Haitham Al Ghais, called on members and allies last week to “proactively reject” any language that targeted fossil fuels rather than emissions.
The letter, written before the latest draft was posted, noted the previous option for a “fossil fuels phase out” and said it would be “unacceptable that politically motivated campaigns put our people’s prosperity and future at risk.”
Al Gore calls UAE hosting COP28 ‘ridiculous,’ slams oil CEO appointed to lead climate talks
The new draft calls for countries to take action to reduce planet-warming emissions, with a menu of choices that could include “reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050 in keeping with the science.” It also includes an option for “tripling renewable energy capacity globally.”
“We have made progress. But we still have a lot to do,” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber said Monday in a summit session. “You know what remains to be agreed. And you know that I want you to deliver the highest ambition on all items, including on fossil fuel language.”
Al Jaber, who is also the head of the UAE’s state-owned oil company, has had a controversial summit.
Shockwaves ripped through the talks shortly after they began last weekend when comments from Al Jaber made in November came to light. In a panel discussion, he said there is “no science” behind the demand that phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius — the goal of the Paris climate agreement.
In response, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate science the next day, and said phasing out fossil fuels is “inevitable” and “essential.”
‘Our death certificate’
Monday’s draft came after marathon negotiations and was published more than six hours later than expected. The conference is due to end on Tuesday, but the new draft — which is far from what many nations in Dubai had called for — could prolong one of the most contentious and high-stakes conferences in its nearly three decade history.
The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organization, has already indicated its members will not approve the agreement in its current form and has criticized the negotiations as lacking transparency and inclusivity.

“We will not sign our death certificate,” Cedric Schuster, a Samoan politician and chair of AOSIS, said in a statement. “We cannot sign on to text that does not have strong commitments on phasing out fossil fuels.”
A US State Department spokesperson said in a statement the draft “seeks to balance a variety of interests,” but still “needs to be substantially strengthened.”
Lead negotiators for the European Union described the draft as “insufficient.”
“I cannot hide the fact from you that the text, as it now stands, is disappointing,” EU Climate Action Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters. “There are a couple of good things in there, but overall, it is clearly insufficient and not adequate to addressing the problem we are here to address.”
Hoekstra added that the EU was sticking to its stance, calling for the for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, allowing only for fossil fuel use in sectors where renewables are difficult to employ. Heavy industries like steelmaking, for example, can’t use wind and solar power.
Alok Sharma, a British MP and the president of COP26 in Glasgow two years ago, said it’s “difficult to see how this text will help to achieve the deep and rapid cut in emissions we need by 2030.”
“With so many countries backing clear language on fossil-fuel-phase-out, who does this text actually serve?” Sharma said on X, formerly Twitter.

Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said the latest draft was “a significant regression” from previous versions.
“Astonishingly, it has dropped explicit language on phasing out fossil fuels, opting instead for a vague commitment to ‘reduce both consumption and production’ by 2050,” he told CNN. “This is a clear indication of the fossil fuel industry’s lobbying power, influencing global policies to favor prolonged fossil fuel use.”
Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and a lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the draft agreement was “extremely disappointing, concerning, and nowhere close to the level of ambition people around the world deserve.”
“This draft comes with a huge qualifier of ‘could’ at the top that makes all the listed actions optional for nations. It has a laundry list of actions filled with glaring loopholes, including a lack of meaningful timelines” she said in a statement.
Some experts were more optimistic. “We are cooking a fossil free meal here in Dubai,” said Mohamed Adow, director of climate think tank Power Shift Africa, in a statement. “People will argue if it’s the correct recipe, but the main thing is that all the right ingredients are there.”

Follow:
A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.
Severe tropical cyclone Jasper strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane Friday, with maximum winds of 220 kilometers per hour (138 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.“Further intensification Friday is possible, and a category 5 system cannot be ruled out,” the country’s meteorology bureau said.
Jasper is the earliest Category 4 tropical cyclone to form in the Coral Sea since records began in 1900, according to CNN research of National Hurricane Center storm tracks.
The storm, which is located 1,195 kilometers (742 miles) northeast of Queensland and moving south at 9 kph (6 mph), could strike the coast near Cairns, a city of 250,000 people, with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph) by early Tuesday.
However, forecasters say its projected path could change.
The storm’s arrival is unusually early during El Niño, a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and generally reduces rainfall along Australia’s east coast.
Controversy hangs over climate talks as countries weigh whether to ditch fossil fuels
The system has impacted weather all over the world this year and can particularly influence storm seasons.
Meanwhile, heat warnings are in effect in several states and territories, including New South Wales, home to more than 8 million people.
Temperatures in the NSW capital Sydney are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, with the heat fueled by strong, dry winds.
Some schools in Sydney were forced to shut Friday and a total fire ban was in place in some parts of NSW, due to the increased risk of bushfires.
A “catastrophic” fire rating was issued in parts of South Australia on Friday, the highest on the scale, which indicates that lives and properties are likely to be lost if a fire starts.
Extreme fire danger ratings were in place in parts of New South Wales and Victoria.
The heat is forecast to weaken somewhat by the end of the weekend into early next week.
Australia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis, with frequent heat waves, extreme rainfall and devastating bushfires.
Earlier this year, more than 20 runners in the Sydney Marathon were hospitalized in a heat wave during Australia’s warmest winter since records began in 1910.
Ski resorts, including Perisher, the country’s largest, also closed early due to a lack of snow.
Fears were particularly high as memories of the catastrophic 2020 Black Summer fires – the country’s worst in decades – remain etched in the minds of millions of Australians.
The fires burned 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres), killing dozens of people and destroying more than 3,000 homes."
"Pledges from climate talks not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, IEA says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/10/climate/cop28-iea-warning-doha-intl/index.html,"Pledges from climate talks not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, IEA says
Follow:
The world is still off track to limit global warming to the crucial 1.5-degree threshold, despite pollution-slashing pledges made by dozens of countries at UN-backed climate talks in Dubai, an analysis by the International Energy Agency published Sunday shows.
The assessment is the first comprehensive report card on what the COP28 climate talks in Dubai have so far achieved.
The results show that the commitments would slash greenhouse gas emissions by 4 gigatons — less than one-third of what is now required to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above temperatures before industrialization. Science shows that life on Earth will struggle to adapt beyond that point.
An IEA statement said the pledges “would not be nearly enough” to keep global heating to 1.5 degrees.
Executive Director Fatih Birol said the pledges were “positive” and in line with some of the recommendations the IEA had made ahead of the talks. But he said not enough countries had joined them and that commitments to ensuring a decline in fossil fuel use was needed to bridge the gap.
“The IEA’s very latest assessment of these pledges shows that if they are fully implemented by their signatories to date, they would bridge only 30% of the gap to reaching international climate goals,” Birol told CNN. “There is a need for more countries and companies to join the pledges — and for agreement on an orderly and just decline of global fossil fuel use if we want to keep the 1.5 °C goal in reach.”
Negotiators at COP28 are discussing an agreement in which they could call for the phase-out of fossil fuels — the main driver of climate change — for the first time at the annual climate talks.
Language on fossil fuels has been highly contentious, and there are deep divisions over the issue. More than 100 countries support a phase-out in some form, but some oil-producing nations don’t want any reference to reducing oil and gas at all.

The IEA analysis was based on pledges around renewable energy, energy efficiency and the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
More than 120 countries, including the United States, have now agreed to support tripling the world’s renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency measures.
Fifty major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco, also signed a pledge at the talks to cut methane emissions from their oil and gas operations by the end of the decade. That means a reduction in methane intensity of around 80 to 90% from their products. They also agreed to end routine flaring by 2030. Flaring is the deliberate burning of natural gas during oil extraction. Companies sometimes flare natural gas to depressurize systems during oil drilling, though at other times, flaring occurs when an operator doesn’t need or want to collect all the gas available, often because it’s cheaper to burn it than collect it.
Fossil fuel consumption is the main driver of the climate crisis. Countries agreed to a phase-down in coal production in 2021 at the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, but negotiations on language around all fossil fuels, including oil and gas, are proving more contentious.
The talks are happening at the tail-end of a year hit hard by the worsening climate crisis. Scientists have confirmed that 2023 is officially the hottest on record. Extreme weather events made more likely or intense by the climate crisis — including fires, floods, heatwaves and hurricanes — have claimed lives in many parts of the world.
The COP28 presidency responded to the IEA’s assessment, saying the progress it outlined showed “a major breakthrough,” adding “no previous COP has achieved so much so soon.”
COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber told reporters earlier that progress in the negotiations on a final agreement, however, were not moving fast enough.
“Am I satisfied with the speed and the pace? The answer is ‘No,’” he said on Sunday before convening a roundtable of ministers to try and break the impasse over several issues, including the future of fossil fuels.
“Time is ticking. The clock is ticking, and I’m sure you can all hear it, just like how I am able to hear it,” he said, “and we need to move much, much, much faster.”
Al Jaber has been the subject of controversy for months, well before the talks began on November 30. The United Arab Emirates has been accused of a conflict of interest in appointing Al Jaber to chair the talks as he also runs the country’s state-owned oil and gas company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company."
CNN poll: Large majority of US adults and half of Republicans agree with Biden’s goal to slash climate pollution,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/politics/cnn-poll-climate-change/index.html,"CNN poll: Large majority of US adults and half of Republicans agree with Biden’s goal to slash climate pollution
Follow:
Nearly two-thirds of US adults say they are worried about the threat of climate change in their communities, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. More than half are worried about the impact of extreme weather, as the climate crisis touches every region in the form of extreme heat, devastating storms and drought.
Even more want the federal government to do something about it. A broad majority of US adults – 73% – say the federal government should develop its climate policies with the goal of cutting the country’s planet-warming pollution in half by the end of the decade.
That has been the goal of President Joe Biden, who has made tackling the climate crisis a greater priority than any other president, including through billions of dollars in tax subsidies to create more renewable energy infrastructure and help consumers buy discounted electric vehicles, solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. The Biden administration is also crafting and implementing several federal regulations designed to cut pollution from the oil and gas industry, power plants, and gas-powered vehicles.
The polling comes as nations debate the future of fossil fuels at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Vice President Kamala Harris announced at the summit last week that the US would commit another $3 billion to the global climate action fund, and the Biden administration announced new rules to slash emissions of methane – a powerful planet-warming gas – by 80% from the US oil and gas industry.
Cutting US climate pollution is a bipartisan aspiration, the CNN poll finds. Nearly all Democrats say the US should slash its greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030, and 76% of independents and half of Republicans agree.
American voters could be presented with a stark choice on how their country addresses climate change in the 2024 election; a potential rematch between Biden – who signed the country’s biggest climate investment into law last year – and former President Donald Trump, a climate change denier who has vowed to repeal several of Biden’s signature clean-energy policies.
When it comes to climate change, Americans say by a 13-point margin that their views align with Democrats more than Republicans. Much like abortion, climate change is one of the strongest issues for Democrats, CNN’s poll finds.
As climate chaos accelerates, which countries are polluting the most?
Americans give Biden a 43% approval rating for his handling of environmental policy, which is several points above his overall approval rating and well above his numbers for handling the economy. But few Americans, only 2%, see climate change as the most important issue facing the country, giving higher priority to the economy and cost of living.
But climate change and clean energy are increasingly intertwined with the economy. Climate change-fueled disasters don’t just impact commerce, they also strike at the heart of the American dream: homeownership.
In some states prone to wildfires and extreme weather, the cost of home and property insurance is skyrocketing. In some cases, insurance companies are dropping coverage all together because the risk is too high. That, in turn, has damaging implications for the housing market and cost of homes, experts have told CNN.
Most US adults say humanity bears a great deal of responsibility to try to reduce climate change but believe the US and Chinese governments and the energy industry are all doing too little to fix the problem.
Americans are also finding less fault with themselves: A somewhat lower 40% of Americans say that people like them hold a great deal of responsibility to reduce climate change. Meanwhile, 58% say that they, personally, are doing the right amount to reduce their impact on the climate crisis, with 37% saying that they are doing too little.
As past polls have found, there is a profound partisan divide over how Americans feel about climate change, and what to do about it, that outweighs other factors such as age and gender. The poll finds Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that humanity bears a great deal of responsibility to reduce climate change (77% vs. 42%). And Democrats are 36 percentage points likelier than Republicans to say they’re very worried about the risk of climate change in the communities where they live.
But the fact that human activity is fueling the planet’s warming isn’t lost on Republicans; the poll finds about three-quarters of them think humanity has at least some responsibility to fight climate change.
The poll finds that more than 4 in 10 Americans say they’ve experienced extreme weather over the past year, with most in that group calling climate change a contributing factor. In the past few years, Americans have faced climate-fueled extreme heat, drought and flash flooding that has devastated communities.
The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 1-30 among a random national sample of 1,795 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups."

Follow:
A wide-reaching storm is set to affect much of the eastern half of the US this weekend with heavy rain, severe thunderstorms, strong winds and even snow.
The weekend storm will begin to take shape on Friday as an area of low pressure develops in the southern Plains. Energy left over from a deadly atmospheric river in the Northwest earlier this week will arrive in the central US and boost the strength of the developing storm.
Any impactful weather from the storm will hold off until late Friday when it gets better organized and tracks out of the southern Plains and into the Midwest.
From there, the storm’s impact will grow substantially, with heavy rain, thunderstorms and gusty winds reaching the entire East throughout the weekend.
Saturday: Severe storms fire up
As the storm strengthens and expands its reach on Saturday, adverse weather will stretch more than 1,200 miles from the Gulf Coast to the Canadian border.
Thunderstorms will rumble to life Friday night with a small window in which isolated severe thunderstorms could develop in parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas, ahead of Saturday’s threat to the south.
The main thunderstorm event will kick off across portions of the South by Saturday morning as a cold front associated with the storm cuts east across the region. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe and deliver damaging wind gusts and hail. A slight risk, or Level 2 of 5, for severe thunderstorms is forecast for portions of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, especially by Saturday afternoon.
As chances for damaging thunderstorms increase Saturday afternoon, the storm will also spread rain across a wide portion of the country from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Rain will begin in the earliest hours of Saturday across portions of the Midwest and Mississippi Valley and spread east throughout the day.
Rain will become steady as the day progresses and could become heavy at times, especially across the South. Fortunately, the storm is likely to move along at a brisk pace that will keep rainfall totals from skyrocketing, but any drenching rainfall could cause flooding issues.
Gusty winds will also accompany any rainfall, even outside of thunderstorms.
A thin stripe of accumulating snow is possible on Saturday from Wisconsin to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, but this will be mostly a rain event for much of the Midwest.
Sunday: Strong wind event takes shape
The storm will reach its maximum strength by the afternoon as it expands and engulfs much of the East. Wind gusts from the storm will be quite a bit stronger on Sunday compared to Saturday and could knock out power and disrupt travel.
Widespread gusts of 40 to 50 mph will buffet the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Gusts will crank even higher and reach up to 60 mph at times Sunday night in New England and coastal portions of New York and New Jersey.
Winds this strong, especially when coupled with drenching rain, could bring down a few trees and cause power outages. Strong winds and rain may also disrupt air travel across the busy corridor and lead to slowdowns for drivers.
Any unsecured outdoor holiday decorations may be blown away by the strongest winds.
Rain will be the primary precipitation type from Florida to New England, with widespread amounts of 1 to 2 inches likely. Higher totals are possible for areas drenched by multiple rounds of downpours.
Some thunderstorms will be embedded within the rainy area, even in the North. A few thunderstorms may become severe on Sunday, with an area from Georgia to Virginia the most likely to endure a handful of damaging storms.
Rain may change to wet snow across higher elevations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York on Sunday night as cold air pushes into the East on the backside of the storm.
Portions of New England could change over to a wintry mix of rain, snow and freezing rain late Sunday night and continue for a time on Monday.
Exact changeover times and snow amounts will depend on how quickly cold air can rush into the region.
Monday: Cold envelops the East
The storm will start to push off the East Coast on Monday, but rain and snow will continue across much of New England and parts of upstate New York through the afternoon before tapering off in the evening. Rainy, windy weather will come to an end in New York City by Monday afternoon while gusty winds slowly subside elsewhere in the Northeast, except for in New England.
It’ll be much chillier on Monday across the eastern half of the country in the wake of the storm. The difference in temperature between Monday and the weekend’s above average December temperatures will be most stark from the Southeast to Northeast."

India’s urban population is exploding. That could have huge consequences for the planet
Follow:
Over half a century ago, India’s then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi talked about the staggering challenge for developing nations: to industrialize without harming the environment.
“On the one hand the rich look askance at our continuing poverty — on the other, they warn us against their own methods,” she told a United Nations event in Stockholm in 1972, the first global conference to make the environment a major issue.
“We do not wish to impoverish the environment any further and yet we cannot for a moment forget the grim poverty of large numbers of people,” she added.
Her words have never been more relevant. The tension between economic growth and environmental protection is at the heart of global discussions about how to tackle the ever accelerating climate crisis.
Addressing the opening session of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai on Friday, India’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, said all developing countries must be given “a fair share in the global carbon budget” — the amount of planet-warming carbon pollution the world can emit and still avoid climate catastrophe.
Even though Earth is now heating up to dangerous levels, many governments around the world persist with viewing coal, oil and gas as sources of economic development, energy security and geopolitical power, the UN said this year.
As a result, the world’s fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than twice the amount needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the Paris climate agreement, a recent UN Environment Programme report found.
One of the major contributors to that disastrous overshoot will be India, which is burning ever greater amounts of coal and oil as it tries to meet the needs of its 1.4 billion people. It plans to double domestic coal production by 2030.
But even as the world’s most populous nation clings to coal with one hand, there are some signs that it is attempting to chart a more sustainable course with the other.
India has made “significant investments and set ambitious targets for renewable energy,” the UNEP report said, noting that the world’s fastest growing major economy has earmarked over $4 billion toward energy transition in this year’s national budget.
Other global agencies have also noted India’s growing ambitions in the pursuit of green energy. The Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report in October that the country was “moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition.”
In 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies.
Transforming India’s energy sector, like most things in the country, is going to be chaotic and muddled, but it will have far-reaching implications for the global energy market and the race to limit global warming.
“India’s net zero by 2070 target, if met in full and on time along with all respective national targets, will take the world to 1.7 degree Celsius global average surface temperature rise by 2100,” said Siddharth Singh, energy investment analyst at the IEA.
Getting there need not come at the cost of growth. Already there are “early signs of a gradually loosening link between economic development and carbon emissions,” said Singh.
If the country is able to meet its pledges, its carbon emissions will fall by over 40% by 2050, even as its GDP quadruples over this period, IEA said in its report.
Modern India is yet to be built
India is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, IEA data shows.
That could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of demand still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the South Asian nation will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said.
That superlative isn’t surprising as the country is expected to achieve some impressive economic milestones. The world’s fifth largest economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become only the third country with annual GDP of $10 trillion by 2035.
And as it develops and modernizes, its urban population is going to shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings.
“India adds the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years,” said Singh.
The Modi government is also trying to boost domestic manufacturing and that has unleashed a building boom, with everything from roads and bridges to ports and railways springing up around the country.
This infrastructure bonanza will lead to a surge in demand for coal and steel, which are huge sources of carbon emissions.
Electricity demand is also expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved standards of living to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years.
By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said this year.
Coal accounts for almost 70% of the country’s electricity generation and is not likely to change in the near future.
The future role of fossil fuels is one of the most controversial issues nations are grappling with at COP28. While some are pushing for a “phase-out,” others are calling for the weaker language of a “phase-down.”
India has said that the former option is not feasible at the moment. “We cannot phase out fossil fuels unless we have nuclear or until [energy] storage becomes viable,” India’s power minister R.K. Singh said last week, just days after he had said that the country won’t be rushed into reducing its use of coal.
“We are not going to do this … we are not going to compromise on availability of power for our growth, even if it requires that we add coal-based capacity,” the minister said in November.
Giant green goals
Still, the fact that India is developing at this point in history gives it a unique opportunity not to repeat the climate sins of wealthier nations.
The country was a reluctant signatory to the Paris climate accord in 2015, when more than 190 countries pledged to limit the precipitous rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a preferred goal of 1.5 degrees.
Those pledges haven’t yet been delivered. The world is careening toward nearly 3 degrees of global warming, even if current climate policies are met, the United Nations has warned.
The Modi government has set ambitious goals.
It has promised that renewable energy will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade. The government also set a target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by that period — up from about 173 GW last year.
India has launched an incentive program to boost domestic manufacturing in critical sectors including solar modules and advanced chemistry cell batteries. If the program works, it could see India establish itself as a “reliable exporter” of solar modules, the IEA said in its 2023 report.
“The country already has the world’s fourth largest combined capacity for wind and solar PV electricity generation, and will be the third largest by next year,” Singh said. “In the context of its development journey, India’s clean energy targets are indeed impressive.”
If Asia’s third largest economy is able to meet its pledges, it would also offer a new roadmap to growth, one that allows developing countries to get rich and go green at the same time.
Green billionaires
Major conglomerates are keen to seize the green opportunity.
India’s richest men, including Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, are investing billions into clean energy, even though they made their empire on the backs of fossil fuels.
“There has probably never been a better time than now for India to grow more sustainably,” said Tim Buckley director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance.
That’s because of two main reasons: the world is seeing unprecedented levels of investment in clean technologies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and solar energy is getting significantly cheaper, he explained.
But there is still a big funding gap. The IEA has said that energy investments need to nearly triple by the end of this decade for India to be on a trajectory to meet its zero emission targets. The Modi government wants rich nations to do more when it comes to climate financing.
The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to help both with their green transitions and efforts to adapt to the climate crisis. That pledge was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, but the target has never been met.
In his speech to COP on Friday, Modi warned that “thinking only about one’s self interest will only lead the world into darkness.”
Hopefully, that message will be heard by India’s vast bureaucracy as well.
“We just need more departmental action and urgency filtering down with respect to the excellent renewables ambition of Modi,” said Buckley. “India needs to make sure there’s an alignment of the implementation so that those really ambitious targets are going to be met”

These small words could make or break the global climate summit,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/climate/fossil-fuel-phase-out-cop28/index.html,"These small words could make or break the global climate summit
Follow:
The thorniest issue at the global climate summit in Dubai is clear: Fossil fuels. More precisely, the role they should play in our rapidly warming future.
As negotiators thrash out the terms of core agreements that will emerge from COP28, the big question is whether countries will ultimately agree to a phase-out of oil, gas and coal, a phase-down — or neither.
The difference between phase-out and phase-down sounds like semantics, but the ability of the world to hold back catastrophic climate change may hinge on it.
While concrete definitions are hard to pin down, a phase-out generally means the world will at some point stop burning oil, gas and coal altogether and bring levels of planet-heating pollution down to zero.
A phase-down, however, leaves the door open for countries to continue burning fossil fuels.
As climate chaos accelerates, which countries are polluting the most?
It “can mean anything where the future level (of fossil fuel burning) is lower than today’s,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London. The word “implies a level of ambition that is less clear, and also less ambitious, than a phase-out,” he told CNN.
Tensions around the terms were heightened this week in the wake of newly surfaced comments made by COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, in which he claimed there was “no science” saying a phase-out of fossil fuels is necessary to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
He told reporters Monday that his comments were misinterpreted, and a fossil fuel phase-out was “inevitable” and “essential,” but the comments sent shockwaves through the summit.
More than 100 countries have pushed for the phase-out language, and dozens of scientists signed an open letter Wednesday stating that “the link between climate science and fossil fuel phase out is unequivocal.”
So, if the agreement lands on phase down, will that make it even harder to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius?
“In isolation, yes,” Rogelj said, “but words and context matter and it’s not black or white.” A text that agreed on a phase-down of all fossil fuels by 2050, for example, with specific targets for the decline of coal, oil and gas could be very positive, he said.
The devil will be in the detail, and even if the more ambitious phase down terminology is agreed, there’s another important word to account for: “unabated.”
The EU and the US, for example, have both called for a phase-out of “unabated fossil fuels.” This would mean an end to burning oil, gas or coal without capturing the planet-heating pollution before it escapes into the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming.
2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, scientists report
The “abatement” refers to carbon capture and removal — a set of techniques that are being developed to remove carbon pollution from the air and to capture what’s being produced from power plants and other polluting facilities, then storing it or reusing it. Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use.
The world has taken so long to cut emissions that scientific bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say a limited amount of carbon capture will be needed. It is likely to be required for certain sectors, such as agriculture and aviation, for which “zero emissions does not seem possible in the coming decades,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter in the UK.
The question is, how much would be used and how effective would it need to be: If a fossil fuel plant captured 51% of its emissions, for example, would that be considered abatement?
The word “is meaningless without clear quality standards,” said Lisa Fischer, a program lead at climate think tank E3G.
The summit’s final agreement is expected around December 12, and experts are pushing for language to be precise, given the stakes.
Clarity is essential, Fischer said. “Ambiguity now doesn’t help anyone but the fossil fuel industry.”"
"2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, scientists report",https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/climate/2023-hottest-year-climate/index.html,"2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, scientists report
Earth’s temperature was off the charts this year, and scientists just confirmed what much of planet already felt coming: 2023 will officially be the hottest year on record.
The analysis from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found this year’s global temperature will be more than 1.4 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels — close to the 1.5-degree threshold in the Paris climate agreement, and beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt.
Every month since June has been the hottest such month on record, and November piled on. The month was roughly 1.75 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels, and two days soared beyond 2 degrees, worrying scientists about what this means for the planet in the coming years.
The report comes as delegates from more than 150 countries are in Dubai for COP28, the UN’s annual climate summit, where the discussion over whether to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels has been heated.
“The timing could not be more urgent,” Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who is not involved with the report, told CNN.
“Wealthy and high-emitting countries, which have contributed the most to this record-breaking year,” she added, “have a greater responsibility to make a fair, fast and funded phase out of fossil fuels to help limit the increasing extreme weather and climate change impacts.”
Scientists have said 2023’s exceptional warmth is the result of the combined effects of El Niño and human-caused climate change. A series of deadly heat waves and remarkable record-breaking temperatures have hit several continents this year, while unprecedented ocean heat blanketed much of the globe.
Fall in the Northern Hemisphere this year was the warmest on record around the world “by a large margin,” according to Copernicus. November was also wetter than average across most of Europe, with Storm Ciarán bringing heavy rain and floods to many regions including Italy.
As temperatures crank higher into the next year, the world appears to be on track to breach 1.5 degrees of warming on a longer-term basis in the coming years. While it’s worrisome global warming is exceeding that temperature for months at a time, scientists are particularly concerned the planet will stay above 1.5 degrees for the long term.
Through 2022, Earth had warmed around 1.2 degrees — and the past few years have made it abundantly clear that the world are already feeling alarming effects of the climate crisis that many are not prepared for.
A separate report released Tuesday from the World Meteorological Organization found the decade between 2011 and 2020 was the hottest on record for the planet’s land and oceans as the rate of climate change “surged alarmingly” and “turbo charged” dramatic glacier loss and sea-level rise during this period.
“As long as greenhouse gas concentrations keep rising, we can’t expect different outcomes from those seen this year,” Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said. “The temperature will keep rising and so will the impacts of heatwaves and droughts.”"

Follow:
Sultan Al Jaber, the oil executive who is leading the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, sent shockwaves through the gathering by claiming in the days before the UN-backed talks that there is “no science” that says phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to keep global warming under a critical threshold — comments Al Jaber said were misinterpreted.
Al Jaber held a surprise news conference Monday where he fiercely defended his commitment to climate science, after an increasing number of scientists and advocates expressed alarm at the comments and concern for the direction of the talks.
The future role of fossil fuels is one of the most controversial issues countries are grappling with at the COP28 climate summit. While some are pushing for a “phase-out,” others are calling for the weaker language of a “phase-down.” Scientific reports have shown that fossil fuels must be rapidly slashed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius﻿ — the goal of the Paris climate agreement, and a threshold above which scientists warn it will be more difficult for humans and ecosystems to adapt.
Al Jaber made the remarks during the She Changes Climate panel event on November 21, which came to light on Sunday in a story published by the Guardian, and in video that CNN has reviewed. Al Jaber was asked by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and current chair of the Elders Group, an independent group of global leaders, if he would lead on phasing out fossil fuels.
Interactive: As climate chaos accelerates, which countries are polluting the most?
In his response, Al Jaber told Robinson, “there is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5.” He said he had expected to come to the She Changes Climate meeting to have a “sober and mature conversation” and was not “signing up to any discussion that is alarmist.”
He continued that the 1.5-degree goal was his “north star,” and a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuel was “inevitable” but “we need to be real, serious and pragmatic about it.”
In an increasingly fractious series of responses to Robinson pushing him on the point, Al Jaber asked her “please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.”
Al Jaber’s presidency of the COP28 summit has been controversial. The Emirati businessman is the UAE’s climate envoy and chairs the board of directors of its renewables company, but he also heads the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).
A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects
Al Jaber told reporters Monday, “I have always been very clear on the fact that we are making sure that everything we do is centered around the science.”
“I honestly think there is some confusion out there, and misrepresentation and misinterpretation,” he said, adding, “I have said over and over that the phase down and the phase out of fossil fuel is inevitable. In fact, it is essential … it needs to be orderly, fair, just and responsible.”
A spokesperson for the COP28 team told CNN in a statement on Sunday “this story is just another attempt to undermine the Presidency’s agenda, which has been clear and transparent and backed by tangible achievements by the COP President and his team.”
“The COP President is clear that phasing down and out of fossil fuels is inevitable and that we must keep 1.5C within reach,” adding, “we are excited with the progress we have made so far and for the delivery of an ambitious (global stocktake) decision. Attempts to undermine this will not soften our resolve.”
Fossil fuels are the main driver of the climate crisis and as the world continues to burn oil, coal and gas, global temperatures are soaring to unprecedented levels. This year has seen record global heat, which has driven deadly extreme weather events.
Fossil fuel production in 2030 is expected to be more than double what would be necessary to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, a recent report from several scientific institutions, including the UN Environment Programme, found. That report used scenarios laid out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to reach its conclusion.
What sea level rise will look like in cities that have hosted climate summits
“If the IPCC and IEA do not count as science then I don’t know what does,” said Ploy Achakulwisut, climate researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute and one of the authors on the report. She told CNN it concluded “that all fossil fuels have to be phased out especially if carbon dioxide removal and carbon capture and storage measures fail to scale.”
Carbon capture refers to a set of techniques that aim to remove carbon pollution from the the air and to capture what’s being produced from power plants and other polluting facilities. While some argue carbon capture will be an important tool for reducing planet-heating pollution, others argue these technologies are expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use.
Scientists and climate groups heavily criticized Al Jaber’s comments.
Romain Ioualalen, global policy lead at non-profit Oil Change International, said in a statement Al Jaber’s statements during the panel discussion were “alarming,” “science-denying” and “raise deep concerns about the Presidency’s capacity to lead the UN climate talks.”
No-shows and walkouts as Israel-Hamas war looms over crucial climate talks
Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London, said he strongly recommended Al Jaber revisit the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
“That report, approved unanimously by 195 countries including the UAE, shows a variety of ways to limit warming to 1.5°C — all of which indicate a de facto phase out of fossil fuels in the first half of the century. Will that take the world back to the caves? Absolutely not,” he said in a statement.
Mohamed Adow, director of climate think tank Power Shift Africa, said Al Jaber’s remarks were a “wake up call” to the world and COP28 negotiators. “They are not going to get any help from the COP Presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase out,” he said in a statement.
This COP summit will conclude the first global stocktake, where countries will assess their progress on climate action progress and work out how to get the world on track to limiting catastrophic global warming.

"Youth climate group urges Biden to declare a climate emergency ahead of 2024, as president struggles with young voters",https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/politics/joe-biden-climate-emergency-2024/index.html,"Youth climate group urges Biden to declare a climate emergency ahead of 2024, as president struggles with young voters
Youth climate group Sunrise Movement is urging President Joe Biden to formally declare a climate emergency and unleash his executive powers to cut back on fossil fuel projects and dramatically accelerate US buildout of clean energy.
The group – which has 7,000 members and 120 organizing hubs nationwide, and is gearing up ahead of the presidential election – wants Biden to stop fossil fuel drilling on federal lands and in federal waters, significantly expand the president’s use of the Defense Production Act to build more renewable energy and direct the US Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute fossil fuel companies for their role in climate disinformation, among other things.
Unlike some other climate groups, they are so far holding off on endorsing Biden, instead asking the president to commit to their goals, which they shared first with CNN.
“Joe Biden can’t both try and win the votes of young people who care about the climate crisis and stand beside fossil fuel companies who are trying to violate our futures,” Aru Shiney-Ajay, Sunrise’s executive director, told CNN. “The reality is, he needs to make a choice.”
While Biden has arguably accomplished more than any president on climate and clean energy in his first term by signing the Inflation Reduction Act, Sunrise is pressuring the president to more aggressively come out against fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, whose pollution is rapidly warming the planet. While US emissions are decreasing, a recent major federal report said it’s not happening fast enough to keep global temperatures from crossing key thresholds.
Biden in 2020 vowed to end fossil fuel drilling on public lands and paused it early in his campaign. But after several legal challenges and IRA provisions requiring new oil and gas lease sales, the administration has resumed auctioning off public lands for drilling and has approved some major new oil and gas projects. Under Biden, US oil exports reached a new record this year, even surpassing exports under former President Donald Trump. Sunrise is calling on Biden to end US fossil fuel exports and is rallying against a massive proposed liquified natural gas export terminal based in Louisiana.
The new Sunrise demands highlight the tightrope the president will have to navigate going into the general election – needing to persuade young people who care about the climate crisis to vote for him again, while also parrying Republican attacks on energy and gas prices.
“Unambiguously, the president has done big things on climate and continues to,” White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi told CNN. “What’s clear to me is the progress he’s made makes him more hopeful and more hungry to take bigger and bolder steps in the years ahead.”
Several of Sunrise’s demands are greatly expanded versions of steps Biden has already taken. For instance, Biden used the Defense Production Act to ramp up manufacturing of energy-efficient heat pumps. The Inflation Reduction Act has also directed billions of private investment into renewables, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing around the country, resulting in new factories and jobs in many states. And Biden has also used other levers of the federal government to address the health and equity impacts of climate, directing the Department of Labor to ensure employers are protecting construction and farm workers from brutal heat.
“I hear the calls for accelerated action on climate and clean energy,” Zaidi said, adding, “I think there could not be a better leader to translate that into action” than Biden.
Even so, recent polls have shown majorities of voters and young voters disapproving of Biden’s climate agenda.
A July Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 57% of Americans disapprove of the way Biden has handled climate policy, including 59% of voters 18-29 years old. Seventy-four percent of Democrats said they approved of how Biden had addressed the issue, but just 40% of independents and 8% of Republicans agreed. Most Americans – 71% – said they had read or heard very little about the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate policy legislation Biden signed into law last year.
Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz drew a contrast between Biden’s agenda and Republicans.
“Instead of ignoring the very real threat climate change poses on Americans’ lives like MAGA Republicans do, President Biden and Democrats are tackling the crisis head on with action, including by passing the most significant climate legislation in the history of our country,” Munoz said in a statement, adding that a second Biden term would “help our country finish the job.”
Sunrise leaders told CNN that while they believe there will be lots of pressure on Biden to carve out a moderate path on fossil fuels during the election, they want to see the president offer bold vision offered by the president.
“This is a really clear signal to the president that you absolutely cannot win this election by appealing to the fossil fuel industry and moderates, who will never choose him over a Republican,” Michele Weindling, Sunrise political director, told CNN. “It isn’t enough to just tell us to vote because you are not a Republican – you have to give us something to fight for.”
Since its founding in 2017, the Sunrise Movement has become an influential youth-led climate group. During the 2020 campaign, the group’s co-founder and former executive director Varshini Prakash helped formulate key points of Biden’s climate change policy alongside John Kerry and Gina McCarthy – who became Biden’s special presidential envoy for climate and first national climate adviser, respectively.
The group also was successful in pushing the Biden administration to create the first-of-its-kind American Climate Corps, a workforce training program to prepare American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience and restoration.
Ahead of 2024, Sunrise’s leaders say their members are more focused on pressuring Biden to significantly slash fossil fuels.
“We have a plan to organize young people in a number of swing states, particularly around the climate crisis,” Weindling said. “We have a significant amount of pressure to put onto the administration to show what we need to see from the president in order to feel mobilized to vote in this election.”"

More than 2,400 people connected to the fossil fuel industry registered to attend the COP28 climate summit in Dubai — a massive representation that’s nearly four times the number that signed up for last year’s climate gathering, according to an analysis published Tuesday.
Fossil fuel employees and representatives outnumber every country’s delegation except for the United Arab Emirates, the host of COP28, and Brazil, according to the report from a coalition of corporate watchdog and climate advocacy groups, including Global Witness.
Overall attendance at the summit has also skyrocketed in recent years, with more than 80,000 people registered for the Dubai meeting — more than twice the number who registered for last year’s summit in Egypt. The report was not able to count how many fossil fuel representatives are actually in attendance, though it has shown registration numbers have been increasing over the years.
The findings are likely to fuel tensions at the already controversial climate summit, where the future role of fossil fuels, the main driver of the climate crisis, is shaping up to be one of the key sticking points.
Climate summit leader defends controversial comments that alarmed scientists and sent shockwaves through meeting
COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, also an oil executive, has argued the fossil fuel industry should be involved in the summit.
“Let history reflect the fact that this is the presidency that made a bold choice to proactively engage with oil and gas companies,” he said during his opening remarks Thursday. CNN has reached out to the COP28 team for comment.
The analysis from the coalition, which this year organized under the name Kick Big Polluters Out, looked at the provisional list of COP participants to identify registrants with self-declared ties to fossil fuel companies or organizations with fossil fuel interests or foundations owned or controlled by a fossil fuel company.
It found an “unprecedented” 2,456 fossil fuel employees and representatives registered to attend COP28, significantly more than the 636 who signed up for COP27 in Egypt in 2022.
This year’s analysis was made easier by the United Nations’ decision in June that for the first time it would require fossil fuel lobbyists to disclose their affiliations when registering for the summit.
Fossil fuel employees and representatives received more passes to COP28 than all the delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries combined, according to the research.
“The hallways and negotiating rooms of this climate conference are flooded with the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists ever,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil fuel energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law.
Governments must “remain focused on delivering an outcome that supports and mandates a full phase out of fossil fuels while protecting public policy-making from fossil fuel interests,” she told CNN. “It remains our only chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 (degrees Celsius).”
Some scientists and advocacy groups have expressed increasing concerns about the ambition levels of the summit after recently resurfaced comments made by Al Jaber in the run up to COP28. In a recorded panel session last month, he told participants there was “no science” that said phasing out fossil fuels was necessary to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.
After the remarks came to light on Sunday, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate goals and science.  At a news conference Monday, he told reporters his remarks had been misinterpreted and that a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuels was “inevitable” and “essential.”
The number of fossil employees and representatives at COP summits has been increasing over the years, according to the annual report. Attendees connected to fossil fuel companies have attended COP summits at least 7,200 times over the last two decades, according to a KBPO report in November."

Follow:
Another strong atmospheric river is set to barrel into the Northwest late Monday and dump over half a foot of rain on the already soaked region, setting off a significant flood threat.
Monday’s storm is the latest in a seemingly never-ending train of atmospheric rivers slamming the region, with each increasing the flood risk more than the last. Several inches of rain and feet of snow have fallen since late Friday, but Monday’s event will transport much warmer air and drench even high, snow-covered elevations with rain, increasing the flood threat.
Flood watches were issued for over 10 million people across the Northwest on Monday ahead of periods of heavy rain set to target portions of Washington, Oregon, Northern California and Idaho through Wednesday. A Level 3 of 4 moderate risk of excessive rainfall was also in place Monday in northwestern Washington.
An atmospheric river directs tropical moisture from the Pacific straight to the West Coast in the form of heavy rain and snow and is the Northwest’s hallmark type of winter storm.
Atmospheric rivers are categorized on a five-point scale, with 1 describing “weak” storms and 5 classified as “exceptional.” This week’s event is considered a Level 4 out of 5, or “extreme,” atmospheric river for much of the Oregon coastline and a Level 3 out of 5 “strong” event for the Washington coast.
The heaviest rainfall will begin Monday evening from coastal Washington and Oregon into the Cascade mountains. Parts of the Cascades that were buried in snow over the weekend may record more than a foot of rain from late Monday through Wednesday.
Outside of the mountains, rainfall amounts in western Washington and western Oregon could climb into the 3 to 6 inch range this week.
This amount of rain is enough to raise rivers on its own, but the impact of this week’s heavy rainfall will be increased because it will fall so soon after the area was deluged with rain and snow over the weekend.
The first atmospheric river of this multi-day event unloaded more than 4 inches of rain from Saturday to Sunday on parts of Washington, Oregon and California, reducing the ground’s ability to absorb more water.
The same event also dumped heavy snowfall across the Cascades and northern Rocky Mountains. In Washington, Stevens Pass recorded 40 inches of snow over the weekend and several other locations in the state recorded more than 30 inches.
Rainfall melts snow, and that melted snow will then flow into streams and rivers, causing even higher rises on rivers or flooding low-lying areas.
As a result, some rivers in western Washington are forecast to reach moderate and major flood stage this week. The Skagit and Snoqualmie rivers are of particular concern, with both forecast to flood roads, farms and even some residential areas in spots.
As heavy rain pours down on deep snow in the mountains, another incredibly dangerous hazard arises: avalanches.
Where’s the snow? These major Northeast metros have gone nearly two years without a significant blast of winter
An avalanche warning was in place over the weekend for portions of Washington and Oregon and it’s likely more will be issued in the coming days.
Heavy rainfall may also trigger landslides or debris flows in areas burned by wildfires because the ground is less able to absorb it effectively.
By Thursday and Friday, storm activity is forecast to scale back across much of the Northwest, but showers and some high-elevation snow remain possible.
There are some early signs in forecast computer models of yet another atmospheric river hitting the region by the early weekend.
The exact strength and overall impact of this potential event should become clearer once this week’s atmospheric river comes to an end on Wednesday.

Multiple atmospheric rivers are expected to roll across the northwestern US over the next few days, bringing heavy rain, feet of snow and strong winds.
In total, more than half a dozen western states are under some type of winter weather alert Sunday, as these atmospheric rivers spread from Washington and Oregon eastward into Colorado and Wyoming.
An atmospheric river (AR) is a plume of moisture that helps carry saturated air from the tropics to higher latitudes, delivering unrelenting rain or snow.
“The Winter Storm Severity Index (WSSI) shows major Impacts are possible in the highest elevations of the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies, likely causing hazardous to even impossible travel conditions in these impacted areas,” the Weather Prediction Center cautioned.
At least 5 to 10 inches of rainfall is forecast along the coastal areas of Oregon, Washington and northwestern California. For higher elevations, as much as 1 to 3 feet of snow is expected to accumulate through the weekend.
An avalanche warning has been issued for areas of Oregon and Washington including Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes, the West Slopes of the southern Washington Cascades, and Mt Hood.
“Very dangerous avalanche conditions will develop over the next 24 hours,” the Northwest Avalanche Center in Seattle said. “Travel in avalanche terrain in not recommended.”
A sequence of back-to-back atmospheric rivers, called an AR family, began Saturday and will continue across this region through Wednesday without much of a break period in between systems. This lack of recovery time will lead to an increased risk for flooding.
“In scenarios where we see multiple atmospheric rivers move onshore in the form of a family, hydrologic impacts tend to be exacerbated due to the lack of time for rivers and soils to recede back to baseline,” said Chad Hecht, research and operations meteorologist at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at UC San Diego.
A level 4 out of 5 AR event is forecast to hit roughly the entire coastline of Oregon.
Not all atmospheric river events are bad. In fact, AR event levels 1 and 2 are considered mostly beneficial rains and are much needed across the western US to build water supply levels. But AR event levels 4 and 5 are more hazardous than they are beneficial as the risk for flooding and travel dangers outweighs the benefits.
“Given enhanced rainfall during the weekend, the soils will be more vulnerable and thus the potential for greater run-off and flooding,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Snow levels are initially expected to be rather high, and therefore western facing slopes of the Cascades may be subject to an additional risk of flooding due to snow melt.”
A slight risk for flooding, which is a level 2 out of 4, has been issued for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday across western Oregon and Washington in anticipation of the excessive rainfall amounts.
Gusty winds up to 50 mph also are likely and could bring down trees and power lines."
What sea level rise will look like in cities that have hosted climate summits,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/03/climate/sea-level-rise-cop28-climate/index.html,"What sea level rise will look like in cities that have hosted climate summits
As global leaders and delegates gather in Dubai for the annual UN climate summit, a new analysis shows how the host cities of previous summits could be inundated — if not entirely submerged — by rising ocean waters.
The relentless rise of planet-warming pollution has already resulted in severe droughts, deadly floods and rapid melting of glaciers and ice around the world. And scientists say the steady climb of global sea level will continue for many decades as temperatures crank higher.
The analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit climate research group, illustrates the risk if countries fail to halt the planet’s precipitous warming trend. A recent UN report showed the world is currently on track to warm up to 2.9 degrees.
Using peer-reviewed sea level rise projections and local elevation from Climate Central’s models, the findings show compelling visuals that paint a stark contrast between the world as we know it and our high-tide future, if the planet warms to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
“Decisions made at COP28 will shape the long-term future of Earth’s coast cities, including Dubai,” said Benjamin Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central.
Climate scientists have reported the world is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, and it’s on track to breach 1.5 degrees of warming in the coming years — a critical threshold beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt.
In 2015, at COP21 in Paris, more than 190 countries approved the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably to 1.5 degrees.
The world’s current trajectory of up to 2.9 degrees could be unlivable for coastal communities, low-lying countries and small island states around the world.
“The survival of these places and their heritage will depend on whether the government and industry leaders can agree to cut carbon pollution sharply enough and fast enough to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius degrees,” Strauss said.
2023 is already set to be the hottest year on record, according to a report released Thursday by the World Meteorological Organization. Each month from June through October set new global monthly temperatures records by wide margins, while ocean temperatures also hit record highs.
These blistering global temperatures are causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt at alarming rates, which adds a significant amount of water to Earth’s oceans. Even Antarctica, the most isolated continent on the planet, is seeing unprecedented melting events. The melting of some large glaciers is now potentially unavoidable and could pose devastating implications for sea level rise globally.
Roughly 385 million people currently live in areas that will be eventually inundated by ocean water at high tide, even if planet-warming pollution is drastically reduced, according to Climate Central.
If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees, sea level rise would still affect land inhabited by 510 million people today. But if the planet breaches 3 degrees, the high-tide line could encroach above land where more than 800 million people live, a recent study found.
But while these scenarios could be centuries away, scientists say with every fraction of a degree of warming, the consequences of climate change worsen.
At COP28, global leaders will discuss how to ramp down planet-warming fossil fuels to prevent the increasing likelihood of an underwater future. This year’s climate talks will also be the first time countries will be negotiating with a new scorecard showing how seriously off-track they are on their climate targets — and how the window to slash climate pollution is “rapidly narrowing.”"
US announces rule to slash powerful planet-warming methane by nearly 80% from oil and gas,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/climate/cop28-methane-announcement-climate/index.html,"US announces rule to slash powerful planet-warming methane by nearly 80% from oil and gas
Follow:
The Biden administration has finalized a rule to significantly cut the US oil and gas industry’s emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas that scientists and climate advocacy groups have pressed nations to rapidly reduce as global temperature soars.
The announcement came amid a wave of commitments at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai on Saturday, including a pledge from at least 117 countries to triple renewable energy by 2030. Vice President Kamala Harris also announced the US was committing another $3 billion to global climate action.
Methane, the main component of natural gas and a byproduct of fossil fuel drilling, is a potent source of climate pollution with more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first two decades in the atmosphere. The oil and gas industry is one of the main sources of global methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.
The new US rule, which will be implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to slash methane emissions by nearly 80% through 2038, compared to what they would have been without the rule. The EPA estimates it will stop about 58 million tons of methane from escaping into the atmosphere during that period – the equivalent of taking more than 300 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.
Interactive: As climate chaos accelerates, which countries are polluting the most?
The rule will crack down on methane leaks from industry in several ways. In a major new development, it will end routine flaring of the natural gas that is a byproduct of drilling oil wells and will phase in a requirement for that gas to be captured instead of burned. The rule will also require stringent leak monitoring of oil and gas wells and compressors, and cut down on leaks from equipment like pumps, storage tanks and controllers.
It will also rely on independent, third-party monitoring – using satellites and other remote-sensing technology – to find very large methane leaks.
EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi unveiled the rule at COP28 on Saturday – a day where cutting methane emissions was a major theme and other multi-lateral announcements were made.
Regan said the US rule signified “strong action” from the Biden administration by “significantly slashing methane emissions.” The US is the world’s largest oil producer, drilling and selling 21% of the world’s oil last year.
“From mobilizing billions in investment to plug orphaned wells, patch leaky pipes, and reclaim abandoned mines to setting strong standards that will cut pollution from the oil and gas sector, the Biden-Harris Administration is putting the full weight of the federal government into slashing harmful methane pollution,” Zaidi added in a statement.
Kamala Harris announces new $3 billion US pledge to global climate action at Dubai summit
Speaking to CNN at COP28, Zaidi reiterated the need for accountability and data on methane emissions is key to enforcement.
“In addition to commitments and transparency, we’ve got to get the receipts – make sure we’re making the progress we need to make,” Zaidi said.
Methane emissions surged in recent years, to the surprise of scientists and energy experts, who are now advocating for capping leaks and ending flaring and venting as easy ways to pump the brakes on the pace of global warming.
Pollution experts and climate advocates told CNN there is plenty of incentive for oil and gas companies to fix the leaks and stop most flaring, since it ultimately means they can pollute less while selling more oil and gas.
“There’s a lot of opportunity,” Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, told CNN. “Companies should want to reduce their leaks because that’s more product. All the incentives should align here.”
The EPA’s plan to end routine flaring is a major step forward, said Jon Goldstein, senior director for regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, who focuses on methane pollution.
“The latest science is showing that flares are not just sources of waste, they’re also large sources of pollution because they’re just not working right,” Goldstein said. “The easiest way to stop that pollution is to stop sending it to flares in the first place. It doesn’t seem logical, why are you burning off this product you can sell?”
50 companies commit to slashing methane
Fifty major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco, signed a pledge on Saturday to cut their methane emissions by the end of the decade, according to an announcement by COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber and the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund.
The new Oil and Gas Compact commits each company to reducing their methane intensity by around 80 to 90% by 2030.
No-shows and walkouts as Israel-Hamas war looms over crucial climate talks
Recent studies from the EDF suggest oil and gas operations worldwide have a methane intensity of around 2 to 3% – this is roughly how much methane gas is released during drilling, venting or flaring, or in pipeline and compressor leaks. The companies are committing to cutting that methane intensity percentage to 0.2% by 2030.
The agreement also commits the companies to third-party verification that they are cracking down on leaks or improper flaring, following international standards set by the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, according to EDF president Fred Krupp.
“Without an iota of hype, this compact is the biggest thing that will reduce temperatures on the planet in decades,” Krupp said in a statement.
Because of methane’s potency, scientists have emphasized in recent years that swiftly cutting methane emissions is key to limiting the climate crisis. Rapid and large-scale efforts to slash human-caused methane emissions could slow global heating by as much as 30%, according to an EDF analysis.
Others were critical of the announcement as not being ambitious enough. Murray Worthy, a senior oil and gas researcher at Zero Carbon Analytics, noted that it doesn’t go further than commitments from previous years, and that “industry has yet to deliver” on those promises.
“Most importantly it doesn’t require companies to deal with the main cause of emissions from fossil fuels, which is burning them,” Worthy said in a statement.
Later in the day Saturday, a group of organizations led by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the United Nations announced it will launch a new program to ensure the 50 oil companies are following through on those promises to reduce methane leaks from their operations.
“The better we can measure problems like greenhouse gas emissions, the better we can manage them,” said Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and former mayor of New York City.
Al Jaber praised the pledge and said it was aligned with the goal to keep the Paris Agreement goal within reach. But he also said “it is not enough.”
“I say with full passion and conviction, much more can be done,” he said.

"What is COP28? The UN climate summit, explained",https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/climate/cop28-dubai-climate-summit-explained/index.html,"What is COP28? The UN climate summit, explained
Follow:
Tens of thousands of people are heading to Dubai in early December for COP28, the annual international climate summit convened by the United Nations.
With time quickly running out to prevent fossil fuel pollution from causing irreversible harm, discussions between global leaders, negotiators, climate advocates and industry representatives have shifted to how the world should adapt to more deadly heatwaves, stronger storms and catastrophic sea level rise.
Despite the widespread impacts of the climate crisis, the annual negotiations have been contentious. The road to consensus on solutions has proven rocky, and has highlighted divisions between rich countries — which emit a majority of the world’s planet-warming pollution — and poor nations, which have contributed the least.
Here’s what to know about the world’s most critical climate change conference.
What is COP28?
A little over 30 years ago, more than 150 countries signed a UN treaty to limit the alarming rise of planet-warming pollution in the atmosphere. While the science behind human-caused climate change was still young, scientists knew even then it would be life-changing.
The first COP — the “Conference of the Parties” to that agreement — took place in Berlin in 1995. Member states have been convening on climate change almost every year since. In 2015, at COP21, more than 190 countries approved the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably to 1.5 degrees.
Although the Paris Agreement was a landmark moment and set the world on a path that scientists supported, it didn’t get specific about how countries should achieve its goal. Since then, COPs have sought to make the plans attached to the Paris Agreement more ambitious and to be more specific about the changes society would need to make.
The controversy at COP28
The climate summit is hosted at a different location each year. While there have been other host countries mired in controversy, the backlash to this year’s host — the United Arab Emirates — has been particularly sharp; not only is the UAE a major oil-producing nation, it has also appointed a top fossil-fuel executive as its COP president.
Critics say it’s a conflict of interest to have Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the UAE’s national oil company, taking charge of the most important climate conference of the year. In facing that criticism, the UAE has embarked on a major campaign to boost its green credentials ahead of the summit, CNN has previously reported.
In May, more than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament called for Al Jaber to step down, claiming that his role could undermine negotiations.
Some key players — including US climate envoy John Kerry — have praised Al Jaber’s appointment. The UAE has rejected criticism that the country is unfit to host the world’s largest climate summit, with the COP28 team previously telling CNN that the UAE was the first in the Middle East to set 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets.
The big names attending COP28
Heads of states and governments deliver speeches in the first days of the summit. More than 160 member nations, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, have confirmed their attendance.
Perhaps the highest-profile attendees will be King Charles III, who will deliver an address at the summit’s opening ceremony.
Pope Francis was planning to be the first pontiff to attend COP, but the trip was cancelled Tuesday following his doctor’s advice.
The Pope’s state of “influenza and inflammation of the respiratory tract has improved,” but the “doctors have asked the Pope not to make the trip planned for the next few days,” Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in a statement. “Pope Francis accepted the doctors’ request with great regret and the trip was therefore cancelled.”
Absent from the speakers list are US President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping — the leaders of the world’s top polluting countries. In mid-November, Biden and Xi pledged to significantly ramp up renewable energy in lieu of planet-cooking fossil fuels, and agreed to resume a working group on climate cooperation.
In lieu of Biden, US Vice President Kamala Harris will attend the summit – a trip that was announced following pushback that Biden was missing global meeting on an issue important to young voters.
Leaders from major oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Russia and Iran, are among those attending.
There are concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could overshadow action on climate this year, particularly in the Middle East. But representatives from both Israel and the Palestinian territories are listed to speak in the first week.
The UAE has also invited many fossil fuel executives to the climate talks, where they are expected to announce new commitments to decarbonize. A list of Wall Street financial heavyweights led by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink will also be present, after missing the summit in Egypt last year.
COP28’s global stocktake
It’s been eight years since the Paris Agreement, yet the world has made barely any progress on slashing climate pollution, and the window is “rapidly narrowing” to do so, according to the agreement’s first scorecard — the global stocktake — which was published in September.
Scientists sound the alarm as the world briefly smashes through 2-degree warming limit for the first time
COP28 will be the first time that countries will be going into the negotiation rooms with an analysis that shows how seriously off-track they are on their climate targets.
“It tells us clearly that the world is not on track to achieve our global climate goals,” Melanie Robinson, the global climate program director for the World Resources Institute, told CNN.
“But it also offers a really interesting concrete blueprint [and] mountain of evidence on how we can get the job done, so it should be a wakeup call of what we need to do but with a roadmap to get there.”
COP28’s biggest issues
Some of the biggest concerns that will take center stage in Dubai are continuations from COP27 in Egypt: finalizing a “loss and damage” fund and discussing how to ramp down planet-warming fossil fuels.
A major debate among the parties has been whether to “phase out” or “phase down” fossil fuels. At COP27, a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels — including oil and gas — and not just coal.
“The most important thing is the outcome at this COP sends a really strong signal that the world must rapidly shift away from fossil fuels,” Robinson said. “I would note that it’s important for the language to refer to all fossil fuels.”
Another focus this year will be on the so-called loss and damage fund, which countries included in last year’s agreement. The fund would help shuttle money from the richest countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of the climate crisis, to poor countries, where the impacts have hit hardest.
The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024. With time running out, a special committee met in Abu Dhabi in early November and recommended the World Bank host the fund and serve as its trustee temporarily for four years.
The loss and damage fund is a delicate and nuanced issue, said Nate Warszawski, a research associate with WRI’s International Climate Action team. “I do think this could be one of the key issues that makes or breaks the COP,” he told CNN.

Climate change is costing the US $150 billion a year. Here’s what that looks like
Follow:
Every three weeks, the United States experiences an extreme weather event that produces $1 billion worth of damage, according to the latest US National Climate Assessment report, released earlier this month. Compare that to 40 years ago, when extreme weather episodes that cost an inflation-adjusted $1 billion happened once every four months on average.
As of November 8, there have been 25 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That exceeds last year’s count — even without data from the last two months of the year.
In total, extreme weather events cost the US $150 billion per year, due to direct impacts such as infrastructure damage, worker injuries and agricultural losses, the authors of the report estimate. And the cost of extreme weather events is expected to grow in the near term with a projected rise in sea levels and temperatures, the report states.
Included in this year’s tally are the devastating wildfires that took place in Hawaii over the summer. The damage from the wildfires, which took the lives of over 100 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, cost $5.6 billion, according to an estimate from the National Centers for Environmental Information, a division of NOAA.
Climate change is impacting the home insurance industry and damaging the housing market
There are also important economic implications. For instance, the authors of the report cited separate research published in April by MIT’s Center for Real Estate, which found that property damage from hurricanes can result in higher mortgage delinquency rates as property owners become more financially stressed. The authors also cited research that found flooding and rising sea levels lower home prices and property values as more people relocate to areas that are less prone to flooding.
Hurricanes in the United States can also strain government budgets since they tend to lead to substantially higher social safety net disbursements, including unemployment insurance and public medical payments, according to research published in 2017 by Tatyana Deryugina, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
The National Climate Assessment report’s estimate of the total annual cost of climate change in the United States takes those factors into account. It does not, however, take into account loss of life and health care-related costs.
$150 billion at glance
It may be hard to appreciate the value of $150 billion without anything to compare it to. That’s why CNN sought to find some meaningful examples.
The $150 billion annual cost of extreme weather in the damage to the US is:

The world has ground to make up at climate summit in Dubai after a year of ‘backsliding’,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/world/cop28-climate-backsliding/index.html,"The world has ground to make up at climate summit in Dubai after a year of ‘backsliding’
Follow:
Climate chaos spared no region this year. Canada burned, the US Southwest boiled, a Libyan city was swept away by floods and global heat was, as one scientist said, “gobsmackingly bananas.”
Climate records fell like dominoes, and more are predicted — it is all but certain that 2023 will be the hottest in recorded history.
And yet, even as the climate crisis inserts itself viscerally into people’s lives, experts say the year has seen alarming backsliding on climate action. Green policies have been watered down, huge new oil and gas projects have been greenlit and coal has had something of a resurgence.
A slew of new reports showed countries are wildly off track on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Instead, the world is on course for warming of up to a catastrophic 2.9 degrees, according to the United Nations Environment Programme — and that’s even if current climate policies are met.
As countries gather in Dubai for the UN’s COP28 climate summit, there are “high expectations,” said Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International. “At the same time, we are seeing much lower commitment from countries.”
They are “backtracking,” he told CNN.
While one year alone cannot determine the success or failure of global climate action, said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the non-profit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, “the world is still not treating this as an emergency, and that’s the fundamental problem.”
Huge oil and gas projects approved
Fossil fuels had a strong year in 2023, with several major projects approved, despite a warning from the IEA two years ago that there can be no more investment into new fossil fuel projects if the world is to meet international climate goals.
“If you’re expanding fossil fuels, you are backtracking,” said Singh.
Yet in March, the Biden administration approved the massive and controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. The area to be drilled holds 600 million barrels of oil, enough to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-heating pollution, according to the administration’s figures. That’s equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads.
The decision “moved us in the opposite direction of our national climate goals” Erik Grafe, an attorney for environmental law group Earthjustice, said in a statement at the time.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the UK announced plans for an expansion of oil and gas in the North Sea in July. The government pledged to grant hundreds of new drilling licenses, in a move one climate advocate described as sending “a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments.”
Fossil fuel expansion by wealthy countries is set to continue long into the future. Just five developed countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Norway — are responsible for 51% of oil and gas expansion planned between 2023 and 2050, according to a September report from campaign group Oil Change International.
“If this oil and gas expansion is allowed to proceed, it would lock in climate chaos and an unlivable future,” the report noted.
Weakened climate policies
An unexpected battle in Europe in early spring over a ban on the sale of new gas and diesel powered cars set the tone for a fraught year for getting new climate policy on the books
The bloc’s law had seemed like a done deal, but Germany objected at the last minute, and added a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars beyond the 2035 deadline — as long as they run on synthetic fuels.
It sent worrying signals about climate backtracking, said Elisa Giannelli, a senior policy advisor at climate think tank E3G. “It’s not just about cars,” she told CNN in March. “It’s about the political signals that that [dispute] sends.”
‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war
Across Europe, there has been pushback on green plans. An attempt in Germany to introduce a law to replace fossil fuel-powered heating systems with more efficient systems that can be run on renewable energy was watered down after widespread opposition was stoked in part by the far right.
In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a dilution of climate pledges in September. The government’s own independent climate advisory body responded by saying it “made meeting future targets harder.”
While many countries insist they are still committed to net zero by 2050 — meaning they plan to﻿ remove at least as much planet-warming pollution from the atmosphere as they produce — “targets are only valuable if they are followed up with implementation,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London.
And “in terms of implementation … there is definitely a backsliding,” he told CNN.
A coal bonanza
Global consumption of coal — the single biggest contributor to climate change — reached an all-time high in 2022, and demand is set to remain near record levels this year, according to the IEA.
In the first half of 2023, China was approving new coal projects at a rate equivalent to two large coal plants every week, according to an analysis from Global Energy Monitor. This coal “spree,” as the report called it, was partly triggered by concerns over power shortages during blistering heat waves.
China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and while the country has made giant strides on renewable energy, experts say its continued reliance on coal threatens its climate progress.
“China is making the path towards its energy transition and climate commitments more complicated and costly,” Flora Champenois, co-author of the report and research analyst at GEM, said in a statement.
It’s not just China. The US may have reduced its domestic coal consumption, but it has ramped up exports. In the first eight months of this year, US thermal coal exports reached their highest level since 2018, driven by demand from Asia.
And in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some countries have turned to coal in the scramble to replace Russian oil and gas. Germany temporarily reopened coal plants and in October, the government approved bringing coal plants back online over winter to avoid shortages.
Experts say this scramble for coal — even if short term — has also strained relations between the West and the Global South.
“The first time that the developed world has a bit of a challenge, they immediately backtrack and they say ‘oh, because it’s exceptional, we’re going to reopen coal-fired power plants,’” Rogelj said.
Fossil fuel companies dialed down green plans
Big oil companies made eye-popping profits in 2022. BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total pulled in a record $199.3 billion that year as they benefited from soaring oil and gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
But the windfall did not translate into huge boosts for clean energy plans. Instead, many announced expansion of fossil fuels and, for some, a dialing down of green pledges.
BP scaled back the ambition of a commitment it had made only three years ago to slash oil and gas production by 40% by 2030. In February, it announced it would instead aim for a roughly 25% reduction by the end of the decade.
Despite record profits, Shell announced in February that it would keep renewables spending steady, despite having increased it in previous years.
Big Oil faces scrutiny after huge jump in profits
And at a June conference, Exxon head Darren Woods said he aimed to double the amount of oil produced from the company’s US shale projects over five years. The company also dropped a years-long project to develop fuel from algae, previously a much-touted part of its green ambitions.
The three companies maintain they are committed to the clean-energy transition.
BP did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but in a February statement, then CEO Bernard Looney said: “We need continuing near-term investment into today’s energy system — which depends on oil and gas — to meet today’s demands and to make sure the transition is an orderly one.”
A Shell spokesperson told CNN “global energy demand will continue to grow and be met by different types of energy, including oil and gas,” and that Shell “aims to play its part in a balanced energy transition, where the world achieves net-zero emissions.”
An Exxon spokesperson said the company was “embracing” the challenge to reach net zero. “We’re doing our part by investing $17 billion in lower-emission initiatives through 2027.”
But according to a November IEA report, the oil and gas industry must rapidly scale up its ambitions. Around 50% of its total capital spending needs to go toward clean energy projects by 2030, according to the report. At the moment, they commit just 2.5%.
“The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible.”
Glimmers of hope
It would be a mistake to suggest everything is going in the wrong direction, Guilanpour said. “You need to think about trajectories, and on those trajectories, you’re going to get bumps in the road.”
The relationship between the US and China has long been bumpy, but its cooperation on climate change has been a glimmer of hope. In mid-November, the countries pledged a major ramp-up in renewable energy, and agreed to economy-wide reduction of all greenhouse gases — not just carbon dioxide — the first time China officially stated its intent to do so.
While 2023 did see backsliding, the long-term pathway is heading in the right direction — albeit much too slowly, said Claire Fyson, co-head of the climate policy team at Climate Analytics, a climate science and policy institute.
Ultimately, the momentum is in favor of a green transition, she told CNN. “In spite of policy rollbacks in many places, the economics just win out,” Fyson told CNN, pointing to the acceleration in renewables like wind and solar.
But, she added, “we’re still in very dangerous territory.”

Follow:
The United Arab Emirates’ team organizing the COP28 climate talks that begin this week was planning to use its position as host of the summit to strike new oil and gas deals with foreign governments, a cache of leaked documents shows.
The documents, which were published by the UK-registered Centre for Climate Reporting, appear to be briefing notes for Sultan Al Jaber — who will preside over the UN climate negotiations — for meetings with foreign officials in the run-up to the summit. They are organized as country profiles, with each document describing talking points for Al Jaber to raise in the meetings.
The documents detail each country’s climate progress in key areas — including finance, decarbonizing food systems, uptake of renewables — and identify how their ambitions could be raised.
But among those points are also several suggestions to offer new oil and gas projects with the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), which Al Jaber leads.
ADNOC did not reply to CNN’s request for comment, but the company previously told CNN that any suggestion it was using the climate talks to promote itself “is incorrect and is baseless.”
The documents were first shared with the BBC.
A COP28 team spokesperson told CNN in an email: “The documents referred to in the BBC article are inaccurate and were not used by COP28 in meetings. It is extremely disappointing to see the BBC use unverified documents in their reporting.”
The spokesperson did not address CNN’s question as to whether the COP28 team was operating independently of ADNOC, nor did they explicitly deny that business interests were discussed.
The UAE has already been at the center of widespread criticism for appointing its top oil and gas chief to preside over COP28. As Al Jaber helms the summit, ADNOC is planning to expand its oil and gas production, according to an analysis from a fossil fuel watchdog, CNN has previously reported. The wider ADNOC Group is expanding abroad in a number of other areas as well, including petrochemicals and renewables.
In addition to documents’ talking points around climate issues and promoting ADNOC are other suggestions to promote projects with the UAE’s main renewables vehicle, Masdar, which Al Jaber also runs.
It’s not clear how many of the meetings actually took place, but the notes offer an insight into how the team hoped to use them as a vehicle for new deals. CNN has reached out to the 15 countries mentioned, three of which confirmed meetings, but said either no business discussions took place or would not confirm if they did. Another two replied to say no meeting occurred.
The US, China, France, Germany and the UK are among the countries with briefing notes published by the Centre for Climate Reporting. The organization said there were 27 country profiles in all, but that it had decided to share 15.
The Conference of the Parties (COP) host country, which changes every year, typically sends its nominated president-designate to meet with foreign officials to try and ramp up climate action ahead of the talks. The briefing notes read as would be expected for such meetings, until the end of each country’s notes, where suggestions to promote ADNOC and Masdar are included.
UN rules say these meetings should not be used to promote the economic interests of the host country. According to the UN’s climate body, the UNFCCC, an elected or appointed COP official should remain “impartial” throughout the process. They are expected to act “without bias, prejudice, favoritism, caprice, self-interest, preference or deference” in the process, according to the body’s code of ethics. “They are also expected to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise or appear to compromise their role and functions as UNFCCC Officer.”
Among the talking points outlined in the leaked briefing notes was that ADNOC was ready to “expand” its provision liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Germany. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a significant contributor to climate change. The leaked notes said ADNOC has already provided some LNG to the country in February 2023 to help it wean of Russian gas, part of Germany’s new strategy since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.
A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects
ADNOC has the ambition to supply up to 25% of Germany’s hydrogen import demand, the notes say. Hydrogen can be made from natural gas, which the UAE has large reserves of.
A spokesperson for Germany’s Federal Foreign Office confirmed the country’s international climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, was “naturally in close contact with the COP28 presidency,” but did not comment when asked twice whether the two discussed LNG, or any potential business with ADNOC or Masdar.
“In her talks with representatives of the United Arab Emirates, she has been promoting ambitious targets for the upcoming world climate conference,” the spokesperson said. “This also includes a commitment to gradually phase out fossil fuels. We are working for COP outcomes that initiate a true course correction towards 1.5 degrees.”
Another document showed a talking point for China centered around ADNOC’s growth supporting energy security in the country, saying that the company was willing to “jointly evaluate” opportunities for LNG projects in places including Mozambique, Canada and Australia.
The UAE wants to be removed from Brazil’s tax haven list, which would allow Masdar to invest more in the country, the briefing for that country showed. They also suggested Venezuelan “resources” could be monetized, since the US relaxed its energy sanctions on the country, and that ADNOC and Masdar could help Azerbaijan become an energy hub for Europe, “exporting natural gas and potentially clean electricity.”
The other briefing notes shared were for Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland. The notes did not suggest oil and gas projects would be discussed with all those countries.
For the US, for example, the briefing notes touch on potential renewable energy deals, saying Masdar hoped to grow its presence in the US by carrying out “acquisitions” in the short term.
The COP28 climate talks come at a critical time, as scientists say the world is “virtually certain” to have experienced its hottest year on record in 2023, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and the Earth is approaching a series of crucial tipping points.
Greenpeace International said that the content of the briefings, if true, were “totally unacceptable and a real scandal.”
“The climate summit leader should be focused on advancing climate solutions impartially, not backroom deals that are fuelling the crisis,” Kaisa Kosonen, policy coordinator at Greenpeace International, said in a statement. “This is exactly the kind of conflict of interest we feared when the CEO of an oil company was appointed to the role.”
“This summit is the world’s most powerful forum to avert the biggest threat to the survival of humankind, and we urge the Presidency to act accordingly.”"

Who can afford to go green? Hard-pressed consumers are pushing back
“All the rich can afford a new car,” an elderly British woman commented at a recent protest in London against plans to expand a toll on older, polluting vehicles to outer suburbs of the city. “It’s affecting so many poor people… Everybody wants clean air but it’s all about money,” she told Times Radio.
Her comments encapsulate growing resistance to pro-climate measures because of the costs they can impose on already stretched household budgets or the hassle they add to daily lives.
Many people have seen their incomes eroded over the past 18 months by soaring food and energy bills and high borrowing costs. Even among those who accept that climate action is needed, rising numbers are unwilling or unable to shoulder additional expenses in these circumstances.
“Across Europe, a backlash against net-zero policy is underway,” Brett Meyer and Tone Langengen at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a think tank, wrote in August.
Net-zero policy refers to measures to reduce planet-heating pollution. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by 2050 on a net basis — in other words, after accounting for emissions released into and removed from the atmosphere — to avoid catastrophic climate change.
“While polls show that an overwhelming majority believe climate change is a problem and support policies to address it, that support starts to fall once green policies come into force and people begin to experience their costs,” Langengen and Meyer said.
Why public attitudes matter
Take two recent opinion polls. In a 2022 Pew survey covering 19 countries in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, climate change was named the top global threat. In Europe, more respondents said it was a threat to their country than at any time in the past two decades.
“The results come as wildfires and extreme heat across Europe cause massive disruption to life,” the Pew researchers wrote in August last year, before another bout of deadly wildfires ravaged Greece this summer.
‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war
Yet, in a survey earlier this year conducted in 29 countries by Ipsos, only 30% of respondents said they would be willing to pay more in taxes to help prevent climate change.
Public attitudes “matter a lot” for reaching net-zero emissions because of the fundamental changes the transition will require, said Anna Valero, a distinguished policy fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
“What we’re talking about is large-scale structural change that will affect people’s lives,” she told CNN. From the way they heat their homes and the cars they drive, to the skills they need to do the jobs necessary for the transition, everything is in flux.
Since citizens are voters, consumers and workers, they will “determine the feasibility of different things,” she added. “There’s a limit to what policymakers can do if the public don’t support their program. And there’s a limit to what businesses will do if the consumers won’t purchase those more environmentally sustainable options.”
One of the most high-profile options is to switch to an electric car. But consumer demand is already waning.
Earlier this month, the CEO of Volkswagen, Oliver Blume, cited a “sluggish ramp-up” of the electric vehicle (EV) market in Europe as a reason for the carmaker’s decision not to build additional battery factories for now, beyond the three plants it is already planning. “There is for the time being no business rationale for deciding on further sites,” he said in a statement.
Sales data compiled by HSBC shows that carmakers in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States are having to offer discounts and cheap financing to counter weaker-than-expected demand for EVs.
‘Moment of truth’ for oil industry: Deepen the climate crisis or help fix it
“In the UK, not only are the discounts on the rise, the activity seems to be spreading to more brands,” the bank’s auto analysts wrote in a note last month.
Backpedaling by policymakers doesn’t help. In September, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak watered down the government’s climate strategy, delaying a ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars by five years among other changes.
Ford (F), which had hoped the government’s earlier timeline would boost demand for EVs, was sharply critical of Sunak’s decision to push it out to 2035.
Sustained discounting may be needed to encourage more motorists around the world to switch to EVs. For example, in the United States, going electric still means paying a premium over the typical gas-powered model: the average price of a new EV was $51,762 in October compared with $47,936 across all vehicles, according to auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.
‘There is no trade-off’
But high upfront costs mask the fact that climate-friendly products such as EVs and heat pumps will likely save consumers money down the line.
The UK government’s own independent adviser on climate strategy, the Climate Change Committee, said delaying the ban on gas-guzzling cars is likely to increase motoring costs for households.
“Electric vehicles will be significantly cheaper than petrol and diesel vehicles to own and operate over their lifetimes, so any undermining of their rollout will ultimately increase costs,” the committee wrote in a report last month.
The same is true of heat pumps. These use electricity to transfer heat from a source, such as the air or ground, and are standard in Scandinavian countries including Norway and Sweden, which have bitter winters.
Because of their energy efficiency, heat pumps would reduce the average UK household’s heating bill by 25% and slash the average home’s carbon emissions by 75%, according to Swedish heat pump firm Aira.
“There is no trade-off between (installing a heat pump), saving the planet and at the same time saving the pockets of consumers,” CEO Martin Lewerth told CNN.
A heat pump is around three to seven times more expensive than a typical boiler powered by natural gas when accounting for both its price and the installation cost. In Britain, even the more generous £7,500 ($9,400) government grant that Sunak unveiled in September won’t fully offset the difference in many cases.
The limited number of engineers able to install and service heat pumps is another hindrance, and also adds to costs.
“If you’re living outside Scandinavia and you want a heat pump, it’s not a hassle-free experience,” Lewerth acknowledged. To address these challenges, Aira, which launched in the UK Monday, is offering monthly payment plans. The firm is also opening “Aira Academies” across Europe to retrain gas boiler installers and turn them into “clean energy experts.”
“Replacing one gas boiler with an electric heat pump will basically mean taking two (combustion engine) cars off the street,” Lewerth said. “Once people understand this is actually cheaper and a better solution… then it’s self-propelling.”
The cost of delay
Conversely, delaying the implementation of net-zero measures at a time when scientists say climate action needs to be accelerated will hit consumers’ pockets harder in the long run — and cost the planet dearly.
“There is no scenario in which delay is the cheaper option with climate change,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the LSE.
“The cost of the transition, while significant, is nowhere near the cost of dealing with the consequences (of climate change).”
In the first six months of 2023, economic losses from natural disasters, which scientists say are becoming more frequent and severe as a result of climate change, amounted to $120 billion, according to insurer Swiss Re. That’s 46% above the first-half average over the previous 10 years.
World isn’t spending nearly enough money to prepare the most vulnerable countries for climate extremes, UN says
In the United States alone, extreme weather events cost the economy close to $150 billion a year and disproportionately affect poor and disadvantaged communities, according to the government. And that estimate doesn’t account for loss of life or health care-related costs.
Beyond the economic damage from climate change, there is also a hefty price tag associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels, including natural gas — as was painfully demonstrated by the spike in European energy bills as a result of the war in Ukraine.
“If we’d invested more in renewable energy… energy bills wouldn’t have gone up so much, which disproportionately impacted on poor households,” Valero at the LSE told CNN.
In a similar vein, cleaner air can have economic benefits. A 2020 study by the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, concluded that expanding London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone — the target of the recent protest in London — would meaningfully boost workforce participation and productivity by improving people’s health.
So it’s clear that weaning economies off fossil fuels, while costly and disruptive in the short term, will deliver substantial returns in the long run.
The job of governments, then, is to ensure that the upfront costs of reaching net zero do not fall on the poor, even if that means that “at some point rich people have to pay more,” according to Tim Jackson, the director of the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at the University of Surrey in the UK.
“We have to think about where the burden of that cost falls now,” he told CNN. “It’s clear it shouldn’t fall on the poorest. That means that if there are costs… even if these are investment costs with returns later on, then to some extent they should fall on people who can afford to pay them.”

How AI could power the climate breakthrough the world needs
Follow:
Programming note: Listen to a version of this story on CNN’s One Thing podcast with David Rind.
Tomato growers in central India have been increasingly worried about the volatility that extreme weather events have brought to the region. For much of the area, the last decade has been punctuated by severe droughts that led to significant crop loss, impacting the livelihoods of local farmers.
On the other side of the world, Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi is developing an artificial intelligence platform to evaluate how vulnerable crops are to warming temperatures over the next two decades. The tool uses data on the climate, water and soil of a particular location to measure how viable the landscape will be for growing in the coming years.
Maharashtra, India, was one of its first case studies in 2021. Farmers could go into the ClimateAi app and input what seed they were growing and where they wanted to plant it.
With that data, ClimateAi ran simulations and found that extreme heat and drought would lead to an approximately 30% decrease in tomato output in the region over the next two decades. It warned growers that they should change their strategy.
The results proved pivotal — tomato producers adjusted their business plans by switching to more climate-resilient seed varieties and shifting the times they plant tomato seeds. Finding new growing locations usually takes a while for farmers affected by climate change, but “now it can happen in a matter of minutes, and it also saves them a lot of cost,” according to Himanshu Gupta, who grew up in India and is the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi.
“The way we think about AI is it’s a time and effectiveness multiplier to the solutions for climate change,” Gupta told CNN.
Better assessing future risks for farming is just one of the ways artificial intelligence technologies are being used to address the climate crisis.
AI first crashed into the public consciousness this year thanks to popular, consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, and experts say the technology is set to revolutionize countless industries. But climate researchers have for years been thinking about how AI — computer programs that can rapidly analyze enormous amounts of data and complete complex tasks in ways similar to how a human might — could help them better understand and address the changing climate.
Everything you need to know about AI but were too afraid to ask
Now, experts say AI is poised to accelerate everything from reducing pollution to improving weather models.
“Efficiencies is one thing that AI is very good at, optimizing decisions, optimizing resources,” said Fengqi You, chair professor at Cornell University’s engineering school. “It’s a system that has very strong predictive capabilities that could be tremendously helpful in many domains, ranging from (understanding) small-scale molecules … to broader climate systems to help us fight climate change.”
With the breakneck pace at which the planet has been warming, accelerating the speed at which the world deploys and implements solutions is crucial. But for all of AI’s promise, the infrastructure that supports the technology — data centers filled with rows of powerful, energy-sucking computers — could itself be a strain on the environment. Experts say software engineers must work closely with climate scientists to find a balance.
“It’s definitely something that has to be considered as this trade-off,” said Kara Lamb, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s earth and environmental engineering department. Still, “the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of applying it to these types of approaches.”
Technology that speeds up discovery
Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to various digital tools trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might previously have required input from an actual person. Generally, what these technologies have in common is their ability to rapidly process and find connections among vast amounts of disparate data.
This makes AI particularly good at things like forecasting and running simulations. And unlike traditional computer programs, AI tools can typically continue learning over time as new data is available or as the systems receive new feedback about the quality of their outputs.
While scientific discovery used to be reliant on humans’ ability to gather, observe and analyze evidence, computers can now process large datasets, identify patterns and run digital experiments in a fraction of the time that human researchers would need.
‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war
“For the climate models, fundamentally we’re trying to solve these equations … how these atmosphere models are interacting, and it takes a long time to solve,” You said. Similarly, research on new energy conduction materials, like those for solar panels, could require countless hours of testing that can now be sped up using AI.
“In the past, people used to need trial and error, we’d need … researchers working every day and night,” You said. “Now, because of AI, which doesn’t need to sleep, it just needs electric power, it could keep working 24/7 and it can become very helpful in accelerating discovery.”
AI probably won’t replace the need for humans in the climate change fight. But it could make their work faster and more effective.
Researchers seeking to restore coastlines by replanting seagrass, for example, are using AI to model the best locations to target those replanting efforts, said Dan Keeler, chief communication officer at impact investing firm Newday, which is involved in charitable efforts to support the coastal restoration.
An AI algorithm trained to address the issue could take into consideration everything from toxins in the water or disruptive shipping routes to how replanting efforts could impact nearby sea life or even coastal tourism.
“It’s very difficult to put all those together into a single model with conventional methods, but AI actually makes that much more possible,” Keeler said.
AI ‘doing the dirty work’ in climate research
The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have found. Rising temperatures are melting sea ice, thawing permafrost and igniting wildfires in what should be one of the coldest regions on Earth.
Climate experts have said what happens in the Arctic is a bellwether for the rest of the world. But climate models – which scientists use to predict long-term change – are not capturing how fast it’s warming.
They went hunting for fossil fuels. What they found could help save the world
With the help of AI, Anna Liljedahl, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, can make permafrost forecasts on a seasonal timescale, instead of on the typical 100-year timescale, giving her and other researchers a better picture of how fast the Arctic is melting.
“AI is doing the dirty work,” Liljedahl told CNN. “But AI is not perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore the things that AI suggested.”
The technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be highest, allowing grid operators to “make sure they have power online, ready to supply demand, and also that they don’t have power that’s just being produced and it’s going to be consumed, because that’s obviously a tremendous waste,” said Keeler.
ClimateAi’s Gupta said the problem is figuring out how to integrate renewable capacity into the existing fossil fuel-dominated grid. AI can identify in real-time which renewable energy sources are available in the areas where consumers want it — optimizing consumer demand and supply for renewables.
Elsewhere, AI is also being used to research materials that could effectively recapture carbon from the atmosphere and to model and forecast major floods to help local government agencies better prepare for and react to potential emergencies.
The Cool Down, a media company aiming to help consumers better understand the climate crisis and potential solutions, is set to launch an AI tool early next year that will answer user questions about how to live a more sustainable lifestyle, according to Anna Robertson, co-founder and head of content and partnerships. The tool will use data from its site about what kinds of climate information consumers are most curious about to direct users to information, including answering questions like, “What can I do with my old jeans?” or “I want to switch my laundry detergent, where should I start?”
“Part of the problem is that the issue itself has become so overwhelming and mostly dominated by doom and gloom and not the solutions we have at our fingertips,” Robertson told CNN. “We want to make it easier for people to make better choices.”
Finding the right balance
There’s a downside to all this computational power: Running artificial intelligence models is energy-intensive, and many data centers are operated in areas that are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, Cornell’s You said. Data centers also typically require water for cooling — a dwindling resource in some places where this computing is being done, including the American West.
For now, the amount of energy used to power AI is relatively small compared to what’s consumed by transportation or buildings. “But this is going to grow very fast, and we do need to be very careful at this moment before it grows exponentially,” You said.
An October study from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the “worst-case scenario” suggests Google’s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. Developers should be advised “not only to focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely that all applications will benefit from AI or that the benefits will always outweigh the costs,” the study concludes.
Some data center operators are already beginning to address these concerns.
Amazon Web Services, the online shopping giant’s cloud computing arm, has pledged to be “water positive” by 2030, meaning the company will “return more water to the communities in which we have our data center infrastructure than we take,” CEO Adam Selipsky told CNN in an October interview.
In Oregon, for example, where drought has tightened its grip in recent years, AWS is providing the spent water used for cooling its data centers to local farmers for irrigation at no cost.
The companies building and running data centers to carry out AI workloads can also think about strategically placing them in areas where they might require fewer natural resources to operate, You said. If data centers are built in colder parts of the world, for example, less water will be needed for cooling; Scandanavia has emerged as a popular location for data centers, also bolstered by its relatively robust availability of renewable energy sources.
This controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster
Lawmakers in the United States and abroad — who have in recent months increasingly turned their attention to developing guardrails for AI — should consider both the technology’s potential benefits in fighting climate change and its environmental impact when developing regulations, You added.
“Regulators, decision makers, policymakers really need to think about this when they are looking at the growth of [the AI] industry,” You said. “The growth of the industry is not only about the software, tools and so on, but also how they operate these data centers.”
Tech experts also caution that AI must be made affordable and accessible for low-income nations, particularly those in the Global South that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis yet contribute the least to global pollution, something Gupta hopes to address as he expands ClimateAi’s resources.
“When it comes to AI being applied to climate change,” said Gupta, “I think we are just scratching the surface of the potential that exists both in terms of the impact it could create for businesses, but also the impact it could create at the humanity level.”
This story has been updated to note that Himanshu Gupta is both the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi.

New maps show where snowfall is disappearing,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/25/weather/snowfall-temperatures-climate-change-water/index.html,"New maps show where snowfall is disappearing
Follow:
Snowfall is declining globally as temperatures warm because of human-caused climate change, a new analysis and maps from a NOAA climate scientist show.
But less snow falling from the sky isn’t as innocuous as just having to shovel less; it threatens to reinforce warming, and disrupt food and water for billions of people.
Climate scientists say the future of snowfall is pretty clear: A warmer world driven by human pollution means precipitation is more likely to fall as rain than snow, all else being equal.
It’s possible in the near term that climate change will cause more extreme winter storms and some years of increased snowfall — like the data shows for the Northeast US — but as global temperature warms, there will be fewer of those years, and eventually we could see snowfall amounts fall off a cliff.
“Eventually the laws of thermodynamics mean that as you keep warming you’re just going to transition more and more of that snow over to rain,” said Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with the National Weather Service in Alaska and the brains behind the data analysis in this story. “You can get away with things for a little bit, and it can hide some trends, but overall the laws of thermodynamics will win out.”
Snow also isn’t going to decline linearly, or at a 1-to-1 rate, with rising temperatures, said Justin Mankin, a climate scientist and associate professor of geography at Dartmouth College. Instead, there is more of a tipping point, which would mean that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, “we should expect the losses to accelerate.”
“It means we can expect a lot of the places that haven’t exhibited massive snowfall declines to maybe start to exhibit them with just a little bit more warming,” Mankin told CNN.
There has already been a 2.7% decline in annual global snowfall since 1973, according to Brettschneider’s analysis of data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The downward trend is particularly notable in the Northern Hemisphere’s mid-latitudes — the middle area north of the tropics and south of the Arctic, where the US and much of the world’s population resides.
The sun is more direct there compared to the higher latitudes, especially during spring and fall when it still snows. The white of snow acts like a car’s sun shade, deflecting sunlight and its heat back to space. Without it, more sunlight is absorbed by the ground, warming the atmosphere.
Extreme cold snaps: Why temperatures still plummet to dangerous levels even as the planet warms
Less snow falling from the sky also means less snow piling up into snowpack — a deep, persistent cover of snow that accumulates during the winter. It is crucial for water supplies because it acts like a natural reservoir, storing water as snow during wet times and then releasing it in the form of snowmelt when water is harder to come by, University of Washington environmental engineering professor Jessica Lundquist told CNN.
The threat to water supplies from declining snow is most pronounced in climates subject to more extreme boom-and-bust cycles of precipitation, like the Mediterranean climate found in California and other parts of the American West, Lundquist said.
“California is the poster child — it does not rain in the summer in California, and so the snowmelt runoff, the snow that waits and runs off later in the season, is absolutely essential for all of the ecosystems, all of the agriculture, all of the cities or anyone who wants water during the dry season,” Lundquist told CNN.
Snowpack provides water to more than 50% of the water supply in the arid West, a 2017 study found. The same study predicted snowpack levels in the West would continue to decline by more than one-third by 2100 under a high increase of planet-warming pollution scenario.
As the map shows, the decline in snowfall over the last 50 years has been particularly pronounced in parts of the western US. This trend is in line with other studies which have shown a decline in snowpack at more than 90% of western sites where it is measured.
The increase in snowfall in the Northeast seen on the maps illustrates the complicated nature of changing precipitation patterns with climate change, scientists told CNN.
“Even though the total snowfall trend was positive, the days per year with snowfall trend is negative,” Brettschneider told CNN. This means more snow was falling over fewer days, which could be a sign of the more extreme snowfall events predicted alongside climate change.
As the Arctic warms, nor’easters may get worse
“Your likelihood of snowfall extremes actually increases with global warming and that’s because as we heat up our atmosphere, the atmosphere’s ability to be a reservoir for moisture gets enhanced,” Mankin told CNN. “So you get this countervailing response where snowfall extremes can actually increase with global warming.”
The increase in Northeast snow is also partly because of the time period these maps are looking at Brettschneider told CNN. Snowfall data is much less reliable before the 1970s, but starting the data in the 1970s also meant the analysis included some exceptionally snowy years for that part of the US. Had the analysis started earlier, it might also show a decline, he said.
Managing water with less snow
Understanding the implications of less snowfall on the global water supply is far more complicated than simply saying less snow falling means less available water, Mankin said. It depends greatly on location and a variety of other dynamic snow factors.
The important thing to track for water availability is not the amount of snow, but the amount of water in the snow, Mankin said, which can vary greatly. A light, fluffy snow will have low water content, but a dense, heavy snow will have a high water content.
Additionally, the same extreme precipitation events causing more snow may also mean more rain, which “could potentially compensate those snow losses,” Mankin said.
But the scope of the problem of missing snow is still massive.
Microplastics could trigger cloud formation and affect the weather, new study suggests
A 2015 study by Mankin found 2 billion people who rely on melting snow for water are at risk of snow declines of up to 67%. This includes parts of South Asia, which rely on Himalayan snowmelt; the Mediterranean, including Spain, Italy and Greece; and parts of North Africa like Morocco, which rely on snowmelt from the Atlas mountains.
But Mankin said the study didn’t capture hyperlocal water management, including potential strategies that could mitigate or even replace water lost from missing snow.
“The snow loss becomes a massive management challenge,” Mankin said. “This is not necessarily an insurmountable challenge everywhere, but it is a considerable management challenge, particularly in places like the American West that are heavily reliant on snowmelt runoff.”
Mankin and Lundquist both said more research is ongoing to better understand the nuanced relationship between snow and water supplies, especially at a hyperlocal scale, which will help water managers better plan for a more volatile relationship with snow.
“There’s no silver bullet here – it’s going to be a constellation of solutions and moneys at various scales that can only be conceived after the scope of the problem is understood and identified,” Mankin said.
“To the extent that any of these places are managing water for the status quo — global warming is taking that status quo away,” Mankin said. “To the extent that our infrastructure and our management practices are hard coded to a historical climate — that stuff is irrelevant to the climate that is unfolding.”"

‘Moment of truth’ for oil industry: Deepen the climate crisis or help fix it
Oil and gas producers must confront a “pivotal” choice: continue to accelerate the climate crisis or become part of the solution, the International Energy Agency said in a report Thursday.
The industry currently accounts for only 1% of global investment in clean energy, and continues to pump out disastrous quantities of planet-heating gases, including methane, which is roughly 80 times more potent than CO2 in the near term. If the world is to stand any chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, drastic action is needed on both fronts, and fast, the IEA said.
The warning comes ahead of COP28, a United Nations climate summit starting next week, and as a recent UN analysis shows that the planet is set to heat up by nearly 3 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Scientists predict that warming of that scale could push the world over a number of catastrophic and potentially irreversible tipping points, such as the collapse of the polar ice sheets.
“The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible.”
Introducing the report, entitled “The Oil and Gas Industry in Net Zero Transitions,” Birol told journalists Thursday there are two measures the industry must take to play its part in limiting global warming to the internationally agreed level of 1.5 degrees.
The first is reducing planet-heating pollution from its own operations, such as extracting oil and gas from the ground, processing the fuels and delivering them to consumers. These three activities generate nearly 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions.
“These emissions, including methane emissions, we know that they can be fixed rather easily, quickly and in many cases in a cost-effective manner,” Birol said.
This pollution needs to be cut by more than 60% by 2030 from today’s level, the IEA report says.
Clean investments
The second measure the agency recommends is a dramatic ramp-up in investments in renewable energy by oil and gas companies, which have been “a marginal force” in the clean energy transition, the report said.
The industry invested around $20 billion in clean energy projects last year — only around 2.5% of its total capital spending, the IEA found. That share would need to shoot up to 50% by 2030 to help keep global warming to the less dangerous level of 1.5 degrees.
Such an increase would mean a radical change in how oil and gas firms spend their cash. Between 2018 and 2022, the industry generated around $17 trillion in revenue: 40% was spent developing and operating oil and gas assets, 10% went to investors and just a fraction was invested in clean energy, according to the IEA report.
Oil and gas companies have been investing in carbon capture technologies to remove carbon pollution from the air and to capture what’s produced by power plants and industrial facilities. The captured carbon can then be stored or reused. But carbon capture is “not the answer,” Birol told reporters.
The techniques can play an important role in certain sectors such as the production of cement, iron and steel among others, he said.
“But to say that the carbon capture and storage technology would allow the oil and gas industry to continue with the current oil and gas production trends and at the same time bring the emissions down… is, in our view, a pure fantasy.”
Limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees would require capturing “an entirely inconceivable” 32 billion metric tons (35 billion short tons) of carbon by 2050, the IEA said. The amount of electricity needed to power this process would exceed current global annual electricity demand.
Commenting on the IEA report, Kaisa Kosonen, policy coordinator at Greenpeace International, said: “Industry self-regulation leads to collective disaster, so the real moment of truth will come at this year’s climate summit when governments have the chance to agree to make fossil fuels history, in a fair and fast manner.”

‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/23/climate/climate-culture-wars-europe-us-int/index.html,"‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war
Follow:
It began with a law about heat pumps. It ended with stones being thrown at politicians and a surge in popularity for the far right.
For an example of how climate change is increasingly becoming a flashpoint in the culture wars, Germany is a good place to start.
A proposed law — championed by the Green Party, part of the coalition government — aimed to ban almost all new heating systems that run on oil and gas in favor of more energy-friendly heat pumps.
The backlash was swift and severe. Already stretched by soaring food and energy prices, many Germans feared the law would translate to huge upfront costs for homeowners — fears stoked and weaponized by the populist far right-party Alternative for Germany, or AfD.
Dubbing it Heizhammer — “heating hammer” — they framed the law as an unaffordable luxury pushed by the out-of-touch elite “moving into your house and deciding what you can and can’t do,” said Miranda Schreurs, professor of environment and climate policy at the Technical University of Munich.
“There was a lot of fake news,” she told CNN.
Anger morphed into protests, then violence. In September, Green politicians were pelted with stones during an election event in southern Germany. The next month, the AfD surged in the state elections. Despite eventually pushing through a weakened version of the law, it was a disaster for the government.
As climate solutions and policies move from the abstract to the personal — our cars, our food and how we keep our homes warm — it has created fertile ground for anger and fear, and has fanned the flames of a culture war long in the making.
Those who push these narratives often divide the world into “virtuous” ordinary people on one side, and corrupt, indifferent “elites” on the other, said Stephan Lewandowsky, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol.
A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects
As British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak watered down key climate targets in September, for example, he rebranded himself a defender of motorists against the “ideological zeal” of climate advocates.
“I am slamming the brakes on the war on motorists,” Sunak said in a video posted on X, as he delayed a ban on selling new gas and diesel cars.
Similar rhetoric has been used in other parts of Europe. In the run-up to Poland’s recent elections, the populist right-wing Law and Justice party claimed the opposition wanted to ban meat and force people to eat worms.
Meanwhile, Spain’s far-right Vox party vowed to defend the country against “the new climate religion.”
But to understand why climate change and the culture wars have become so enmeshed globally, experts say the United States probably holds the key.
‘An agenda to control you’
Standing in front of a West Texas oil rig in September, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican candidate for president, described the Democrats’ climate and clean energy policies as an all-out assault on freedom.
“This is all part of an agenda to control you; and to control your behavior,” DeSantis said. “They are trying to limit your choices as Americans, they’re trying to circumscribe your ambitions.”
This rhetoric is dark, but it’s not new. The same speech could have been made by an American conservative decades ago, said Michigan State University sociologist and climate expert Aaron McCright. “And why has it stuck around? It’s effective, it does scare people.”

The origins of the climate culture war in the US lie in the early 1990s, when a new push for global climate action collided with big geopolitical change, McCright said.
In 1992, more than 100 countries agreed to tackle planet-heating pollution in a treaty which was extended by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, compelling major developed nations to lower their climate pollution from coal, oil and gas.
Around the same time, the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving a vacuum for a common enemy among Americans.
“The communist menace that people on the American right have railed against for decades is gone, and there’s no more boogeyman,” McCright said. The environmental agenda was, in many ways, a perfect replacement.
Climate “became the stand-in for everything that’s wrong with the government,” he said. “‘You can’t tell me what I can and can’t do on my land. Federal government — stay away from me.’”
At the same time, fossil fuel companies, which knew about the climate impact of their products as early as the 1970s, according to a slew of studies, pumped huge amounts of money into undermining climate science, Lewandowsky said. “They started a propaganda campaign very early.”
These events shattered a brief moment of bipartisan consensus on climate. Republican politicians — who had previously been mostly aligned with Democrats on these issues — started to vote en masse against climate action.
The public followed In 1992, there was a gap of just 5 percentage points between Republicans and Democrats on support for environmental protection, according to a 2012 study from Pew Research Center. By 2012, that gap had ballooned to 39 percentage points.
“If you went into a coma in ’88 and you woke up in ‘95,” McCright said, “you’d probably wake up going ‘what the heck happened?’”
When it comes to Americans’ views on climate impacts now, “nothing matters more than partisanship,” Alec Tyson, the lead pollster on a recent survey from Pew, told CNN. That poll found 86% of Democrats expected negative climate impacts to worsen during their lifetime, while just 37% of Republicans said the same.
In December 2022, a Democratically controlled Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate bill in US history. It was largely a tax incentive package to encourage people to buy discounted electric cars, electric stoves, solar panels and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems — all carrot and no stick.
Not one Republican voted for it.
Lightning rod for right-wing media
Conservative media has played an outsized role in fueling culture war narratives, according to experts.
When progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced the Green New Deal in 2019, a nonbinding resolution aimed at tackling the climate crisis, it became a lightning rod for right-wing media.
“The most radical, dangerous policy proposal offered in modern history,” “economic enslavement,” an “eco-fascist” proposal — these were just some of the responses in right-wing publications and on TV networks.
How ‘15-minute cities’ turned into an international conspiracy theory
Watching Fox News’ coverage of the Green New Deal, you would think “you were going to not be able to have hamburgers, your travel was going to be radically restricted, your freedom of movement was getting taken away,” said Allison Fisher, director of the climate and energy program at progressive media watchdog group Media Matters.
The Green New Deal triggered a ramp up of rhetoric the right-wing media has been using for years, Fisher told CNN.
Fox has “been laying the groundwork necessary for positioning climate policies as a culture war issue for a long time,” she said. The network’s message has been simple and effective, she added — the “idea that the radical left has manufactured the climate crisis to seize control of every aspect of American life.”
A Fox News spokesperson didn’t return CNN’s request for comment on the characterizations.
This narrative taps into a defining fear of people on the political right, said Lewandowsky, the psychology professor. “If you’re a conservative or libertarian, then climate change is hell,” he said, because dealing with it means taxes, regulation and bigger government, and for some, “that is extremely challenging at a deep, emotional and intellectual level.”
Even in countries like the UK, which tend to be less polarized and hostile toward big government, the conservative media has also been whipping up division over climate, said Ed Matthew of climate think tank E3G.
There has been a “significant uptick” in UK newspaper articles calling on the government to weaken climate targets and “trying to create fear,” he told CNN.
The aim is to make climate action controversial, Matthew said, “and that’s a very dangerous game to play.”
Winning social acceptance
While there is plenty of polling in the US and Europe that shows most people believe climate change is a threat and that they are broadly supportive of climate action, there is still an “incredible gulf” between recognizing the problem and doing something substantive about it, said Jennie King, a climate disinformation expert at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue think tank.
The UK once vowed to be a global climate leader. Now Rishi Sunak is stoking a culture war on green policies
This chasm has become wider as the cost of living soars, with many countries teetering on the brink of recession and there are genuine fears about who will pay for climate action.
The “final mile” — meaning the policies that directly affect people’s lives — is “where information warfare is consolidated now,” King told CNN.
Governments trying to pass climate laws find themselves in a bind: Push bold agendas at the risk of backlash — fueled by those who gain from stoking fear and opposition — or go slowly and put the world even more off track to limit catastrophic global warming and secure a livable climate.
Germany — where, for a moment, a heat pump threatened to tear apart the government — is something of a cautionary tale, said Matthew of E3G. The country tried “bringing in regulation really so fast that people just weren’t ready,” he said, giving far-right parties the chance to exploit it and garner support.
The key to rapidly transforming economies to slash planet-warming pollution will be “bringing society along and winning social acceptance,” Schreurs said. But, she added, “it’s not going to be easy.”"
A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/22/climate/uae-cop28-adnoc-fossil-fuels-expansion-climate-intl/index.html,"A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects
In late September, Zimbabwe’s environment minister signed away control over a staggering amount of land — almost 20% of his country — to a little-known foreign company. Blue Carbon was a small, new outfit, not even a year old, but its chief was no fledgling entrepreneur: he was an Emirati royal whose family had ruled Dubai for 190 years, flush with oil money.
The Dubai-based Blue Carbon has secured forested land nearly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom across five African nations to run projects to conserve forests that might otherwise be logged, preventing huge amounts of planet-heating carbon dioxide, or CO2, from entering the atmosphere.
Blue Carbon can then use that conservation to create carbon credits to sell to companies and governments to “offset” the climate pollution they generate while they continue to burn planet-warming fossil fuels.
The flurry of forest conservation deals with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Liberia and Tanzania were announced in the months ahead of the annual United Nations’ COP28 climate summit, being hosted this year in December by the United Arab Emirates. But according to several analysts and climate advocates CNN spoke with for this story, these conservation deals are the latest attempt by the petrostate to use green initiatives as a smokescreen for its plans to continue pumping fossil fuels.
At the same time, the UAE has said it plans to extract its very last barrel of oil 50 years from now, when its reserves are projected to dry up — decades beyond when scientists say society needs to be done with fossil fuel.
A post shared by Blue Carbon LLC (@bluecarbondxb)
A spokesperson would not confirm to CNN that the company would sell those credits to the UAE, but given Blue Carbon’s chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, is a relative of Dubai’s royal ruler — who also serves as the UAE’s prime minister — the widely held assumption among analysts CNN spoke with is that these credits will be sold to the UAE to offset its enormous carbon footprint. They could also be sold to other oil-reliant nations and companies in the Gulf and beyond. CNN has reached out to the UAE government for comment.
Blue Carbon would not confirm to CNN the area size of all its projects, how much money it has provided in financing or how many credits it hopes to generate. The agreements are in initial stages and not yet finalized.
But the company did tell CNN it would present its deals at the COP28 summit in Dubai as a “blueprint” for carbon trading. The annual climate summit is where global leaders and negotiators from nearly 200 countries will convene to decide how and when to ramp down fossil fuel use. The UAE is expected to use its COP28 presidency to push hard to include carbon removal — not just from forests, but also from oil and gas as they burn and then storing it underground — central solution to the climate crisis.
What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it’s a dangerous distraction
Climate advocates have criticized carbon removal — and scientists remain skeptical of its efficacy — as a ticket for companies to continue to produce and burn fossil fuels on a large scale, even expand, and profit handsomely.
The UAE has a lot to lose, financially. Oil and gas account for around 30% of its GDP and 13% of its exports as of last year, according to the US Department of Commerce. More than 80 countries support phasing out fossil fuels, and renewable energy, like wind and solar, are now so cost competitive in most parts of the world that market forces will eventually squeeze oil and gas out anyway.
Unless, that is, fossil fuel companies and lobbyists can convince the world at COP28 not to rely too much on wind and solar, and to keep pumping oil and gas.
The UAE has already been hit with a barrage of criticism since it put Sultan Al Jaber — who runs the nation’s mammoth oil and gas company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and serves as the nation’s international climate envoy — in charge of the negotiations. More than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament in May called for Al Jaber to be replaced as COP28 president.
Al Jaber sees no conflict of interest in his many roles, he has said in multiple interviews. Nor does ADNOC, which told CNN in an email that there was “no one more qualified,” to lead the negotiations, pointing to his experience as leader of the nation’s renewable energy vehicle, Masdar, as well as its fossil fuels oil and gas company.
Al Jaber has long argued that fossil fuel companies need to be at the table in climate negotiations to ensure the green transition actually happens.
There is a certain logic to the argument, but climate advocates aren’t buying it, pointing instead to all the time the fossil fuel industry has had to show leadership on the issue, but hasn’t. Some fossil fuel companies were among the first to understand their products were causing climate change. That was around four decades ago, yet they continued to profit from coal, oil and gas.
“I think that ADNOC has turned the UN climate negotiations into a giant greenwashing operation for one of the largest oil companies on the planet,” said Jamie Henn, founder and executive director of the non-profit Fossil Free Media, which supports the movement to end fossil fuels. “It’s been clear from the start when the UAE applied to host this COP that one of the main goals of the meeting was for them to try and situate themselves, and their oil and gas industry by extension, as somehow part of the climate solution.”
As of 2020, the UAE was responsible for around 0.53% of the world’s CO2 emissions, according to data from Climate Watch, but with a small population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the sixth-largest carbon polluter per capita. Despite its relatively small population, the UAE was the world’s seventh-biggest oil producer by volume in 2022.
Henn said it was “absurd” that the negotiations had been taken over by fossil fuel interests.
“It’s like the international tobacco control negotiations being run by Philip Morris. Luckily, the UN has rules in place for those negotiations, where they don’t let tobacco lobbyists at the table,” Henn said. “We need that at COP.”
Carbon offsets not a ‘get out of jail free’ card
Never has a COP, which is hosted by a different city each year, had so many apparent conflicts of interest. Not only is Al Jaber wearing leadership hats for climate and fossil fuels, but Blue Carbon is so intertwined with the nation’s royals and rulers, it’s difficult to separate its promotion of carbon offsets from the UAE’s interest in continuing fossil fuel production.
And it will be in Dubai, at COP28, where the rules of how to buy and sell these very carbon credits will be decided.
When asked by CNN if Blue Carbon was looking at more carbon offset deals in Africa, a spokesperson for the company said that “with COP28 around the corner, we will formally announce a few more of our initiatives.” A source with knowledge of the COP28 agenda told CNN the company would use the deals to promote carbon credits as a bigger part of the climate solution.
It’s not a big surprise that so many countries have signed up to work with Blue Carbon. Its parent company, Global Carbon Investments, has already agreed to transfer $1.5 billion to Zimbabwe in “pre-financing for carbon credits.” That’s more than the country spends on education and childcare, which combined are Zimbabwe’s biggest national expense.
With so little money trickling in from the developed to the developing world to adapt to the climate crisis, carbon credit schemes open a new channel of revenue for forest-rich countries.
Cutting down forests or letting them degrade accounts for at least 12% of global planet-warming emissions. It’s their ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that makes them valuable as a climate solution.
Yet the idea of creating tradable carbon credits in exchange for not cutting down forests has been widely criticized as problematic. And some of the world’s biggest companies certifying carbon credits have been shown to use accounting methods that exaggerate their project’s true contribution to mitigating climate change.
In early November, Swiss entrepreneur Renat Heuberger stepped down from his role as CEO of South Pole — one of the world’s first major carbon credit trading companies — after media reports found the company had overstated the climate value of carbon credits that lay in its Kariba forest project in Zimbabwe.
South Pole has denied the media allegations, calling the reports “exaggerated” and “misleading.” In a February news release, the company said, “we strongly refute misleading statements around ‘over-issuances’ of verified carbon credits from one of our flagship climate action projects, the Kariba REDD+ forest protection project.”
A spokesperson for South Pole told CNN in an email Heuberger stepped down because the company wanted “fresh leadership for the job required in terms of (quality assurance) and due diligence processes and controls.”
“Investment in efforts to conserve forests is always welcome. However, the challenge is that conserving forests isn’t a ‘get out of jail free’ card,” said Julia Jones, a conservation scientist at Bangor University in Wales.
“Globally, we need to both stop further loss of forests and drastically cut emissions,” she said. “Using one to offset the other, without very substantial investment in reducing emissions, is problematic.”
Land rights are another issue. In some cases, indigenous and customary landowners have been evicted to clear the way for such projects, as they witness their homes, once deemed nearly valueless, transformed into cash cows for polluting companies and countries.
The Forest Peoples Programme, a non-governmental organization, says that such evictions have become more common in Kenya since it began allocating land for carbon credits.
“Those in control of Africa’s forests stand to earn a lot of money, and corporations appear to be pursuing a new ‘scramble for Africa,’” Justin Kenrick, a senior policy advisor at the Forest Peoples Programme, told CNN in an email. “Meanwhile such ‘conservation’ in Kenya persists with a failed colonial approach of evicting the very communities who know best how to conserve their forests.”
ADNOC to produce more oil than Shell, BP
Whatever the outcome at COP28, the UAE’s state-run oil and gas company, ADNOC, stands to emerge a big winner, especially if it can convince the world that its “Maximum Energy. Minimum Emissions” slogan is a viable climate solution, even as global temperatures soar and scientists press for rapid fossil fuel cuts.
An ADNOC spokesperson did not directly answer CNN’s questions on how many people would represent the company at COP28, but dismissed suggestions the company would benefit from the conference as “incorrect” and “baseless.”
ADNOC is expected to hike its oil production by 41% and its gas production by a third by 2030, compared to projections for this year, according to an analysis of industry data by Global Witness, a non-profit focused on environmental justice and human rights. That translates to a 40% rise in its greenhouse gas emissions, Global Witness said.
The world is planning to blow the fossil fuels production limit that would keep a lid on global heating, report says
The production boost contrasts with plans among other oil majors: Shell’s production is projected to remain largely flat in that time, while BP envisions a 25-percent production cut by 2030. ADNOC, by 2030, plans to out-produce both companies.
ADNOC is starting to look like a new international oil major in other ways, too: It’s expanding its portfolio by buying up assets overseas, such as a gas fields in Azerbaijan, and it has teamed up with BP in a bid to buy a 50% stake in Israel’s NewMed Energy, with a focus on gas exploration in areas including the eastern Mediterranean. It is also buying into projects around renewables and chemicals, the company told CNN.
To limit its carbon footprint amid the expansion, ADNOC said in October it plans to capture 10 million metric tons of CO2 a year from its operations by 2030 — a figure Global Witness found was wildly exaggerated in a recent analysis.
ADNOC currently has the capacity for 800,000 metric tons per year, though it hopes to capture another roughly 3 megatons per year through two facilities not yet completed. Even if those facilities do come online, Global Witness calculates it would take ADNOC more than 340 years to capture the amount of planet-heating carbon it is expected to emit between 2023 and 2030, if it captured both the emissions from its operations and those that occur from using its oil and gas.
ADNOC did not address the calculation in its response to CNN, saying only that it had set its ambition “to achieve net zero by 2045 backed by an initial $15 billion allocation.”
“Before this year, most people would have been forgiven for never having heard of ADNOC. The more we learn about this company — whose CEO remember is charged with making meaningful progress on emissions reductions at COP28 — the greater an outlier it becomes,” Patrick Galey, a senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, told CNN.
“ADNOC plans not only to produce billions of barrels of oil for decades to come, but it is also positioning itself to be among the most aggressive expanders of oil and gas production out there.”
How much the UAE company expands beyond 2030 will depend on what role negotiators see for carbon capture at COP28, and whether it can find new markets abroad. Ironically, COP28 could be the arena that transforms ADNOC into a global oil major.
This story has been updated to reflect that South Pole has denied allegations it overstated the value of its carbon credits, and to include a statement from a South Pole spokesperson on why its CEO stepped down.

Peru has lost more than half its water reserves as glaciers rapidly melt,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/23/climate/peru-glaciers-melt-water-climate-intl/index.html,"Peru has lost more than half its water reserves as glaciers rapidly melt
Follow:
Peru has lost 56% of its tropical glaciers in the last six decades due to climate change, according to a new government inventory released on Wednesday.
Peru holds 68% of the world’s tropical glaciers and warming temperatures have led to melting and the creation of new mountain lagoons that risk overflowing and flooding, the National Institute of Research of Mountain Glaciers and Ecosystems said.
The report uses satellite imagery until 2020 and shows that 2,084 glaciers are covering 1,050 square kilometers (405 square miles) in Peru, compared to the 2,399 square kilometers of ice and snow in 1962.
“In four years, from 2016 to 2020 we have lost almost 6% of these high mountain glaciers,” Beatriz Fuentealba, the institute’s director, said from the Ancash region where many glaciers have disappeared.
According to the inventory, 164 lagoons have been formed or are in the process of formation in the last four years, bringing the number of glacial lagoons up to 8,466, covering about 1,081 square kilometers.
“The new lagoons could be, in the future, water reserves, but being at high altitudes they cause a danger of overflowing and flooding,” said Jesus Gomez, director of research on glaciers at the Ministry of the Environment.
Nearly all of Peru’s tropical glaciers are above 6,000 meters (19,685 feet) above sea level while the new lagoons are at an altitude of between 4,000 and 5,000 meters, the report said.
Almost 20 million Peruvians benefit directly or indirectly from the water that comes down from the glaciers, according to the report.
“This means that we have lost more than half of our water reserves,” said Environment Minister Albina Ruiz, noting that glacial retreat is impacting the natural mountain ecosystem.
“Although we cannot prevent glaciers from disappearing over the years, we can reduce the speed at which they are being lost,” she said, calling for less pollution, more green areas and “above all, recognizing that the mountain provides us with life.”"

A herd of buffaloes wander parched land amidst a drought, a farmer and his cows wade knee-deep through floodwater, and people walk across a bridge over a multicolored river of trash. All three scenes were among the winning images of the Environmental Photographer of the Year 2023 competition, and all three were taken in Bangladesh.
The country is one of the most vulnerable to climate change in the world, ranking seventh on the latest Global Climate Risk Index, based on data from 2000 to 2019. It’s prone to cyclones, tornadoes and floods, and it is estimated that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change.
Bangladeshi photographers like Shafiul Islam believe they have a responsibility to highlight these threats. His captivating image of buffalo depicts the droughts that have struck the north of the country in recent decades. Rivers, canals and reservoirs in the area have dried up, crop production is decreasing and local communities are suffering as a result, he says.
When it does rain, it pours – as shown in 18-year-old Solayman Hossain’s photo of a farmer navigating floodwaters during monsoon season in the Kushtia district, in the west of the country. Brought up in a nearby village, Hossain recounts how he has witnessed devastating changes to the environment in his lifetime. “My village has been hit with frequent flooding and cyclones which damage crops and destroy livelihoods,” he tells CNN.
As extreme weather events become more and more frequent so does the damage, displacements, and anxiety around when the next disaster will hit. “Many of us are forced to keep rebuilding our lives, often in the aftermath of each calamity,” he says.
Photography on the frontlines
Now in its 16th year, the photo competition – organized by streaming platform WaterBear and the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and in partnership with Nikon – attracted thousands of submissions from over 159 countries. So it may seem surprising that three of the six category winners hailed from one country.
Sam Sutaria, CEO of WaterBear, believes it’s down to the country’s relationship with climate issues. “Bangladesh is a place where the climate crisis isn’t an abstract concept but a harsh and immediate reality. With frequent flooding, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events, it’s no wonder they’re so engaged in documenting these challenges,” he says.
He adds that this year’s competition saw entries from other regions also severely threatened by climate change, such as India, West Bengal, Antarctica and Argentina. “(It proves) that photographers on the front lines of these crises are using their lenses as a force for change. They’re inspiring awareness and action by showcasing the pressing issues they face daily.”
Jahid Apu, a professional photographer from Bangladesh, took the drone shot of a bridge in the capital Dhaka surrounded by plastic waste that won the “MPB vision of the future” category. With the image, he wants to communicate the impact of plastic pollution and hopes that when people see it, they might realize the consequence of throwing away plastic and change their behavior.
Ten photographs that made the world wake up to climate change
“I do not take pride in a photo that someone looks at and says, ‘Wow, pretty picture…’ and moves on. For me, success is achieved when I catch the person off guard, drawing consciousness about causes, or when someone comes to me to tell me what the photograph brings to mind,” Apu tells CNN.
Sutaria believes that the winning images from this year’s prize represent a wider shift in environmental photography, away from simply portraying nature as an untouched paradise to images that carry a conservation message.
“They’re showing it in all its raw, vulnerable glory, challenging us to step up and protect it,” he says. “These photographs represent a dynamic new wave in climate storytelling.”"

This Moroccan startup is growing crops in the desert
Climate change means desertification is a growing problem, with 250 million people directly impacted by the degradation of formerly fertile land.
The issue affects a third of the Earth’s land surface, according to the United Nations, parching parts of Africa, South America, southern Europe, China and a third of US soil. Reclaiming arid land and turning it back into agricultural fields could be key to ensuring we are able to feed the planet’s population.
Sand to Green is a Moroccan startup that can transform a patch of desert into a sustainable and profitable plantation in five years, according to Wissal Ben Moussa, its co-founder and chief agricultural officer.
“Desertification is the future of a lot of countries today,” she says. “Our solution is using agroforestry to create a new kind of agriculture that is sustainable and that can be resilient in front of climate change.”
The system can be deployed anywhere near a source of brackish water, which Sand to Green desalinates using solar-powered technology. It then plants a variety of fruit-producing trees and herbs in the same space — a practice known as intercropping — and drip-irrigates their roots directly with the desalinated water, to minimize evaporation.
The soil is regenerated using what Sand to Green calls “green manure,” a mixture that includes compost, biochar and microorganisms that help the soil “wake up,” according to Ben Moussa. Biochar is a form of charcoal that can help arid soils retain water.
This allows some herbs to be ready for harvest after just two years.
In a five-hectare trial in southern Morocco that’s been running since 2017, Sand to Green has tried out a variety of plants in search of the best perfomers. “My top three favorite trees are carob, fig and pomegranate,” Ben Moussa says. “They are endemic to the regions where we want to deploy, have high added value when it comes to the produce, but they are also very resilient.”
Among the intercropping herbs that have been successfully trialed are rosemary, geranium, vetiver and citronella, which Ben Moussa describes as “very low-maintenance and very high-margin.”
Reviving the desert
A 2018 review by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification found that the global economy was set to lose $23 trillion by 2050 because of land degradation, while taking urgent action would cost only a fraction of that — $4.6 trillion. Land degradation or drought affect 169 countries, with Asia and Africa the hardest-hit.
Efforts to grow crops in desert environments are spreading. The International Center for Biosaline Agriculture is growing salt-tolerant superfoods in the sandy soil of Dubai, while in Tanzania, non-profits are using mounds of earth known as bunds to trap water so that it can penetrate parched ground, allowing grasses to return.
Sand to Green is now working to scale up to a 20-hectare commercial proof-of-concept site, also in southern Morocco. It says a site of that size would cost around €450,000 ($475,000) to set up and would start bringing financial returns in about five years.
“With this system we create biodiversity, which means better soil, healthier crops and a bigger yield,” Ben Moussa says. “Our plantation can generate 1.5 times more yield and thus more revenue than a monoculture plantation in the same area.”
When commercialized, each piece of land will be divided into plantations that will be provided as a “green investment,” Ben Moussa says, with Sand to Green handling every step from inception to fruition. Revenues will be shared between the investors and Sand to Green.
Earlier this year, the company raised $1 million in seed funding, and there are plans for an additional, 500-hectare project, again in Morocco.
Sand to Green says its techniques could be used in countries including Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, Egypt, in the Arabian peninsula, some parts of the United States, and on the Mexican coast. “We can go anywhere in the world as long as we have access to brackish water,” Ben Moussa says. “The good news is that there is a lot of it along coastal areas.”

Scientists sound the alarm as the world briefly smashes through 2-degree warming limit for the first time,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/climate/2-degree-warming-limit-record-copernicus-climate-int/index.html,"Scientists sound the alarm as the world briefly smashes through 2-degree warming limit for the first time
The Earth’s temperature briefly rose above a crucial threshold that scientists have been warning for decades could have catastrophic and irreversible impacts on the planet and its ecosystems, data shared by a prominent climate scientist shows.
For the first time, the global average temperature on Friday last week was more than 2 degrees Celsius hotter than levels before industrialization, according to preliminary data shared on X by Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, based in Europe.
The threshold was crossed just temporarily and does not mean that the world is at a permanent state of warming above 2 degrees, but it is a symptom of a planet getting steadily hotter and hotter, and moving towards a longer-term situation where climate crisis impacts will be difficult — in some cases impossible — to reverse.
Provisional ERA5 global temperature for 17th November from @CopernicusECMWF was 1.17°C above 1991-2020 - the warmest on record.Our best estimate is that this was the first day when global temperature was more than 2°C above 1850-1900 (or pre-industrial) levels, at 2.06°C. pic.twitter.com/jXF8oRZeip
“Our best estimate is that this was the first day when global temperature was more than 2°C above 1850-1900 (or pre-industrial) levels, at 2.06°C,” she wrote.
Burgess said in her post that global temperatures on Friday averaged 1.17 degrees above 1991-2020 levels, making it the warmest November 17 on record. But compared to pre-industrial times, before humans began burning fossil fuels on a large scale and altering the Earth’s natural climate, the temperature was 2.06 degrees warmer.
The breach of 2 degrees on Friday came two weeks before the start of the UN COP28 climate conference in Dubai, where countries will take stock of their progress towards the Paris Climate Agreement pledge to limit global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of limiting it to 1.5 degrees.
No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe
One day above 2 degrees of warming “does not mean that the Paris Agreement has been breached,” Burgess told CNN, “but highlights how we are approaching those internationally agreed limits. We can expect to see increasing frequency of 1.5 degree and 2 degree days over the coming months and years.”
Copernicus’ data is preliminary and will require weeks to be confirmed with real-life observations.
The world already looks on track to breach 1.5 degrees of warming on a longer-term basis in the next few years, a threshold beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt.
A UN report published Monday showed that even if countries carried out their current emissions-reduction pledges, the world would reach between 2.5 and 2.9 degrees of warming sometime this century.
But 1.5 is not a cliff edge for the Earth — every fraction of a degree it warms above that, the worse the impacts will be. Warming to 2 degrees puts far more of the population at risk of deadly extreme weather and increases the likelihood of the planet reaching irreversible tipping points, such as the collapse of the polar ice sheets and the mass death of coral reefs.
Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading in the UK, called the breach a “canary in the coalmine” which “underscores the urgency of tackling greenhouse gas emissions.”
But he added that it was “entirely expected that single days will surpass 2 degrees above pre-industrial well before the actual 2 degrees Celsius target is breached over many years.”
The data comes on heels of the hottest 12 months on record, and after a year of extreme weather events, supercharged by the climate crisis, including fires in Hawaii, floods in northern Africa and storms in the Mediterranean, all of which have claimed lives.
Scientists are increasingly expressing alarm that data on temperatures are exceeding their predictions.
A string of reports checking the health of the Earth’s climate and humans’ actions to combat it in recent weeks show that the planet is careening toward a dangerous level of warming, and not doing enough to mitigate or adapt to its impacts.
A UN report last week found that according to countries’ climate plans, planet-heating pollution in 2030 will still be 9% higher than it was in 2010. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to decrease emissions by 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 to have any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An increase of 9% means that target is way off.
Another UN report also found that the world is planning to blow the fossil fuels production limit that would keep a lid on global heating. By 2030, countries plan to produce more than twice the limit of fossil fuels that would cap warming at 1.5 degrees."
"As Earth’s temperature rises, so do deaths among people with mental health problems",https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/17/health/mental-health-climate-change-effects-wellness/index.html,"As Earth’s temperature rises, so do deaths among people with mental health problems
Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.
As the climate crisis gets worse, we know of farmers whose crops are drying up and people who lose their homes due to rampant wildfires.
But there’s another group for whom the climate crisis is a potentially lethal threat — people with mental health problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or anxiety.
And this threat has already become reality for some people. During a record-breaking heat wave in British Columbia in June 2021, 8% of people who died from the extreme heat had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to a March study. That made the disorder a more dangerous risk factor than all other conditions the authors studied, including kidney disease and coronary artery disease.
“Until climate change gets under control, things are only going to get worse unfortunately,” said Dr. Robert Feder, a retired New Hampshire-based psychiatrist and the American Psychiatric Association’s representative to the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “As the temperature keeps increasing, these effects are going to be magnified. There’s going to be more storms, more fires, and people are going to be more worried about what could happen because a lot more things are happening.”
Rising temperatures have also been associated with suicide attempts and increased rates of mental health-related emergency department visits, several studies have found. And long-term exposure to air pollution — which the climate crisis can worsen by adding more particles from droughts or wildfires — has been linked with elevated anxiety and an increase in suicides.
What’s going on in the brains of people with schizophrenia or other conditions is just one factor that makes them more vulnerable to extreme heat, air pollution and stress, experts said — and in need of support from loved ones, surrounding communities and policymakers.
What makes some psychiatric patients more susceptible to the harms of extreme heat — such as heatstroke or death — begins in a part of the brain called the anterior hypothalamus. Think of it as the body’s thermostat.
“That’s the part of the brain that is working to tell you — when you’re too hot or you’re too cold — to begin shivering, to begin sweating,” which is the body’s cooling mechanism, said Dr. Peter Crank, an assistant professor in the department of geography and environmental management at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Crank was the lead author of a March study on associations between temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona, and hospital admissions of people with schizophrenia.
Using marijuana during pregnancy may heighten risk for baby
“It tells the rest of your brain you need to take behavioral action, like drinking water or putting on a coat when it’s too cold or taking off a coat when it’s warm,” he added. “These disorders, whether it’s bipolar, schizophrenia or manic depressive — all three of them impair the neurotransmission of information to that portion of the brain.”
The capacity to regulate body temperature may also have to do with brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which are generally lower in the brains of people with these disorders, experts said.
“The hypothalamus is directly dependent upon being stimulated by serotonin,” said Dr. Joshua Wortzel, a psychiatrist at Bradley Hospital at Brown University in Rhode Island and chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s committee on climate change and mental health. “Serotonin levels in the brain are affected by temperatures outside, and so you can imagine that when we’re playing around with serotonin levels in the brain with our medicines, that can change a person’s ability to sweat.”
Some medications used to treat these disorders can add to the risk by affecting the ability to sweat or raising the body’s core temperature.
Antipsychotic medications — often used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, paranoia and delusions — have the greatest effect, Feder said. Those include aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and lurasidone.
Some stimulant medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, such as lisdexamfetamine and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts, and anti-anxiety medications can also cause this problem.
Single-use plastic is wreaking havoc on the planet. Here’s what you can do to minimize your impact
Lithium, a mood-stabilizing medicine, can cause dehydration, Feder added.
Lifestyle habits important for managing mental health symptoms can also take a hit. Warm temperatures can also interfere with sleep, an important factor for managing mental health symptoms, experts said.
Additionally, “the nature of most mental health conditions is that once you’re diagnosed with it, you are at risk for recurrent episodes of that illness,” Feder said. “And these episodes are often brought on by some type of stress. And climate disasters are certainly a stress.”
Homelessness is also high among people with mental health conditions, especially in the schizophrenic population.
“And if you’re homeless during a heat wave, that puts you at increased risk for death, because you don’t have access to air-conditioning,” Feder said.
Behaviors caused by these conditions can also contribute to a higher risk of heat-related illness or death. The psychosis that people with schizophrenia can experience, for example, can mean they’re not correctly interpreting reality, so “they may not even be aware that they’re overheated, or they may think that the source of their being overheated is due to some bizarre or irrational reason and not do something appropriate to get out of the heat or to make themselves (safer),” Feder said.
People with mental health issues are also more likely to self-medicate with drugs that interfere with their body’s ability to sense and respond to heat.
If you’re on any of these medications and think no longer taking them is the solution, not so fast. “That would be far worse than staying on the medicine,” which plays a crucial role in your treatment, Wortzel said.
Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Here’s how to reduce your use
Talk with your doctor about whether a medication you’re on or starting makes you more vulnerable to extreme heat since some informational pamphlets for these drugs may not list that risk as a potential side effect.
“These are rather just cautions,” he added, “to really just make sure that you’re staying in cooler environments, making sure you’re hydrated — that if climate change continues to get worse, this is going to be really a side effect that we’re going to have to worry more and more about.”
It’s not a reason to stop taking antipsychotics, Wortzel said, but it’s good reason to take care of yourself in the heat.
Addressing the climate crisis, the root of the problem, is of course the most important solution, Wortzel said. What’s also necessary at the policy level, he added, is expanding access to cooling centers and other resources, and providing more funding for research that would help us better understand the impact of heat on mental health.
Holiday gift giving is rife with waste. Here’s how to give greener, according to experts
There are steps individuals and communities can take to protect vulnerable people when hot weather comes.
“Patients need to be aware that they are vulnerable to stress,” Wortzel said. “You need to make sure that you have access to air-conditioning, a cooling center, to stay hydrated and to make sure you’re monitoring how much you’re outside, (that) you’re not out in the hottest times of the day, things like that.”
Wear sunscreen, hats and light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, Crank said. Taking cold showers can also help keep your core temperature down.
“The other thing that people can do is start getting involved in climate activities,” Feder said. “For the anxiety that’s associated with climate change, the best thing people can do is actually get involved in climate (advocacy) groups and start working for changes to the climate crisis.”
Feder also suggested people write or talk to their lawmakers about the issue.
You should also inform your loved ones of your vulnerabilities so they can offer support.
If you’re not someone at greater risk and are wondering how you can help, practice empathy and awareness by keeping water bottles in your car to hand out to those at higher risk of harm from extreme heat.
“Take the time to, if seeing someone in distress, call some sort of emergency services so that they can get medical attention,” Crank said. Doing so will likely take only a few minutes out of your day.

US and China pledge to ramp up renewables in place of planet-warming fossil fuels ahead of Biden-Xi summit,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/15/world/us-china-climate-announcement-summit-intl-hnk/index.html,"US and China pledge to ramp up renewables in place of planet-warming fossil fuels ahead of Biden-Xi summit
Follow:
The United States and China have agreed to resume a working group on climate cooperation and pledged a major ramp-up of renewable energy, the two sides announced Wednesday ahead of a leaders’ summit in San Francisco, as the world’s two largest polluters seek to overcome their geopolitical tensions to tackle the climate crisis.
The announcement came hours before US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to sit down on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit for their first talk in a year – a highly anticipated meeting aimed at stabilizing rocky relations.
Cooperation on climate change has long been seen as a rare bright spot in an otherwise difficult US-China relationship strained by tensions over trade, technology, human rights and geopolitics. But even that bright spot had dimmed over the past year, with Beijing cutting off climate talks with Washington in retaliation for a high-level US visit to Taiwan last summer.
The statement on Wednesday, released separately by the US State Department and China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, followed days of meetings between US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the Sunnylands retreat in California earlier this month. The two envoys also met in Beijing for talks this summer.
What Joe Biden hopes to get from his high-stakes meeting with Xi Jinping
The two sides decided to “operationalize” a suspended bilateral working group to “engage in dialogue and cooperation to accept concrete climate actions” in this decade, according to the statement. That working group was first proposed by Kerry and Xie in 2021 at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, but has been on hold since August last year.
The statement also vows a major ramp-up of renewable energy including wind, solar, and battery storage to help run each country’s massive power sector – specifically to take the place of planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
China and the US committed to “sufficiently accelerate renewable energy deployment” in their economies until the end of 2030 to speed up “the substitution for coal, oil and gas.” They also pledged to support efforts to “triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030,” and said they plan to meaningfully reduce emissions from their power sector within this decade.
Both countries agreed to economy-wide reductions of all greenhouse gases in their international climate commitments for 2035, including carbon dioxide, methane and hydrofluorocarbons. The agreement involves attempting to cut emissions in line with keeping global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius – a crucial threshold above which scientists say climate change effects such as heatwaves and droughts will become difficult for humans and entire ecosystems to adapt to.
The statement marks the first time China has officially stated its intent to control the release of all greenhouse gas emissions – not just carbon dioxide as outlined in its current climate goals, said a Chinese climate scholar in Beijing, who spoke on the condition of anominity as he did not obtain approval to speak to the media.
Methane in particular is a greenhouse gas that scientists have homed in on in recent years as one to target for reduction, as its warming power is roughly 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term. Last week, China produced a plan to reduce its methane emissions, though experts have criticized it as weak and lacking no firm targets.
No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe
“Under the current political environment, both parties have tried their best to find some practical and feasible points that can be advanced. It is very pragmatic,” the climate scholar in Beijing said.
Li Shuo, the director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said China’s pledge to set release targets for all greenhouse gas emissions was arguably the most notable point in the statement.
“Carbon dioxide is only one of the greenhouse gases. Non-carbon dioxide gases such as methane still account for a considerable share of China’s greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.
“If you don’t include them, you’re not actually covering a significant portion of the country’s entire emissions.”
China had previously committed to peaking its emissions “before 2030,” but has not specified exactly when it would do so. But there are signs that the country’s rapid buildout of wind and solar could be starting to displace coal; a Carbon Brief analysis released this week said China’s emissions could start to fall next year – and could portend a broader shift downward.
Still, even with the promises of a significant ramp-up of renewables, there were no explicit words from China on whether it would phase out or phase down its use of coal – the most polluting form of fossil fuel.
Countries’ emissions plans put the world ‘wildly off track’ to contain global heating, UN assessment shows
The Sunnylands statement also comes three weeks before the annual UN climate conference known as COP28, which is being held this year in Dubai. Other countries are frequently watching for signs of cooperation between the world’s two biggest emitters – which can set the tone and pace for the annual conference.
Li, at the Asia Society, said the Sunnylands statement was a “timely effort of aligning the US and China” ahead of COP28, as their engagement is “a precondition for meaningful global progress.”
But he said the challenging US-China relationship meant the climate agreement between them would only be “floor setting”, not “tone setting” – and COP 28 has its work cut out for it.
“The US-China talks will help stabilize the politics when countries meet in the UAE, but critical issues such as fossil fuel phase out still require much political efforts. China also needs to consider what further ambition can be brought to the COP. Stopping the approval of new coal power projects is a good next step,” he added."
"Microplastics could trigger cloud formation and affect the weather, new study suggests",https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/15/weather/microplastic-pollution-weather-study-climate/index.html,"Microplastics could trigger cloud formation and affect the weather, new study suggests
Follow:
Microplastics are turning up in unusual places increasingly often as they filter into nearly every facet of life on Earth. They’ve been discovered in drinking water, food, air and even in blood. Now, scientists have found that these tiny particles might even be able to influence the weather.
Researchers reported Wednesday they detected microplastics in a majority of cloud samples taken from a mountaintop in China, in a study published in the American Chemical Society’s Environmental Science & Technology Letters.
The study traced how the microplastics ended up at their final location and discovered that they could play a role in cloud formation.
What are microplastics?
Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic that are no larger than five millimeters, which is about the size of a single sesame seed. And they are everywhere, according to Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, a group working to end plastic pollution.
“Microplastics are in the air we breathe, they’re in our drinking water, they’re in our bodies,” Enck told CNN.
Microplastics form when larger plastics break down, either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces.
“If it’s plastic, you’re going to get microplastics sooner or later,” Enck said.
The smaller a microplastic is, the easier it can move through environmental cycles – like the water cycle – and ultimately end up in the human body, where its effects are worrisome but still unclear.
Most experts believe more research is needed to determine the full impact of microplastics on human health, but studies have shown that there are already some demonstrable adverse health impacts.
How could microplastics affect the weather?
The authors of Wednesday’s study found microplastics affect cloud formation, and clouds are of huge importance to the weather we experience.
Clouds produce precipitation in the form of rain, snow and everything in between. They also block sunlight, and less solar radiation means cooler temperatures.
In order for a cloud to form, water vapor – a gas – needs to turn into water droplets – a liquid. Then, many water droplets need to come together to become a cloud.
Water droplets form when water vapor interacts with tiny solid particles in the atmosphere, like dust, ash or salt from the ocean. According to the study, microplastics can now be added to that list.
Highest ever concentration of microplastics found on sea floor
These particles are hydrophilic, which means they are attracted to water. Once the first water droplets cling to microplastics and other tiny particles, more water droplets are pulled together and clouds form.
The process is akin to how a single spark can eventually set an entire field ablaze: One tiny particle in the atmosphere can set into motion a process that becomes something much bigger.
According to the study’s authors, further research must be completed to fully understand the extent to which microplastics influence cloud formation.
Could a greater concentration of microplastics lead to more clouds? Will an increase in clouds lead to more precipitation or larger swaths of cooler conditions? These questions remain unanswered.
How do microplastics get into the atmosphere?
Microplastics are tiny and light enough to get picked up by the wind and hoisted into the atmosphere.
The study’s authors found samples of microplastics in the air over Mount Tai in China, and developed computer models to recreate the journey those particles would have had to take to end up there. The models suggested that the flow of air from nearby highly populated inland Chinese cities served as a major source of the microplastics.
This suggests microplastics produced at ground level were lofted and carried large distances.
There are more microplastics found in cities than rural areas, in general, since a higher population density often leads to a higher demand for plastic products. However, rural areas are quickly catching up with microplastic production, according to Enck."
Health experts say world needs to end fossil fuel use as new report finds a rise in climate-related mortality,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/climate/lancet-countdown-report-climate-health/index.html,"Health experts say world needs to end fossil fuel use as new report finds a rise in climate-related mortality
The climate crisis is carrying a mounting health toll that is set to put even more lives at risk without bold action to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels, a new report from more than 100 scientists and health practitioners found.
The annual Lancet Countdown report, released Tuesday, found that delaying climate action will lead to a nearly five-fold increase in heat-related deaths by 2050, underscoring that the health of humans around the world is “at the mercy of fossil fuels.”
Despite these growing health hazards and the costs of adapting to climate change soaring, authors say governments, banks and companies are still allowing the use of fossil fuels to expand and harm human health.
“We’re seeing that we’re moving in the opposite direction to where we should be going with the expansion of private companies’ oil and gas production plans, financing going toward the fossil fuel sector, and all in all a promotion of oil and gas burning that is threatening our survival around the world,” Marina Romanello, Lancet Countdown’s executive director and lead author, told CNN.
No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe
“Mortality is just the tip of the iceberg of the enormous burden that comes with heat,” she added.
If the world continues down this fossil fuel-dependent path, Romanello stressed that the cascading consequences could be catastrophic not only for human health but also the economy.
The planet has already warmed roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era in the late 1800s. When the world is 2 degrees warmer, the report found countries will start to see a 50% increase in labor capacity loss because of exposure to extreme heat, which could lead to enormous economic losses and losses to livelihoods and wellbeing.
More than half a billion more people in the world will suffer food insecurity by mid-century, the report found, if the planet warms 2 degrees.
“The underlying message is that we need to pursue efforts urgently to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees, but that every fraction of a degree of temperature increase matters,” Romanello said.
But even today with a 1.2-degree increase, large parts of the globe have already witnessed a sinister cocktail of devastating impacts.
During Europe’s hottest summer on record in 2022, nearly 62,000 people have died of heat-related causes. That year, every person around the world on average was exposed to 86 days of health-threatening, scorching temperatures, 60% of which were twice as likely to happen by human-caused climate change, according to the report.
That trend persisted — if not, worsened — this summer, with vast swaths of the world experiencing firsthand how dangerous extreme heat can be. In the US, officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, reported that more than 579 people have died of heat-related illness this year, with over 50 deaths still under investigation, making 2023 the deadliest year for heat deaths since the county began tracking them in 2006.
Heat-related fatalities have risen dramatically in the US in recent years. In 2022, more than 1,700 deaths were due to heat-related causes, according to an analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — more than doubling over the past five years. And that data is likely an underestimate, experts say, because extreme heat exposure isn’t always well documented.
Rachel Licker, principal climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that managing the health risks of climate change isn’t a new experience for some, but for many, it was a “wakeup call to the new realities” the world will be facing if it continues to burn more fossil fuels.
“This new report brings these realities into focus, including the sad reality that the health risks of climate change are most serious for those who are already most vulnerable,” Licker, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “It’s also maddening to look forward and see us continuing on this path when the risks are so clear, as laid out in the latest Lancet report.”
Tuesday’s analysis found that many of these heat-related deaths could have been prevented if the planet hadn’t warmed as much as it did, particularly for the elderly, babies and the most vulnerable communities.
Countries’ emissions plans put the world ‘wildly off track’ to contain global heating, UN assessment shows
“For the first time this year, we have done an analysis to see what would have happened if temperatures hadn’t changed,” Romanello said. “And what this is showing us is that if temperatures hadn’t changed from the 90s, we would have seen less than a half this increase in heat-related mortality just by demographic changes.”
The world is rapidly approaching irreversible harm, the authors warn. And the only way to prevent that from escalating is to swiftly transition the global economy to net-zero by halting the burning of fossil fuels — not increasing them.
The report comes just weeks before the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where world leaders will discuss how to protect public health amid a changing climate for the first time since the annual summit began more than two decades ago. Countries will also engage in critical negotiations on whether or not to phase out fossil fuels in the coming years.
“The expansion of oil and gas is undermining our health, our being, and our collective future,” Romanello said. “We absolutely need to call for fossil fuel phase-out. This will be quite a sticking point at this COP, and the health argument is what matters the most.”"
"No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe",https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/us/national-climate-assessment-extreme-weather-costs/index.html,"No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe
The effects of a rapidly warming climate are being felt in every corner of the US and will worsen over the next 10 years with continued fossil fuel use﻿, according to a stark new report from federal agencies.
The Fifth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report due roughly every five years, warned that even though planet-warming pollution in the US is slowly decreasing, it is not happening nearly fast enough to meet the nation’s targets, nor is it in line with the UN-sanctioned goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius – a threshold beyond which scientists warn life on Earth will struggle to cope.
This year’s assessment reflects the reality that Americans can increasingly see and feel climate impacts in their own communities, said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate scientist at Texas Tech University and contributor to the report.
“Climate change is affecting every aspect of our lives,” Hayhoe told CNN.
Some of the report’s sweeping conclusions remain painfully familiar: No part of the US is truly safe from climate disasters; slashing fossil fuel use is critical to limit the consequences, but we’re not doing it fast enough; and every fraction of a degree of warming leads to more intense impacts.
But there are some important new additions: Scientists can now say with more confidence when the climate crisis has made rainstorms, hurricanes and wildfires stronger or more frequent, long-term drought more severe and heat more deadly.
This summer alone, the Phoenix area baked through a record 31 consecutive days above 110 degrees, a shocking heatwave that was partly responsible for more than 500 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County in 2023 – its deadliest year for heat on record.
Countries’ emissions plans put the world ‘wildly off track’ to contain global heating, UN assessment shows
In July, a torrential rainstorm deluged parts of Vermont in deadly floodwaters. Then in August, Maui was devastated by a fast-moving wildfire and Florida’s Gulf Coast was slammed by its second major hurricane in two years.
President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Tuesday and is expected to unveil more than $6 billion in funding to strengthen climate resilience “by bolstering America’s electric grid, investing in water infrastructure upgrades, reducing flood risk to communities, and advancing environmental justice for all,” an administration official said.
The US needs “a transformation of the global economy on a size and scale that’s never occurred in human history” to “create a livable future for ourselves and our children,” White House senior climate adviser John Podesta told reporters.
Here are five significant takeaways from the federal government’s sweeping climate report.
It’s easier to pinpoint which disasters were made worse by climate change
The latest report contains an important advancement in what’s called “attribution science” – scientists can more definitively show how climate change is affecting extreme events, like heatwaves, droughts to hurricanes and severe rainstorms.
Heat waves in US and Europe would have been ‘virtually impossible’ without climate change, new report finds
Climate change doesn’t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent.
For instance, warmer oceans and air temperatures mean hurricanes are getting stronger faster and dumping more rainfall when they slam ashore. And hotter and drier conditions from climate change can help vegetation and trees become tinderboxes, turning wildfires into megafires that spin out of control.
“Now thanks to the field of attribution, we can make specific statements,” Hayhoe said, saying attribution can help pinpoint certain areas of a city that are now more likely to flood due to the effects of climate change. “The field of attribution has advanced significantly over the last five years, and that really helps people connect the dots.”
All regions are feeling climate change, but some more severely
There is no place immune from climate change, Biden administration officials and the report’s scientists emphasized, and this summer’s extreme weather was a deadly reminder.
Some states – including California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas – are facing more significant storms and extreme swings in precipitation.
Landlocked states won’t have to adapt to sea level rise, though some – including Appalachian states like Kentucky and West Virginia – have seen devastating flooding from rainstorms.
And states in the north are grappling with an increase in tick-borne diseases, less snow, and stronger rainstorms.
“There is no place that is not at risk, but there are some that are more or less at risk,” Hayhoe told CNN. “That is a factor of both the increasingly frequent and severe weather and climate extremes you’re exposed to, as well as how prepared (cities and states) are.”
Climate change is exacting a massive economic toll
Climate shocks on the economy are happening more frequently, the report said, evidenced by the new record this year for the number of extreme weather disasters costing at least $1 billion. And disaster experts have spent the last year warning the US is only beginning to see the economic fallout of the climate crisis.
Climate risks are hitting the housing market in the form of skyrocketing homeowners’ insurance rates. Some insurers have pulled out of high-risk states altogether.
Stronger storms wiping out certain crops or extreme heat killing livestock can send food prices soaring. And in the Southwest, the report’s researchers found that hotter temperatures in the future could lead to a 25% loss of physical work capacity for agricultural workers from July to September.
The US is cutting planet-warming pollution, but not nearly fast enough
Unlike the world’s other top polluters – China and India – planet-warming pollution in the US is declining. But it’s not happening nearly fast enough to stabilize the planet’s warming or meet the United States’ international climate commitments, the report explains.
The country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2019, driven in large part by the electricity sector moving away from coal and toward renewable energy and methane gas, the latter of which is still a fossil fuel that has a significant global warming effect.
The decline is good news for the climate crisis, but look at the fine print and the picture is mixed.
The report finds US planet-warming emissions “remain substantial” and would have to sharply decline by 6% annually on average to be in line with the international 1.5-degree goal. To put that cut into perspective, US emissions decreased by less than 1% per year between 2005 and 2019 – a tiny annual drop.
Water – too much and not enough – is a huge problem for the US
One of the report’s biggest takeaways centers on the precarious future of water in the US, and how parts of the country are facing a future with either extreme drought and water insecurity, or more flooding and sea level rise.
Water usage on the Colorado River is way down as the West begins planning for a future with less
Drought and less snowpack are huge threats to Southwest communities in particular. The report’s Southwest chapter, led by Arizona State University climate scientist Dave White, found the region was significantly drier from 1991 to 2020 than the three decades before.
White said that’s an ominous sign as the planet continues to warm, with significant threats to snowpack in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies – both of which provide crucial freshwater in the West.
White added that a lack of freshwater in the region also has significant economic and agricultural impacts, as it supports cities, farms, and Native American tribes.
“Mountains are our natural reservoirs in the region,” White told CNN. “Climate impacts on that mountain snowpack have really significant negative effects for the way our infrastructure operates. It’s just critical for us to protect those resources.”

In the latest clear evidence that the world remains wildly off track when it comes to tackling the climate crisis, the UN has found that even if countries enact all of their current climate pledges, planet-heating pollution in 2030 will still be 9% higher than it was in 2010.
This reveals a stark gap between the course nations are charting and what science says is needed to avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to decrease emissions by 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 to meet the internationally-agreed ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An increase of 9% means that target is way off.
Scientists consider 1.5 degrees a key threshold beyond which climate change impacts — including more frequent and more severe heat waves, droughts and storms — will become hard for humans and ecosystems to adapt to.
The findings are from a report published Tuesday by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which every year analyzes individual national plans to slash emissions — called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — of the 195 countries signed up to the Paris Climate Agreement.
No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe
Despite a dramatic increase in dire warnings from climate scientists, emissions are still on the rise. This year’s NDC Synthesis report does, however, offer a tiny glimmer of hope. The findings show that the upward trend in emissions is at least starting to slow, and emissions could peak and start decreasing before the end of the decade.
Projections show that emissions in 2030 will be 2% lower than they were in 2019, and 3% lower than the estimated levels for 2025, according to the report.
That’s largely because some countries have recently boosted the ambition levels of their climate plans, which has translated to a fractional improvement on last year, when the UN found countries were on track to increase emissions by 11% by 2030 compared to 2010 — and the year before that, when the figure was 14%.
But these are all very much “baby steps,” said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, in a statement.
UN Secretary General António Guterres said the report shows that “the world remains massively off track to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoiding the worst of climate catastrophe.”
“Global ambition stagnated over the past year and national climate plans are strikingly misaligned with the science,” he added in a statement. “As the reality of climate chaos pounds communities around the world — with ever fiercer floods, fires and droughts — the chasm between need and action is more menacing than ever.”
A second UN report also published Tuesday analyzed countries’ 2050 plans to reach net zero — where they decarbonize their economies as much as possible and remove any remaining planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere.
It found that if all long-term strategies were implemented on time, these countries’ emissions could be roughly 63% lower in 2050 compared to 2019. Although the report noted that many net zero targets remain uncertain and have long deadlines, postponing critical action into the future.
Tuesday’s findings follow the UN’s Global Stocktake report released in September, which also confirmed that governments are not moving fast enough to avoid catastrophic levels of warming. It warned there was “a rapidly narrowing window to raise ambition and implement existing commitments.”
Stiell said these findings should catalyze bolder action at the UN’s upcoming COP28 climate summit in Dubai. “Every fraction of a degree matters, but we are severely off track,” he said. “COP28 is our time to change that.”
At COP28, countries will complete the global stocktake exercise, where they assess progress on climate action. The process is intended to feed into the next round of more ambitious national climate action plans due to be submitted to the UN in 2025."
Drenching rain on its way to quench Louisiana’s worst drought on record,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/13/weather/gulf-coast-rain-drought-relief-climate/index.html,"Drenching rain on its way to quench Louisiana’s worst drought on record

The Gulf Coast’s most significant rainfall in months will bring much-needed relief this week to portions of the Gulf Coast, helping to alleviate Louisiana’s worst drought on record – one that’s fueled unprecedented wildfires and helped trigger an alarming saltwater intrusion into the Mississippi River.
Exceptional drought – the US Drought Monitor’s most extreme category – is entrenched across 73% of Louisiana, according to data released Thursday. It’s the largest area of exceptional drought on record in the state. Exceptional drought has also spread across nearly half of Mississippi and a portion of eastern Texas.
A significant rainfall deficit resulting from an incredibly hot and dry summer is to blame for these expansive areas of drought along the Gulf Coast, but multiple days of rain this week will help the region make up some crucial ground.
Widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected across southern Louisiana, mainly south of Interstate 10, from Monday to Wednesday. Higher amounts are possible along the coastline, where up to 5 inches could fall in some locations.
“Any kind of rainfall we can get, especially when it’s widespread like this, is very beneficial to the area,” said Doug Cramer, a warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
Showers and areas of steady rain spread across parts of the Texas and Louisiana early Monday as a slow-moving storm churns just off the coast. Rainfall will expand in scope and become steadier across Louisiana by late Monday and continue through at least Wednesday morning as the storm moves slowly over the northern Gulf of Mexico.
The rainfall is unlikely to cause significant flooding, but the stormy weather will lead to choppy seas and coastal flooding at high tide.
By Wednesday, rain will expand farther eastward to drench portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.
Whether the rainfall will make enough of a dent in Louisiana’s exceptional drought to warrant a downgrade in drought intensity remains to be seen.
“It’s possible,” Cramer told CNN, noting it is difficult to say with any certainty whether drought categories will change until a rainfall analysis begins after the event concludes.
An El Niño winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US
“It does appear as though [Louisiana] is going to continue to see rain chances over the next couple of weeks, so that’s good news,” Cramer added.
Year-to-date, parts of Louisiana have had less than half of the rainfall typically recorded at this point in the year. As of Sunday, only 27 inches of rain had fallen in New Orleans – the second-driest year-to-date the city has ever reported by early November. New Orleans typically receives close to 56 inches of rain by early November.
In the long term, Cramer pointed to El Niño as further good news for drought reduction.
“El Niño is typically wet along the Gulf Coast over the winter time, so we’re optimistic we can start to move the needle on this.”

Thousands of Greenland’s glaciers are rapidly shrinking. Before-and-after photos reveal decades of change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/12/climate/greenland-glaciers-before-after-climate/index.html,"Thousands of Greenland’s glaciers are rapidly shrinking. Before-and-after photos reveal decades of change
When Laura Larocca visited Denmark in 2019, the climate scientist sifted through thousands of old aerial photographs of Greenland’s icy coastline, which were rediscovered in a castle outside Copenhagen about 15 years ago.
Now housed in the Danish National Archives, the historical images inspired her and other researchers to reconstruct the territory’s glacial history and how it has changed amid a rapidly warming climate.
After digitizing thousands of archived paper images dating back to the 1930s, Larocca’s team combined them with satellite images of Greenland today to measure how much its frozen landscape has changed.
The comparison found Greenland’s glaciers have experienced an alarming rate of retreat that has accelerated over the last two decades. The study, published this week in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the rate of glacial retreat during the 21st century has been twice as fast as the retreat in the 20th century.
The work was “very time consuming, and it took a lot of people, a lot of hours of manual labor,” said Larocca, the lead author of the study who was a postdoctorate at Northwestern University at the time of the research. “The change is stunning — it really highlights the fast pace at which the Arctic is warming and changing.”
Over the past several decades, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, a 2022 study showed. The fallout of that warming is mounting. For the first time on record, it rained at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level during the summer of 2021. Earlier this week, scientists found that northern Greenland’s huge glaciers, which were long thought to be relatively stable, now pose potentially “dramatic” consequences for sea level rise.
What struck Larocca the most was how the Danish pilots who took the original photos had no idea they would be a major contribution to climate science nearly a century later.
“It is quite interesting that a lot of these photos were taken because of military operations,” she said. “So, they have ties with a lot of international and US history, as well. But it’s kind of neat how over 100 years later, we’re using these photos for science to document how much these glaciers have changed over time.”
Larocca, now an assistant professor at Arizona State University School of Ocean Futures, said she hopes this new visual-heavy study will draw attention to the rapidly melting territory and the threat it poses to the world’s coastlines as sea level rises.
“[The paper] really reinforces that our choices over the next few decades and how much we reduce our emissions really matter to these glaciers,” Larocca said. “Every incremental increase in temperature will have significant consequences for these glaciers, and that swift action to limit global temperature rise will really help to reduce their future loss and contribution to sea level.”"
First atmospheric river storm of the season targets California next week,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/11/weather/california-weather-atmospheric-river-west-climate/index.html,"First atmospheric river storm of the season targets California next week
Follow:
A major pattern change is set to deliver California’s first atmospheric river of the season next week. Significant rain and snow is in the forecast for the Golden State, while damp, dreary days are ahead for other parts of the West as signs of El Niño’s influence on the upcoming winter season emerge.
November got off to a wet start across the Pacific Northwest, but the rainy weather didn’t make it south into much of California. Two things will bring a dramatic change to that trend next week: a southward dip in the jet stream – the river of fast-moving air that carries storms around the planet – will be pointed directly at California; and a large area of disruptive atmospheric energy will linger just off the West Coast.
Next week’s storms will be fueled in part by an atmospheric river – the region’s hallmark type of winter storm, which transports abundant moisture from the tropical Pacific straight to the West Coast.
The West was drenched by many of these systems last winter: California alone saw at least a dozen significant atmospheric rivers, which claimed at least 18 lives and dealt tremendous damage to infrastructure. But they also brought much-needed rain and snow to a region that desperately needed it, filling reservoirs and allowing water officials to take stock and prepare for a future with less freshwater.
Atmospheric rivers are categorized on a five-point scale, with 1 describing “weak” storms and 5 classified as “exceptional.” Next week’s event is shaping up to be at least a Level 2 of 5 – in other words, a “moderate” atmospheric river.
Rain will push into Northern California as early as Monday, spreading to parts of Central California on Tuesday. The timing for rain in Southern California depends strongly on the exact evolution of the storm early next week, but wet weather will likely commence by late Wednesday or Thursday.
Once rain begins, it will continue at varying intensity for much of the week and into the weekend for some areas. Rainfall amounts are not expected to reach catastrophic levels that would trigger widespread flooding, but many locations could receive more than a month’s worth in a matter of days.
Any rain that falls will be notable – California hasn’t experienced multiple days of rain since the summer, and many locations are in a rainfall deficit compared to average.
New maps reveal who could see more snow this winter during a strong El Niño
From September 1 to November 9, San Francisco and Los Angeles have each only recorded about 6% of the average rainfall for the period. Despite this rainfall deficit, California is drought-free for the first time in nearly four years: the state reported no areas of drought in mid-October, which was the first such reading since January 2020.
Rain isn’t the only concern next week – the stormy setup is primed to deliver significant snow to the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
Multiple feet of snow could fall in the highest elevations of the Sierra, with up to a foot in some foothills by next weekend. The elevation where rain will change to snow will start out quite high next week, but snow will likely begin to pile up in the lower elevations of the mountains in earnest late-week as colder air is pulled across the region.
Elsewhere across the West, there will be no discernible break from the dreariness with the new influx of wet weather next week, and the Northwest will remain wet both this weekend and next week as moisture continues to funnel across the region.
El Niño and atmospheric rivers are linked
Like many other elements of the upcoming winter – including temperature and snow – studies have shown that El Niño influences the behavior of atmospheric rivers.
A 2017 study found atmospheric rivers are more likely to impact the western US during El Niño, when ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific are abnormally high.
Not only can El Niño affect where atmospheric rivers dump the most precipitation, its strength can also affect how often they occur. A study published in January found the frequency of atmospheric rivers increased during strong El Niño years – the level expected this winter.
Like any weather phenomenon, atmospheric rivers aren’t dependent on just one variable. So, having a strong El Niño in place doesn’t necessarily guarantee a higher frequency of atmospheric river events.
For example, the 2017 study also found that atmospheric rivers are less likely to impact the western US during La Niña. But La Niña was firmly in place last winter when California was slammed by a dozen of the potent storms."

Month after month since June, the world has been abnormally hot. Scientists have compared this year’s climate-change fallout to “a disaster movie” — soaring temperatures, fierce wildfires, powerful storms and devastating floods — and new data is now revealing just how exceptional the global heat has been.
Two major reports published this week paint an alarming picture of this unprecedented heat: Humanity has just lived through the hottest 12-month period in at least 125,000 years, according to one, while the other declared that 2023 is “virtually certain” to be the hottest year in recorded history, after five consecutive months of record-obliterating temperatures.
“We have become all too used to climate records falling like dominoes in recent years,” David Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute at the University of Edinburgh, told CNN. “But 2023 is a whole different ball game in terms of the massive margin by which these records have been broken.”
The period from November 2022 to the end of October 2023 was the hottest 12 months, with an average temperature of 1.32 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to an analysis of international data, published Thursday by the nonprofit research group Climate Central.
Scientist calls record global heat in September ‘gobsmackingly bananas’
El Niño — a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific — is just beginning to boost temperatures, the report found. The strong, long-term trend of global warming is primarily driven by the burning of planet-heating fossil fuels.
“The key is this is not normal. These are temperatures we should not be experiencing,” Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central, said on a call with reporters. “We are only experiencing them because we have put too much carbon dioxide onto the atmosphere.”
The vast majority of humanity was affected by unusual heat over this 12-month period, researchers found, with 7.3 billion people — 90% of the global population — experiencing at least 10 days of high temperatures “with very strong climate fingerprints.”
In India, 1.2 billion people — 86% of the population — experienced at least 30 days of high temperatures, made at least three times more likely by climate change. In the United States, that figure was 88 million people, or 26% of the population.
Some cities were particularly hard hit. In the US, these were concentrated in the South and Southwest. Houston experienced the longest extreme heat streak of any major city on Earth, according to the report, with 22 consecutive days of extreme heat between July and August.
Only two countries, Iceland and Lesotho, experienced temperatures that were cooler-than-average over this period, the report found.
Climate Central’s findings come on the heels of another analysis, published Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which said that 2023 is “virtually certain” to be the hottest year on record.
The prediction follows the report’s finding that last month was the hottest October on record by a significant margin, beating the previous record set in 2019 by 0.4 degrees Celsius. The month was 1.7 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average.
“October 2023 has seen exceptional temperature anomalies, following on from four months of global temperature records being obliterated,” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said in a statement.
Every month since June has smashed monthly heat records and every month since July has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The year to-date is averaging 1.43 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus — perilously close to the internationally agreed ambition to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
While scientists are most concerned about long-term temperature trends, the past several months above that threshold have been an alarming taste of what the world can expect as global warming accelerates.
The planet saw its hottest day on record this week. It’s a record that will be broken again and again
“The likely impacts of this extra heat are well understood,” Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK, told CNN. “We are already seeing its impact in more violent storms, heavier rains and floods, and more intense, frequent and longer heatwaves, droughts and wildfires.”
In addition to unprecedented land temperatures, ocean temperatures continued to soar. They have consistently been at record-high levels since the beginning of May, according to Copernicus, fueling an explosive development of hurricanes and tropical storms around the planet, including Hurricane Otis, which slammed into Southern Mexico last month.
Antarctic sea ice also remained at record-lows for the sixth consecutive month, according to the report.
“Laid out so starkly, the 2023 numbers on air temperatures, sea temperatures, sea ice and the rest look like something out of a disaster movie,” Reay said.
While the statistics in these reports are big and alarming, it’s what’s behind them that’s truly terrifying, said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London. “The fact that we’re seeing this record hot year means record human suffering,” she said in a statement.
Even as 2023 draws to a close, the extraordinary heat shows little sign of letting up.
The world is planning to blow the fossil fuels production limit that would keep a lid on global heating, report says
China saw more than 12 monthly temperature records broken on Monday, with temperatures reaching 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) in some places. While in the US, multiple heat records have fallen this week, with parts of Texas reaching 93 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday, beating previous November records.
And records are predicted to continue to be broken next year. “El Niño is really going to bite next year and that’s going to lead to even more warming as we head into 2024,” Pershing said.
The unprecedented global heat adds extra urgency to the upcoming UN COP28 climate conference in Dubai this December, where countries will take stock of their progress towards meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.
Scientists are clear that this means stopping burning oil, gas and coal. But a report published by the UN on Wednesday found that governments are planning to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels than the limit that would cap global heating at 1.5C degrees.
“The only thing more remarkable than the magnitude of these increases in global temperature and sea ice loss,” Reay said, “is our continuing failure to put the world on track to meet the Paris climate goals.”

Global fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than double the levels that are deemed consistent with meeting climate goals set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the United Nations and researchers said on Wednesday.
The United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) report, assessing the gap in fossil fuel production cuts and what’s needed to meet climate goals, comes ahead of the global COP 28 climate meeting, which starts on November 30 in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.
“Fossil fuel phase out is one of the pivotal issues that will be negotiated at COP 28,” Ploy Achakulwisut, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) scientist and a lead author of the report said in a press briefing.
“We need countries to commit to a phase out of all fossil fuels to keep the 1.5C goal alive,” she said.
Under the Paris pact, nations have committed to a long-term goal of limiting average temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to attempt to limit them even further to 1.5C.
While scientists say fossil fuel use must be reduced to meet the goal, countries have failed to reach any international agreement set phaseout dates for unabated coal, gas or oil use.
The report analysed the 20 major fossil fuel producers and found they plan to produce, in total, around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting the degree of warming to 1.5C, and 69% more than is consistent with 2C.
None of the 20 countries have committed to reduce coal, oil, and gas production in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C the report said.
It said 17 of the countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions but most continue to promote, subsidise, support and plan the expansion of fossil fuel production.
The 20 countries analysed account for 82% of global fossil fuel production and 73% of consumption, the report said and include Australia, China, Norway, Qatar, Britain, the UAE and the United States.
The report was produced by UNEP, as well as experts from the SEI, the International Institute for Sustainable Development and think-tank E3G and policy institute Climate Analytics."

Blazing fires, biblical floods and catastrophic storms are becoming increasingly common but they could be just a taste of things to come. Scientists say our planet is teetering towards a number of climate “tipping points” which could cause irreversible changes to the place we all call home.
From the Antarctic ice sheet to the Amazon rainforest, the consequences of climate change can be seen right now – but it’s not the only threat to the natural world. In a series of graphics, we take a look at some of the biggest environmental challenges facing our planet.
Dwindling biodiversity
Human activities including logging, pollution, overfishing and urban development are driving a staggering loss of biodiversity. Global wildlife populations plummeted by 69% on average between 1970 and 2018, according to WWF’s Living Planet Report 2022.
It notes that land-use change – which includes clearing land for agriculture or urban development – is the biggest current threat to nature, but adds that climate change is “likely to become the dominant cause of biodiversity loss in the coming decades.”
The UN’s landmark 2019 biodiversity report said that one million of all the planet’s eight million species are threatened with extinction. It reported that the global rate of extinction “is already tens to hundreds of times higher than it has been, on average, over the last 10 million years.”
Our fading forests
Trees soak up planet-heating carbon dioxide and forests can lock away carbon for centuries, but they’re disappearing at an alarming rate due to a combination of human activities.
Southeast Asia’s peat swamp forests are home to varied wildlife and hold large below-ground carbon stocks but many of these forests have been drained and degraded to make room for farmland. Drained peatland can dry up and turn into a tinderbox, and if it catches fire, it can release up to 10 times more carbon than forest fires.
Elsewhere, researchers have found that some tropical forests – including the southeastern part of the Amazon rainforest – are shifting from a carbon sink to a carbon source, adding more carbon into the atmosphere.
Problem plastic
It can take anywhere from 20 to 500 years for plastics to decompose and they can be found pretty much anywhere, from city streets to Antarctic sea ice and even drinking water. Not even the planet’s tallest peak or the world’s deepest ocean trench can escape plastic pollution.
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a 620,000-square-mile swirl of trash, floats on the ocean surface between California and Hawaii, threatening aquatic life with entanglement and chemical contamination.
Plastics pose a significant threat to wildlife from seals to seabirds, and have been found in the guts of many aquatic organisms, including every marine turtle species. Microplastics, plastics that have been broken down into tiny pieces, can be found in our drinking water systems and even floating in the air.
Pollinators on the brink
Pollinators include bumblebees, wasps, moths and butterflies, as well as birds and small mammals, like bats. But many are facing threats from pesticides and crop monocultures, as well as the destruction of their habitats.
A 2023 study from the University of Sheffield found that night-time moths account for a third of pollinator visits to crops, flowers and trees in all urban areas, but their global abundance has declined by 33% in the last 50 years.
If pollinators continue to decline in numbers, this could have serious repercussions for food production. One study estimated that the loss of pollinators globally is causing a decline in the supply of healthy foods that’s resulting in about 430,000 early deaths a year.
Bird populations under threat
Global bird populations face pressure from habitat destruction due to agriculture, development and logging, while seabirds are being impacted by overfishing.
In 50 years, nearly 3 billion birds have disappeared from North America’s skies and the UK has 73 million fewer birds than it had in 1970, according to research from the British Trust for Ornithology.
In Hawaii, 33 bird species have gone extinct since 1825 due to habitat loss and the introduction of mammals and disease, while in India, 178 species of wild bird are of high conservation priority.
Despite the scale of the challenges, there are countless groups and individuals committed to protecting our planet. For Call to Earth Day 2023, we’re celebrating the initiatives that strive to protect nature and our connected ecosystems across the world. Find out how you can get involved."
World Bank to host climate damages fund despite opposition from developing nations,https://www.cnn.com/world-bank-loss-damage-climate-cop28-intl/index.html,"World Bank to host climate damages fund despite opposition from developing nations
Follow:
Countries have moved a step closer to getting a fund off the ground to help poor states damaged by climate disasters, despite reservations from developing nations and the United States.
The deal to create a “loss and damage” fund was hailed as a breakthrough for developing country negotiators at United Nations climate talks in Egypt last year, overcoming years of resistance from wealthy nations.
But in the past 11 months, governments have struggled to reach consensus on the details of the fund, such as who will pay and where the fund will be located.
A special UN committee tasked with implementing the fund met for a fifth time in Abu Dhabi this week — following a deadlock in Egypt last month — to finalize recommendations that will be put to governments when they meet for the annual climate summit COP28 in Dubai in less than four weeks’ time. The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024.
The committee, representing a geographically diverse group of countries, on Saturday resolved to recommend the World Bank serve as trustee and host of the fund — a tension point that has fueled divisions between developed and developing nations.
Housing a fund at the World Bank, whose presidents are appointed by the US, would give donor countries outsized influence over the fund and result in high fees for recipient countries, developing countries have argued.
To get all countries on board, it was agreed the World Bank would serve as interim trustee and host of the fund for a four-year period.
Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s special climate envoy, said in a post on X that Berlin “stands ready to fulfill its responsibility — we’re actively working towards contributing to the new fund and assessing options for more structural sources of financing.”
Others were less optimistic.
“It is a somber day for climate justice, as rich countries turn their backs on vulnerable communities,” said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International.
“Rich countries … have not only coerced developing nations into accepting the World Bank as the host of the Loss and Damage Fund but have also evaded their duty to lead in providing financial assistance to those communities and countries.”
The committee also recommended that developed countries be urged to continue to provide support to the fund, but failed to resolve whether wealthy nations would be under strict financial obligation to chip in.
“We regret that the text does not reflect consensus concerning the need for clarity on the voluntary nature of contributions,” a US State Department official told Reuters.
The US attempted to include a footnote clarifying that any contributions to the fund would be voluntary, but the committee chair did not allow it. The US objected to that denial.
Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, who will preside over the COP28 talks, said he welcomed the committee’s recommendations and that they would pave the way for an agreement at COP28."

Follow:
The planet is on track to heat up at a much faster rate than scientists have previously predicted, meaning a key global warming threshold could be breached this decade, according to a new study co-authored by James Hansen — the US scientist widely credited with being the first to publicly sound the alarm on the climate crisis in the 1980s.
In the paper, published Thursday in the journal Oxford Open Climate Change, Hansen and more than a dozen other scientists used a combination of paleoclimate data, including data from polar ice cores and tree rings, climate models and observational data, to conclude that the Earth is much more sensitive to climate change than previously understood.
“We are in the early phase of a climate emergency,” according to the report, which warns a surge of heat “already in the pipeline” will rapidly push global temperatures beyond what has been predicted, resulting in warming that exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in the 2020s, and above 2 degrees Celsius before 2050.
The findings add to a slew of recent research that concludes the world is hurtling toward 1.5 degrees, a threshold beyond which the impacts of climate change — including extreme heat, drought and floods — will become significantly harder for humans to adapt to.
Energy company pulls the plug on two major offshore wind projects on East Coast
“The 1.5-degree limit is deader than a doornail,” said Hansen on a call with reporters. “And the 2-degree limit can be rescued, only with the help of purposeful actions.”
Some other scientists, however, have cast doubt on the paper’s conclusions that climate change is accelerating faster than models predict.
Hansen, a director at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is a renowned climate scientist whose 1988 testimony to the US Senate first brought global attention to climate change.
He has previously warned that the Earth has an energy imbalance, as more energy comes in through sunlight than leaves through heat radiating into space.
The resulting excess heat is equivalent to 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs a day, with most of the energy absorbed by the ocean, Hansen’s research found a decade ago.
In this recent paper, Hansen and his co-authors say the energy imbalance has now increased, in part because of successful efforts to tackle particle air pollution, especially in China and through global restrictions on shipping pollution. While this kind of pollution is a serious health hazard, it also has a cooling effect, as particles reflect sunlight away from the Earth.
The imbalance is set to cause accelerated global warming, bringing disastrous consequences, according to the paper, including rapid sea level rise and the potential shutdown of vital ocean currents within this century.
Hansen said he is particularly concerned about the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and especially the Thwaites Glacier, which acts as a cork, holding back the ice on land and providing an important defense against catastrophic sea level rise.
But the warming is not necessarily locked in, according to the paper, which calls for “extraordinary actions.”
World isn’t spending nearly enough money to prepare the most vulnerable countries for climate extremes, UN reports
Measures it recommends include taxing carbon pollution, increasing nuclear power to “complement renewable energies” and strong action from developed countries to help developing countries move to low carbon energy. While the highest priority is to drastically reduce planet-heating pollution, this alone will not be enough, the report found.
“If we’re going to keep sea level close to where it is, we actually have to cool the planet,” said Hansen.
One way to do this, the report suggests, is solar geoengineering. This controversial technology aims to cool temperatures by reflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or allowing more heat to escape into space. That can be done through injecting aerosols into the atmosphere or spraying clouds with salt particles to make them more reflective, for example.
Critics warn of unforeseen consequences, including impacts on rainfall and monsoons, as well as “termination shock” if geoengineering were suddenly halted and pent-up warming released.
But Hansen said it should be considered. “Rather than describe those efforts as ‘threatening geoengineering,’ we have to recognize that we are geoengineering the planet right now,” he said, by burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels.
The paper’s findings are alarming and come as the world is experiencing unprecedented heat. This year is on course to be the hottest on record, with every month from June onwards breaking records for the hottest such month.
But while science is clear that the rate of global warming is increasing, the idea that it is accelerating beyond what models predict is controversial.
The findings “are very much out of the mainstream,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.

While the Earth’s surface and its oceans are warming, the data does not support claims that the rate is accelerating, he told CNN in an email. “As I like to say, the truth is bad enough!” Mann said. “There is no evidence that the models are under-predicting human-caused warming.”
He also cast doubt on the role of pollution reduction in warming trends, saying the total impact is very small, and warned that solar geoengineering is “unprecedented” and “potentially very dangerous.”
“Whether or not the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is reachable is a matter of policy, not climate physics, at this point,” Mann said.
But Hansen rejected criticisms of the research, saying it’s based on hard numbers and straightforward physics.
“This is not fringe, this is the correct physics and it is the real world,” he said, “and it sometimes takes the community a while to catch on.”"

Measures to adapt to climate change in the developing world are slowing on all fronts even as the impacts of the crisis are accelerating, creating a widening gap that leaves billions of people increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat, worsening storms and sea level rise, a UN report published Thursday shows.
The estimated costs to fully prepare low-income nations for the worst effects of a rapidly heating planet are now 10 to 18 times greater than the amount of money that is currently flowing to these regions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s annual “adaptation gap” report. That’s a more than 50% larger gap than UNEP had estimated in its 2022 report.
The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to help both with their green transitions and efforts to adapt to the climate crisis. That pledge was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, but the target has never been met.
Poorer nations have also complained that too little of the $100 billion is devoted to so-called adaptation — preparing for the worsening harms of the climate crisis, including deadly heat, flooding, storms, wildfires and rising oceans.

The flow of adaptation finance declined by 15% to $21 billion in 2021 – the most recent year UNEP has data for – though its authors noted the Covid pandemic may have deflated climate finance spending that year. UNEP estimates the actual need is between $194 billion and $366 billion a year, and is projected to rise dramatically by 2050 as the planet warms.
“The urgency is becoming very clear,” Andrea Hinwood, UNEP’s chief scientist, told CNN. “The advice we have is that in the next eight years, we need to be working as hard and fast as we can to do as much as we can to prepare us for the out-years, where some of the challenges we’re facing are going to be harder.”
Unless the gap between what’s needed and what’s provided is closed, the world will more rapidly reach the threshold where people can no longer adapt to their changing climate, according to the report.
The issue — as well as who should pay for the loss and damage created by the climate crisis — is expected to be a key sticking point in climate negotiations at the COP28 talks in Dubai this December.
“In the next talks, there has to be a discussion about some new goals for adaptation,” Hinwood said, “but also perhaps a renewed commitment in terms of the funding and the finance that should be flowing to adaptation in developing countries.”

Developed nations bear a greater historical responsibility for the human-induced climate crisis, but developing nations and small-island states are suffering the worst impacts.
A recent study showed that 55 of the world’s most vulnerable economies have already experienced losses and damages of more than $500 billion in the last two decades from the climate crisis.
“If we don’t fund adaptation, we then get ourselves into a situation where we can no longer adapt,” Hinwood said. “Developed countries who are still emitting greenhouse gases per capita levels that are massively more than developing countries need to show leadership here. Whatever efforts we put in place now will pay back down the track.”
The report shows that the world can still prevent the mounting economic toll climate disasters could bring. Every billion dollars invested in infrastructure to protect people from coastal flooding could save $14 billion in economic damages, according to the report. And for every $16 billion invested in agriculture each year, 78 million people could be alleviated from climate crisis related starvation or chronic hunger."

Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.
King Charles III will attend the UN’s COP28 climate summit in Dubai this year and deliver an address at the opening ceremony, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday.
Last year, the UK government, led by then-Prime Minister Liz Truss, advised the British monarch against attending the 2022 annual talks, which were held in Egypt. CNN understood at the time that, following consultations with the government, it was jointly agreed that the climate summit wasn’t the right occasion for the King’s first trip overseas as sovereign.
Few world leaders have confirmed their attendance at the talks. It is not yet clear whether US President Joe Biden will travel to the United Arab Emirates for the event.
The 74-year-old King will give his address on December 1, and also meet with regional leaders, the palace said. His visit comes at a time of high tensions in the Middle East, as the Israel-Gaza war threatens to spill over to other countries.
“The King will attend the Opening Ceremony of the World Climate Action Summit at COP28 UAE, at the invitation of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and at the request of His Majesty’s Government, on Friday 1st December 2023,” the statement from the palace added.
During his visit to the UAE, Charles will also attend a reception to launch the inaugural COP28 Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum — a two-day event running alongside the UN summit. It will be hosted by the COP28 presidency in strategic partnership with Charles’ Sustainable Markets Initiative, which he set up while still Prince of Wales.
The high-level forum aims to bring together world leaders and figures from the worlds of business, finance and philanthropy to drive forward climate and nature solutions and results.
King Charles III has been a passionate advocate of environmental and climate causes for at least five decades. He attended the COP26 climate talks as Prince of Wales in 2021, which was held in Glasgow, Scotland, where he urged countries to work with industry to create climate crisis solutions.

He gave a speech there in which he said the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat climate change and biodiversity loss.
Last year, after confirming he would not attend COP27, the King instead convened business leaders, experts and NGOs for a pre-COP reception at Buckingham Palace in London. He ultimately traveled to Germany and France for his first state visits as monarch.
He was also a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the importance of the agreement with President Donald Trump in December 2019, as the US leader prepared to pull his country from the pact."
They went hunting for fossil fuels. What they found could help save the world,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/29/climate/white-hydrogen-fossil-fuels-climate/index.html,"They went hunting for fossil fuels. What they found could help save the world
Follow:
When tw﻿o scientists went looking for fossil fuels beneath the ground of northeastern France, they did not expect to discover something which could supercharge the effort to tackle the climate crisis.
Jacques Pironon and Phillipe De Donato, both directors of research at France’s National Centre of Scientific Research, were assessing the amount of methane in the subsoils of the Lorraine mining basin using a “world first” specialized probe, able to analyze gases dissolved in the water of rock formations deep underground.
A couple of hundred meters down, the probe found low concentrations of hydrogen. “This was not a real surprise for us,” Pironon told CNN; it’s common to find small amounts near the surface of a borehole. But as the probe went deeper, the concentration ticked up. At 1,100 meters down it was 14%, at 1,250 meters it was 20%.
This was surprising, Pironon said. It indicated the presence of a large reservoir of hydrogen beneath. They ran calculations and estimated the deposit could contain between 6 million and 250 million metric tons﻿ of hydrogen.
That could make it one of the largest deposits of “white hydrogen” ever discovered, Pironon said. The find has helped fuel an already feverish interest in the gas.
White hydrogen – also referred to as “natural,” “gold” or “geologic” hydrogen – is naturally produced or present in the Earth’s crust and has become something of a climate holy grail.
Biden announces regional hydrogen hubs in hopes of sparking a clean-energy revolution
Hydrogen produces only water when burned, making it very attractive as a potential clean energy source for industries like aviation, shipping and steel-making that need so much energy it’s almost impossible to meet through renewables such as solar and wind.
But while hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it generally exists combined with other molecules. Currently, commercial hydrogen is produced in an energy-intensive process almost entirely powered by fossil fuels.
A rainbow of colors is used as a shorthand for the different types of hydrogen. “Gray” is made from methane gas and “brown” from coal. “Blue” hydrogen is the same as gray, but the planet-heating pollution produced is captured before it goes into the atmosphere.
The most promising from a climate perspective is “green” hydrogen, made using renewable energy to split water. Yet production remains small scale and expensive.
That’s why interest in white hydrogen, a potentially abundant, untapped source of clean-burning energy, has ratcheted up over the last few years.
‘We haven’t been looking in the right places’
“If you had asked me four years ago what I thought about natural hydrogen, I would have told you ‘oh, it doesn’t exist,’” said Geoffrey Ellis, a geochemist with the US Geological Survey. “Hydrogen’s out there, we know it’s around,” he said, but scientists thought big accumulations weren’t possible.
Then he found out about Mali. Arguably, the catalyst for the current interest in white hydrogen can be traced to this West African country.
In 1987, in the village of Bourakébougou, a driller was left with burns after a water well unexpectedly exploded as he leaned over the edge of it while smoking a cigarette.
The well was swiftly plugged and abandoned until 2011, when it was unplugged by an oil and gas company and reportedly found to be producing a gas that was 98% hydrogen. The hydrogen was used to power the village, and more than a decade later, it is still producing.
When a study came out about the well in 2018, it caught the attention of the science community, including Ellis. His initial reaction was that there had to be something wrong with the research, “because we just know that this can’t happen.”
Then the pandemic hit and he had time on his hands to start digging. The more he read, the more he realized “we just haven’t been looking for it, we haven’t been looking in the right places.”
The recent discoveries are exciting for Ellis, who has been working as a petroleum geochemist since the 1980s. He witnessed the rapid growth of the shale gas industry in the US, which revolutionized the energy market. “Now,” he said, “here we are in what I think is probably a second revolution.”
White hydrogen is “very promising,” agreed Isabelle Moretti, a scientific researcher at the University of Pau et des Pays de l’Adour and the University of Sorbonne and a white hydrogen expert.
“Now the question is no longer about the resource… but where to find large economic reserves,” she told CNN.
A slew of startups
Dozens of processes generate white hydrogen but there is still some uncertainty about how large natural deposits form.
Geologists have tended to focus on “serpentinization,” where water reacts with iron-rich rocks to produce hydrogen, and “radiolysis,” a radiation-driven breakdown of water molecules.
White hydrogen deposits have been found throughout the world, including in the US, eastern Europe, Russia, Australia, Oman, as well as France and Mali.
‘Not nearly enough.’ IEA says fossil fuel demand will peak soon but urges faster action
Some have been discovered by accident, others by hunting for clues like features in the landscapes sometimes referred to as “fairy circles” – shallow, elliptical depressions that can leak hydrogen.
Ellis estimates globally there could be tens of billions of tons of white hydrogen. This would be vastly more than the 100 million tons a year of hydrogen that is currently produced and the 500 million tons predicted to be produced annually by 2050, he said.
“Most of this is almost certainly going to be in very small accumulations or very far offshore, or just too deep to actually be economic to produce,” he said. But if just 1% can be found and produced, it would provide 500 million tons of hydrogen for 200 years, he added.
It’s a tantalizing prospect for a slew of startups.
Australia-based Gold Hydrogen is currently drilling in the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. It targeted that spot after scouring the state’s archives and discovering that back in the 1920s, a number of boreholes had been drilled there which had very high concentrations of hydrogen. The prospectors, only interested in fossil fuels, abandoned them.
“We’re very excited by what we’re seeing,” said managing director Neil McDonald. There is more testing and drilling to do but the company could get into early production possibly in late 2024, he told CNN.
Some startups are seeing eye-popping investments. Koloma, a Denver-based white hydrogen start-up, has secured $91 million from investors, including the Bill Gates-founded investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures – although the company remains tight-lipped about exactly where in the US it is drilling and when it is aiming for commercialization.
Another Denver-based company, Natural Hydrogen Energy, founded by geochemist Viacheslav Zgonnik, has completed an exploratory hydrogen borehole in Nebraska in 2019 and has plans for new wells. The world is “very close to the first commercial projects,” Zgonnik told CNN.
“Natural hydrogen is a solution which will allow us to get get to speed” on climate action, he said.
From hype to reality
The challenge for these businesses and for scientists will be translating hypothetical promise into a commercial reality.
“There could be a period of decades where there’s a lot of trial and error and false starts,” Ellis said. But speed is vital. “If it’s going to take us 200 years to develop the resource, that’s not really going to be of much use.”
But many of the startups are bullish. Some predict years, not decades, to commercialization. “We have all necessary technology we need, with some slight modifications,” Zgonnik said.
Challenges remain. In some countries, regulations are an obstacle. Costs also need to be worked out. According to calculations based on the Mali well, white hydrogen could cost around $1 a kilogram to produce – compared to around $6 a kilogram for green hydrogen. But white hydrogen could quickly become more expensive if large deposits require deeper drilling.
Back in the Lorraine basin, Pironon and De Donato’s next steps are to drill down to 3,000 meters to get a clearer idea of exactly how much white hydrogen there is.
There’s a long way to go, but it would be ironic if this region – once one of western Europe’s key coal producers – became an epicenter of a new white hydrogen industry."

Glaciers in East Antarctica could lose ice faster in the future than previously thought, scientists reported Friday, in an alarming feedback loop where glacier meltwater is triggering even more ice loss and sea level rise as the planet warms.
The findings come less than a week after scientists reported rapid melting of West Antarctica’s ice shelves may now be unavoidable, thanks to human-caused global warming. Together, these and other recent studies paint a dire picture of a melting southern continent that poses extreme risk of life-altering sea level rise around the world.
“This paper shows that it’s not only bad, but it’s even worse than we thought,” said Jamin Greenbaum, co-author of the study and assistant research geophysicist at the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, focused on the Denman and Scott glaciers in East Antarctica that together hold enough ice to trigger roughly five feet of sea level rise.
Rapid melting in West Antarctica is ‘unavoidable,’ with potentially disastrous consequences for sea level rise, study finds
Previous studies have shown that as glaciers melt, the water flows underneath them and out to sea – a process that enhances glacial melting and ice loss. Friday’s study factored that feedback into simulations to see how much it could accelerate Antarctic melting and sea level rise.
Scientists found the glaciers could retreat past a critical threshold about 25 years earlier than they would have without the meltwater discharge, if the world burns planet-warming fossil fuel at an accelerated rate.
Adding the meltwater feedback increased the sea level rise from the Denman and Scott glaciers by nearly 16% by the end of 2300 under this scenario of high levels of planet-heating pollution.
Importantly, Greenbaum said, the extra ice loss from meltwater discharge is currently excluded from climate models projecting sea level rise, despite the fact that it could be a major driver of ice loss across the whole continent. Measuring this phenomenon and accounting for it in climate models is necessary “to get a realistic picture of global sea level rise,” Greenbaum said.
Tyler Pelle, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at Scripps, said people need to pay attention to this part of the world as East Antarctica becomes more unstable, posing a higher risk of sea level rise for coastal communities and low-lying island nations.
“These are huge ice masses that we previously thought were stable, and now we have all of this evidence from coastal observations showing that these glaciers have been in patterns of retreat for quite a long time now,” Pelle told CNN. “That makes it very worth the attention.”
People’s lives are at stake, researchers say.
While people alive today may not experience the devastating impacts from this melting, Pelle said the actions taken today seal the fate of future generations.
“What we emit now is going to be impacting climate for generations to come,” Pelle said. “What we do today does have an impact on what the Earth is going to look like in 2100 or 2300, even if we’re not on this Earth anymore.”
Scientists discover an ancient landscape in an area on Earth ‘less well known than the surface of Mars’
Jan De Rydt, associate professor of polar glaciology and oceanography at Northumbria University, who was not involved with the study, said the researchers make “a strong argument” for why subglacial discharge needs to be accounted for in all simulations of Antarctic ice loss.
“Given this evidence, subglacial melt and discharge is a process that can no longer be ignored in future projections of Antarctica’s contribution to sea level rise,” De Rydt told CNN.
While the researchers only used a present-day simulation for the study, which led to conservative results, Greenbaum said they plan to go back on the field to analyze the depths of the ice sheet and the ocean to truly understand what the future holds.
“The least-explored part of Antarctica is the most important to observing and monitoring,” he said. “That’s a huge problem, that’s like yell it from rooftops, and it’s something that our group is really focused on.”"

Follow:
The rapid intensification Hurricane Otis underwent in the hours before it slammed into southern Mexico is a symptom of the human-caused climate crisis, scientists say – and one that is becoming more frequent. When it happens right before landfall, as it did with Otis, it can catch coastal communities by surprise with little time to prepare.
The hurricane’s intensification was among the fastest forecasters have ever seen: its top-end windspeed increased by 115 mph in 24 hours. Only one other storm, Hurricane Patricia in 2015, exceeded Otis’ rapid intensification in East Pacific records, with a 120-mph increase in 24 hours.
The term rapid intensification refers to when a storm’s winds strengthen rapidly over a short amount of time. Scientists have defined it as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, and it generally requires significant ocean heat. The National Hurricane Center said Otis strengthened so fast on Tuesday that it had “explosively intensified.”
Otis “took full advantage of a warm patch of ocean” that was roughly 88 degrees Fahrenheit, said Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami – more than enough ocean heat to fuel a monster storm.
Hurricane Otis’ Category 5 ‘nightmare scenario’ strike knocks out all communications in Acapulco, Mexico
More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, an El Niño is growing in the Pacific this year, driving ocean temperatures even higher.
Otis’ strengthening “was extremely unusual,” McNoldy told CNN. “It’s unfortunate it happened right before making landfall, but if this had occurred over the open ocean, it still would have been very remarkable.”
Tropical storms usually take several days to grow into powerful hurricanes, but with human-caused climate change, rapid intensification is becoming a more common occurrence, said Suzana Camargo, hurricane expert and professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“It’s very rare for intense storms to make landfall in Mexico’s eastern Pacific side,” Camargo told CNN.
Only one hurricane, Category 1 Hurricane Max in 2017, has made landfall within 50 miles of Acapulco, according to a CNN analysis of NOAA data.
“But we have an El Niño year, which makes the eastern north Pacific Ocean more active than normal, and on top of that you have anthropogenic climate change,” Camargo said.
The alarming rapid intensification trend has also been reported in the Atlantic.
Rapid melting in West Antarctica is ‘unavoidable,’ with potentially disastrous consequences for sea level rise, study finds
A recent study found that Atlantic hurricanes may now be more than twice as likely to strengthen from a weak Category 1 storm to a major Category 3 in a 24-hour period than they were between 1970 and 1990.
A 2019 study found that between the 1980s and early 200s, Atlantic hurricanes showed a “highly unusual” increase in rapid intensification – a trend the report said could only be explained by human-caused climate change. And, concerningly, scientists found significant intensification was happening to the strongest storms, making the most life-threatening hurricanes even more dangerous.
Rapid intensification has been historically hard to predict, but with climate change making oceans warmer, scientists are confident it is a phenomenon that will occur more often.
“All of this is just confirming what we expected,” Camargo said."

A large majority of Americans – 71% – believe the climate crisis is causing at least some harm to people in the US, while slightly less than two-thirds of the population believe harmful climate impacts will get worse over their lifetimes, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
The poll shows Americans have a “dim view” on how climate change is impacting the nation, said Alec Tyson, associate director of science and society at the Pew Research Center and a lead pollster on the report.
While Pew has done polling in the past on how Americans view climate change policy and solutions like wind and solar energy, this is the first time they took a hard look at Americans’ perception of the threat climate change may pose to their lives. The team surveyed 8,842 US adults online from Sept. 25 to Oct. 1.
After a summer of extreme weather – like the deadly Southwestern heat wave and devastating Vermont floods – Tyson’s team wanted to examine whether the impacts were making an impression on the American public.
“What we wanted to do with this survey was to focus more on the perceived personal impacts to the country and folks’ own lives,” Tyson said, calling it Pew’s “most dedicated effort” to-date focusing on “what people think is going to happen in their own lives” when it comes to climate change.
Pew found nearly half of Americans expect to have to make minor sacrifices over the course of their lifetimes due to climate impacts, while around a quarter of Americans think they’ll have to make major sacrifices. Another 28% expect to make no sacrifices at all due to climate change. Tyson told CNN the Pew team didn’t specify what kinds of sacrifices qualified as major or minor.
The Pew survey found deep partisan divisions impact people’s perceptions of climate change; for instance, 86% of Democrats expect negative climate impacts to get worse during their lifetime, while just 37% of Republicans said the same.
“Nothing matters more than partisanship,” Tyson noted, adding that factors like age and geographical location weren’t as strong as partisan divides in influencing opinions on climate change. “Democrats foresee much greater negative impacts from climate (change) over the coming decade, Republicans not so much.”
Tyson and the team at Pew found that where people lived and what age they are also impacts how they view climate change. For instance, a majority of those polled nationally said they expected that coastal Florida, Southern California and the Southwest will become worse places to live over the next 30 years due to the effects of climate change.
About half of adults polled who live in the Western US said they expect climate change will make conditions in their region worse, compared to just 30% of Midwestern residents who said the same.
“Climate experts talk about how impacts may be more severe in some places than others; that concept seems to resonate with the public,” Tyson said. “That’s quite striking.”"

An ancient landscape hidden under the East Antarctic ice sheet for at least 14 million years has been revealed with the help of satellite data and planes equipped with ice-penetrating radar.
Scientists used the remote sensing techniques to map 32,000 square kilometers (12,300 square miles) of land — an area around the same size as Belgium. They discovered a landscape formed by rivers prior to the continental build-up of the East Antarctic ice sheet that would have once resembled the hills and valleys of present-day North Wales, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.
The researchers set out to chart the history of the ice sheet and how it evolved over time, and understanding how the land looked before it was hidden beneath the frozen layers is an important chapter in that story, explained lead study author Stewart Jamieson, a professor in the department of geography at the University of Durham.

“The land underneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is less well known than the surface of Mars,” Jamieson said in a statement.
“And that’s a problem because that landscape controls the way that ice in Antarctica flows, and it controls the way it might respond to past, present and future climate change,” he added.
The well-preserved nature of the landscape makes it particularly special. It is rare to find relatively unmodified landscapes underneath a continental ice sheet — normally the movement of the ice as it fluctuates in size and moves would erode and grind down the relic landscape, Jamieson said.
Understanding why this specific ancient landscape survived largely unscathed could help scientists better predict the future dynamics of the East Antarctic ice sheet, which contains the equivalent of approximately 60 meters of potential sea level rise, as the planet gets warmer.
Earth’s climate is on course to reach temperatures typical of those experienced when the landscape likely originated 34 to 14 million years ago — which were between 3 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius higher than today — according to the study.
The East Antarctic ice sheet first formed around 34 million years ago, but it would have subsequently fluctuated in size, sometimes revealing the land beneath. Jamieson said the survival of landscape implied that temperatures at the base of the icesheet had been extra cold and stable over these blocks of ancient terrain, despite some intervening periods of climate warming.

“In other areas, we’d actually expect there to be liquid water, right between the ice and the bed, which helps grind stuff away. We don’t have that in our location. So that partly explains how something could survive for so long,” Jamieson explained in a phone interview.
The geophysical data gathered by the scientists provided clues about what lay under the 2-kilometer-thick ice.
“(The data) effectively measures very small changes in the shape of the top of the ice and basically when we look at that and draw it out it looks like a series of interconnected valleys that must be underneath the icesheet. We’re basically seeing the ghost of that landscape from the top,” Jamieson said.
The research team does not know what plant and wildlife might once have inhabited the area, but the evidence of rivers suggested flowing water was present, making it highly likely the landscape was vegetated."

Rapid melting of West Antarctica’s ice shelves may now be unavoidable as human-caused global warming accelerates, with potentially devastating implications for sea level rise around the world, new research has found.
Even if the world meets ambitious targets to limit global heating, West Antarctica will experience substantial ocean warming and ice shelf melting, according to the new study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Ice shelves are tongues of ice that jut out into the ocean at the end of glaciers. They act like buttresses, helping hold ice back on the land, slowing its flow into the sea and providing an important defense against sea level rise. As ice shelves melt, they thin and lose their buttressing ability.
While there has been growing evidence ice loss in West Antarctica may be irreversible, there has been uncertainty about how much can be prevented through climate policies.
The researchers looked at “basal melting,” when warm ocean currents melt the ice from beneath. They analyzed the rate of ocean warming and ice shelf melting under different climate change scenarios. These ranged from the ambitious, where the world manages to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to the worst-case, where humans burn large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels.
They found if the world limits temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which it is not on track to do, climate change could still cause the ocean to warm at three times the historical rate.
Even significantly cutting planet-heating pollution now will have “limited power” to prevent warmer oceans from triggering the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the report found.
“It appears that we may have lost control of the West Antarctic ice melting over the 21st century,” said Kaitlin Naughten, an ocean modeler with the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the study.
West Antarctica is already the continent’s largest contributor to global sea level rise and has enough ice to raise sea levels by an average of 5.3 meters, or more than 17 feet. It’s home to the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the “Doomsday glacier,” because its collapse could raise sea levels by several feet, forcing coastal communities and low-lying island nations to either build around sea level rise or abandon these places, Naughten said.
While the study focused on ice shelf melting and did not directly quantify the impacts on sea level rise, “we have every reason to expect that sea level rise would increase as a result, as West Antarctica speeds up this loss of ice into the ocean,” Naughten said.
Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the study, said the findings are “sobering.” They build on existing research that paints an alarming picture of what’s happening to the planet’s southernmost continent, he told CNN.
“The thing that’s depressing is the committed nature of sea level rise, particularly for the next century,” Scambos told CNN. “People who are alive today are going to see a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise in all the coastal cities around the world.”
The only way to really stop the rapid ice melting, Scambos said, would be not just to cut levels of planet-heating pollution but also to “remove some that has already built up.” This will be “a real challenge,” he said.
Some scientists sounded a note of caution about the study. Tiago Segabinazzi Dotto, senior research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, said it should be “treated carefully” as it is based on a single model.
However, its conclusions do agree with previous research in the region, he told the Science Media Center, giving “confidence that this study needs to be taken in consideration for policymakers.”
Naughten and her colleagues acknowledged their study has limits — predicting future rates of melting in West Antarctica is very complex and it’s impossible to account for every possible future outcome. But, looking at the range of scenarios, the report authors said they were confident the melting of ice shelves is now unavoidable.
“The question of doom and gloom is something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about with this study, because how do you tell such a bad news story?” Naughten said.
“Conventional wisdom is supposed to give people hope, and I don’t see a lot of hope in this story,” she added, “but it’s what the science tells me and it’s what I have to communicate to the world.”
West Antarctic ice shelf melting is one impact of climate change “we are probably just going to have to adapt to and that very likely means some amount of sea level rise we cannot avoid,” Naughten said.
But although the outlook is dire, humanity cannot give up on slashing fossil fuel emissions, Naughten said. Devastating impacts can still be avoided in other parts of Antarctica and the rest of the world, she noted."
"A classic El Niño winter is expected this year, forecasters say. Here’s what that means for snow and cold",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/us/noaa-winter-weather-outlook-climate/index.html,"A classic El Niño winter is expected this year, forecasters say. Here’s what that means for snow and cold
El Niño will drive what could be a warmer or wetter winter in parts of the US this year, according to an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday.
But don’t worry, snow lovers. El Niño – a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – could also mean higher snow chances in some atypical spots and fuel more potent northeast snowstorms, forecasters say.
El Niño is forecast to be strong this winter and reach the most significant level since a very strong El Niño fostered the warmest winter on record across the US mainland during 2015-2016, according to NOAA.
While no two El Niño winters are the same, this shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the north becomes drier and warmer.
And that’s exactly what’s expected this winter. Above-average temperatures are likely across much of the northern US, according to NOAA’s outlook.
Parts of the Northwest, Great Lakes and Northeast have the highest likelihood of above-average temperatures. This will be a dramatic change for parts of the Northwest after last winter ended cooler than average for the region.
It’ll be yet another warm winter for the Great Lakes and Northeast. Last winter was one of the warmest on record for both regions, according to data from NOAA.
When forecasters predict above-average, temperatures for an entire season it doesn’t mean there won’t be any cold, just that old bouts may be less frequent and last for shorter periods of time.
Outside of an area of near-normal temperatures expected for parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Texas, there is not a strong signal across the rest of the US, according to NOAA. Much of the southern half of the country has equal chances of being near normal, above normal or below normal.
The same cannot be said of precipitation.
A large area of the southern US from the Plains through the Southeast is expected to see above-average precipitation this winter. This precipitation could fall in the form of rain, snow or an icy mix of both.
More precipitation would be welcome news for some states that are battling intense drought, including Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
Southern cities like Lubbock, Texas, and Little Rock, Arkansas, average less than 8 inches of snow per year, but even these minimal snow amounts climb during an El Niño winter.
This southern precipitation pattern is one of El Niño’s winter signatures. El Niño tends to shift the jet stream south over the US. Because the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through, storms can then move across the South with increased frequency and increase the chances of precipitation.
The mid-Atlantic and far southern New England are also likely to see more precipitation than normal this winter. El Niño typically favors a less-active, west-to-east storm track across the northern US, but the Northeast will still be prone to snowy nor’easters.
During an El Niño winter, nor’easters can get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
“With the right timing, these storms can really explode off the East Coast,” Gottschalck explained.
Typically, much of the Northeast gets less snow than normal in an El Niño winter – this is true for both interior cities like Albany, New York, and coastal cities like Boston.
But this winter, a majority of the region has equal chances to record near-normal, above normal or below normal precipitation.
“There’s hope for snow lovers,” Gottschalck said.
Drier weather is likely across other sections of the northern US, which is fairly typical for an El Niño winter. NOAA’s outlook highlights the northern Rockies and Great Lakes as the places most likely to have less precipitation than average this winter.
Parts of the central and southern Rockies and the central Plains will lean wetter than average this winter.
Near- or above-normal precipitation would help drought-stricken states, including Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska. Water levels on parts of the Mississippi River have plummeted to historic low levels as a result of ongoing drought, and winter is when these levels are able to recharge.
A wet winter is also expected across much of California. The state was pummeled by many atmospheric river events in rapid succession last winter through early spring, which led the state to one of its wettest winters in history, according to data from NOAA."

Follow:
Editor’s Note: Kottie Christie-Blick is a climate change education consultant, course instructor for the University of San Diego, California, and a mother. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.
Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
Every parent worries about when, and how, to have a conversation with their children about the birds and the bees. Are they old enough? How much detail should I give? Will they understand? What do they know already?
The reality is that the information is already out there. It’s in the news and it’s being discussed in schools. It’s across social media. It’s written into plot lines in books and shows. And it’s not just adults discussing it – so are kids.
And by the birds and the bees, I’m referring to climate change and its effect on plants and animals and people around the world. We need to address it head on.
As much as you’d like to be able to tell your children climate change isn’t something they need to be concerned about, you know you can’t. It’s here. We are all seeing it, many of us are dealing with its impact already and it’s going to get worse. How much worse depends on how quickly we can reduce adding greenhouse gases to the air.
Just like other grown-up issues your children need to face, it’s best if they learn about climate change from you, as well as their science teachers, climate scientists and other reliable sources who can give them accurate information (rather than the kid down the block). Ask them what they’ve heard about climate change and if they have any questions or concerns. Answer them openly and honestly.
Start with the basics. Explain why our planet is heating up and changing our weather patterns. Educate yourself first using reliable online resources, such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA, both US government agencies.
Or research together with your children. My website, “Kids Against Climate Change,” has child-friendly articles and videos for all age groups. Discuss what you’ve seen and read, both the facts and your feelings.
Could these air purification towers tackle India’s pollution problem?
If your children express anxiety over climate change, acknowledge their concerns. Make sure they have the correct facts; then assure them that there are grown-ups taking steps to slow down climate change. Project Drawdown highlights many effective actions being taken to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as replacing gas burning stoves, ovens, furnaces and boilers with those that run on electricity. Look at the website together and discuss your favorite ideas.
But you’ll have to acknowledge that it’s not enough. Everyone needs to be mindful to live more sustainably; that is, to live in a way that Earth’s natural resources (trees, clean water and even clean air) are not depleted.
The first place to start is to reduce waste: electricity, water, food. Turn off lights when not needed. Use less air conditioning and heat. Use less water. Take only the food you’ll eat. Explain that not only will this help the planet, it will save money in the family piggy bank.
Remember that actions speak louder than words, so the more your family can do to use less the better. Make a list of climate actions and post it on the fridge, such as turning off the water while brushing teeth, recycling, composting food scraps, unplugging chargers when not in use. Check them off when family members do them. I’ll bet your children would love to decorate the chart, perhaps with a colorful environmental theme. And if you want to be super cool parents, and give your children bragging rights at school, put solar panels on your house or buy an electric car.
As a family, be on the look-out for evidence of ways people are beginning to reduce their carbon footprint. Talk about what you see each day as you move through your community (electric cars and buses, new trees planted, shoppers using re-usable bags). Have a competitive family? Keep a tally sheet – one point for each person who spots evidence of environment-friendly action. Spend time in nature with your children, be it in your back garden or local park, a forest or the seaside. Enjoy the sights, sounds, smells and textures of the natural world. Your joy, and the sense of discovery you feel exploring it with your children, will encourage them to fall in love with the beauty and wonders of the natural environment and will make them want to take care of it.
There are many young people inspiring others to ramp up environmental stewardship. But kids don’t need to start a movement to do good. All they need to do is talk. Encourage them to speak up for sustainable living, and to remind everyone they know to reduce their waste and take action to reduce their share of environmental pollutants.
Ten photographs that made the world wake up to climate change
However, once again, you need to be honest and acknowledge that doing all of this is still not enough. Reducing environmental impact is also the responsibility of oil companies, technology and utility companies, the transportation sector, manufacturers, governments, investors and philanthropists and organizations such as the United Nations. Everyone needs to take steps to slow down climate change.
But these groups won’t take action without pressure from consumers and citizens. This is where your children really need your help, because as an adult you have more power. Help pressure these groups to take responsibility for cleaning the environment and mitigating climate change, and tell your children what you are doing. Don’t be surprised if they give you a pat on the back and say, “Job well done!” After all, it’s going to affect their future.
The best way to talk to your children about climate change is openly and honestly, and to give them hope by taking action together. The next step is to encourage everyone you know who has children they love to do the same.
And don’t forget to talk about the birds and the bees, and ways we can help all animals that are being impacted by climate change as well."
Climate group will spend $80 million to tout Biden’s environmental record,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/politics/climate-power-biden-campaign-ads/index.html,"Climate group will spend $80 million to tout Biden’s environmental record
Advocacy group Climate Power is committing $80 million in advertising to call attention to President Joe Biden’s climate and environment agenda ahead of the 2024 election, the group announced Monday.
The ad campaign broadly aims to inform voters about the president’s wide-ranging climate and clean energy agenda. As he took office, Biden set ambitious targets to cut the country’s planet-warming emissions. He also presided over the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest legislative climate investment in US history.
Yet even as Biden has directed his administration to prioritize climate change and clean energy, polling this summer shows his message isn’t getting through to voters.
A July Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found that less than a third of Americans polled knew a great deal about the IRA, compared to 71% who had heard a little or nothing about it. But the same poll found respondents broadly supportive of the initiatives in the bill, including tax subsidies to defray the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, solar panels, or energy efficient heating and cooling systems.
The same poll found 57% of Americans disapproved of how Biden has handled the issue of climate change.
“People overwhelmingly support what President Biden has done to combat climate change — but only if they hear about it,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “Our campaign plans to bridge the information gap around the clean energy plan by meeting Americans where they are and telling the story of our climate progress.”
Climate Power is launching digital and television ads and plans to continue spending on both platforms heading into 2024, according to a fact sheet provided by the group. It is launching a campaign to mobilize Latino voters on the issue and focusing on digital campaigns to reach young voters on social media. The group is also organizing in-person events in key battleground states including Arizona, Georgia and Michigan.
Climate Power has an ad campaign partnership with Future Forward, whose nonprofit arm helped pay for some of its spots so far this year.
In addition to Climate Power’s new campaign, Biden also received the support of four environmental groups earlier this year: LCV Action Fund, NextGen PAC, the Sierra Club and the NRDC Action Fund jointly endorsed Biden in June, the first time all four groups have done so.
The Biden administration has also received praise from the youth-led climate group the Sunrise Movement after moving to create the first ever American Climate Corps. But the president has also been criticized by environmental groups for green lighting some major fossil fuel projects, including the Willow Project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia.

"Climate change can have ‘lifelong impacts’ on young people’s mental health, report says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/health/climate-change-youth-mental-health/index.html,"Climate change can have ‘lifelong impacts’ on young people’s mental health, report says
Follow:
Climate change can play a major role in affecting young people’s mental health, according to a new report from the American Psychological Association.
Written in collaboration with the climate advocacy organization ecoAmerica, the report documents how environmental events linked to climate change – including weather disasters, extreme heat and poor air quality – can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues for kids and teens.
With climate change, health care providers should be more mindful of heat-related illness, doctors say
Natural disasters can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder in these groups, the report says. Longer-term problems like heat, drought and poor air quality can increase the risks of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, aggression, cognitive impairment and more.
“The report documents psychological harms that are happening right now to the children and youth in our country,” Dr. Dennis P. Stolle, the association’s senior director of applied psychology who reviewed the report, wrote in an email to CNN. “These are not issues that we can wait and resolve later. As a society, we must act now.”
The report, released Wednesday, serves as a follow-up to a 2021 study conducted by the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica. It’s the latest in a series of studies by the two organizations dating to 2014. The studies don’t involve new experiments; rather, they summarize existing research about climate change, mental health and youth development.
Problems begin before birth
According to Dr. Sue Clayton, a professor of psychology at the College of Wooster and the report’s lead author, climate change-related weather events leave kids more vulnerable to mental health consequences because young people might not have the coping strategies that adults do.
If a parent is stressed by hardship associated with an environmental event, like extreme heat or wildfires, it may influence their children’s mental health, as well.
The planet is getting hotter fast. This is what happens to your body in extreme heat
“If your parent is under stress because of worries or these fears, that can affect a child and their mental health,” Clayton said. “Experiencing trauma at an early age can have lifelong impacts on emotional health and well-being.”
Those mental health consequences begin even before a child is born, the report says. Prenatal exposure to weather disasters, high temperatures, air pollution and maternal anxiety can raise a child’s risk of a variety of behavioral and developmental issues, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, developmental delays, low self-control and psychiatric disorders.
The consequences can affect the development of the nervous system and are often irreversible, Clayton said.
For infants and young children, weather events linked to climate change – and exposure to news reports about them – could lead to anxiety, sleep troubles, PTSD, disrupted cognitive development and major depressive disorder.
Adolescents are susceptible to mental health effects – like trauma and anxiety – from climate change-related natural disasters, but they can also be indirectly affected, the report says. Weather events, heat and pollution can disrupt a child’s life: classes might be canceled, their home might be damaged, or they might experience food insecurity.
‘How do you plan for the future?’
Adolescents and young adults, the report says, are particularly anxious about climate change. Compared with their older counterparts, young people are more likely to be alarmed or concerned about the perceived failure of governments or authority figures to act on climate change.
According to the report, climate change-related events and distress about the issue are linked to risks of anxiety, depression, strained social relationships and suicide.
What to know when your child starts school during a deadly heat wave
“They’re worried about it because they know it’s going to affect their future,” Clayton said. “How do you plan for the future when you don’t know what the future will look like?”
She is also concerned about how climate change could influence young adults who are making decisions about their career and relationships. The report identified that the consequences of extreme weather and climate anxiety affected decision-making, impaired cognition and lower levels of self-control.
“They’re making the decisions that will affect the rest of their lives, in terms of their career goals and plans,” Clayton added. “Are they going to save money? What about their decisions about having children?”
The researchers note that not all young people experience the mental health impacts of climate change in the same way. People from marginalized or low-income backgrounds – including indigenous communities, communities of color, women and people with disabilities – are more likely to be exposed to extreme weather.
Compared with people in wealthier areas, they may also have fewer ways to cope with extreme weather. For instance, Clayton said, higher-income communities tend to have more tree cover from heat.

However, the report also stressed ways to limit the impact of climate change on youth mental health. Among its recommendations are that school systems play a greater role, including designing more protective facilities and teaching curricula about climate change.
Health care professionals could also screen early and regularly for climate-related distress among youth. Stolle says a greater number of clinical psychologists are treating people with anxiety about climate change.
“Clinical psychologists are finding themselves on the frontlines of treating the patients who are suffering from these concerns,” he wrote in his email.
But for Clayton, it’s not just an issue for health care professionals.
“This affects all of us,” she added. “Children are effectively the future of society. We wanted to make the information about the problem and potential ways of addressing it available to groups that want to get access to it.”

The Midwest US could be a hotspot for deadly ‘moist heat stress’ as global temperatures climb,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/us/midwest-moist-heat-stress-humidity-climate/index.html,"The Midwest US could be a hotspot for deadly ‘moist heat stress’ as global temperatures climb
Large parts of the world, including China and the Midwest US, are on track to become too hot for humans to handle as accelerating global temperatures expose billions to heat and humidity so extreme their bodies will no longer be able to cope, according to a new study.
Researchers used temperature and humidity data along with climate models to analyze humanity’s exposure to potentially lethal heat as the world warms, looking at a range of temperature increases from 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
They found that above 2 degrees Celsius of warming, a significant portion of the world’s population will be vulnerable to “moist heat stress” with devastating consequences for human health, according to the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The world has already warmed around 1.2 degrees Celsius.
“Moist heat stress is a particularly challenging problem, because it affects the human body directly, and causes morbidity and mortality,” said Matthew Huber, co-author of the study and a professor of Earth’s atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue University.
When levels of heat and humidity are high, sweat evaporates much more slowly than usual meaning its cooling effect is lost and the body can become unable to regulate its temperature. This can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which can cause heart attacks and organ failure. The old, the very young and those with pre-existing health conditions are most vulnerable to heat illness.
Temperatures that surpass human tolerance have been breached only a few times in human history, and for a few hours at a time in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, according to the report.
But as temperatures continue to rise, many more will be exposed and for much longer periods, the study found.
While countries have committed to limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, with the aim of 1.5 degrees Celsius, they are way off track. Even if global climate pledges are met — which the world is not currently on course to do — temperatures are expected to rise between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius, according to a recent UN report.
Above 2 degrees of warming, 2.2 billion people who live in Pakistan and the Indus River Valley in India, 1 billion people in China and 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa will experience many hours of heat and humidity a year that exceed human tolerance levels.
People in these regions will be even more vulnerable as many lack access to air conditioning or other ways to cool down, the report noted.
At 3 degrees — which the study authors say is the most likely level of warming by 2100 if no action is taken — there is a sharp increase in people exposed to life-threatening heat and humidity. “It’s really incredibly disturbing,” Huber told CNN.
Humid heat waves will affect swaths of the world not used to such extreme conditions.
The Midwest US will become a “moist heat stress hotspot” at 3 degrees of warming, according to the report. The Midwest is susceptible to this kind of heat stress in part because its climate walks the line between dry and humid, Huber explained, allowing the region’s heat to push into the danger zone on very humid days.
Another factor that makes the region vulnerable is its agriculture and the phenomenon called “corn sweat,” Huber said.
“The plants that we eat are sweating through evapotranspiration, and that may be adding to the humidity above what would normally be there,” he said.
So-called “hot hours” — times where heat and humidity are especially life-threatening — will be concentrated in the Missouri and Mississippi River valleys but also elsewhere in US including the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic seaboard, according to the study.
At 4 degrees of warming, the study’s worst-case scenario, researchers found that 1.5 billion people around the world would face a month of moist heat stress each year, and roughly 2.7 billion people will experience at least a week of these extreme conditions.
Parts of Yemen could experience heat and humidity that exceeds human tolerance for more than 300 days a year, making it virtually uninhabitable.
“Around the world, official strategies for adapting to the weather focus on temperature only,” Qinqin Kong of Purdue University and a study co-author, said in a statement. “But this research shows that humid heat is going to be a much bigger threat than dry heat.”
Keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius by cutting planet heating pollution will sharply reduce global exposure to life-threatening heat and humidity, the report found.
“Every tenth of a degree or anything like that afterwards plays a role, and we want to reduce warming as fast as we can,” Daniel Vecellio, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at George Mason University, told CNN. “If we get to these emissions reductions faster, here’s all the people we can save, here’s all the lifestyles that don’t have to be changed.”
Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study but was a lead author on the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, said the study’s conclusions are “compelling” but not surprising. “Extreme heat is already responsible for countless deaths worldwide every year,” Cobb told CNN.
“It’s important to underscore, as this study does, that heat is not an equal opportunity killer. It disproportionately kills people in lower income communities, often communities of color. This is as true here in the US as it is around the globe.”"

Philippe, a former tropical storm that is swiping Bermuda on Friday, will combine with a potent cold front to drench the Northeast and deliver gusty winds to parts of New England this weekend.
Philippe had 50 mph winds and was making its closest approach to Bermuda Friday afternoon. It is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the island throughout the day.
The system has transitioned into a more sprawling, wet and windy mess known as a post-tropical storm, and is on track to hit Maine Saturday night. A soggy, miserable weekend is likely across much of the Northeast, with the greatest chances for heavy rain likely in northern New England.
Rain instigated by the cold front is already starting to work its way into far western parts of the Northeast Friday and will keep moving east through the weekend.
A Level 2 of 4 slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in areas where repeated bouts of rain could trigger localized flash flooding.
Much of the Northeast is coming off of one of its wettest summers on record, NOAA data shows. The wet trend has only continued into fall, raising the risk for flash flooding.
Parts of the Northeast were inundated by record-breaking rainfall last week. The most intense rainfall hit the New York City tri-state, where floodwaters inundated subways, roads and basements and several locations recorded the wettest day in history.
Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine.
Fall foliage is nearing or at peak condition in parts of Maine, so the timing of Philippe’s drenching rainfall could disrupt leaf peeping plans this weekend.
In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday night into Sunday as Philippe comes ashore.
Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are likely in Maine, with potential for stronger gusts on the coast. Lesser gusty winds will be more widespread across New England."

The tropical storm has 50 mph winds and is still hundreds of miles from the US. Philippe is expected to transition into a post-tropical storm by the time it makes landfall in Maine or Atlantic Canada Saturday night, but this will have little effect on Philippe’s ability to unload heavy rainfall and spread gusty winds.
Philippe’s projected track has echoes of Hurricane Lee in September, when the much-weakened post-tropical system brought strong winds and rain to parts of the Northeast and Canada.

In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday and Saturday night as Philippe nears landfall. Philippe’s winds are expected to remain at tropical-storm strength, but the cyclone itself will not be fully tropical at the time of landfall.
Bermuda at risk for tropical strike
Philippe has quite a distance to travel before approaching the US and Canada but it will soon come in close contact with Bermuda. The island’s weather service issued a tropical storm warning Wednesday evening as Philippe closed in.
Bermuda is only 15 miles across, so landfalls are rare. Only eleven systems have made landfall on the island since 1851, according to data from NOAA. But Philippe won’t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain.
Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are likely across Bermuda when Philippe makes its closest pass on Friday. Rain arrived on Thursday afternoon, ahead of any wind.
Philippe is expected to be a tropical storm as it swipes the island, so the risk of widespread damage is limited, but power outages are possible."

The storm’s severity on Bermuda will depend on just how strong it is and how close it tracks to the island. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are likely when Philippe makes its closest pass on Friday. Rain will arrive ahead of any wind and could begin as early as Thursday across the island.
Philippe is expected to be a tropical storm as it swipes the island, so the risk of widespread damage is limited, but power outages are possible."
Temperatures are about to come crashing down with a dramatic fall pattern change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/04/weather/fall-temperature-drop-pattern-change-climate/index.html,"Temperatures are about to come crashing down with a dramatic fall pattern change
A dramatic change is on the way as a robust cold front delivers the first hefty dose of fall weather by the weekend, sending temperatures tumbling by as much as 35 degrees.
The cooldown is welcome news for millions in the South that have endured a brutally hot summer and a roasting start to fall.
Relief from the heat will make it as far south as the Gulf Coast. States like Louisiana — which endured its hottest summer on record this year — will have below-normal afternoon temperatures for the first time since spring.
The change will begin in portions of the Plains and Midwest that have been baking in record-breaking October heat since Saturday. Dozens of daily temperature records have fallen there, and some cities in Minnesota and Michigan smashed all-time October temperature records.
While the most brutal heat will soon come to an end across the north-central US, summerlike heat is only beginning to build for the Northeast. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal October levels will be common through Thursday across the Great Lakes and Northeast.
It won’t last for long. The coldest air of the season will arrive late this week and usher in conditions that haven’t been felt since early May across the northern US.
Where temperatures will drop dramatically
A one-two punch of cold air from two separate cold fronts will surge across the central US starting Wednesday and expand into the eastern US Friday and through the weekend.
High temperatures from the Great Lakes to New York could drop by as much as 35 degrees by the weekend. Temperature drops of 20 degrees will be more widespread.
The first cold front will bring relief to states in the north-central US from Wednesday to Thursday. Places like Minneapolis, where record-breaking temperatures soared into the 90s on Sunday, may not make it out of the 60s on Wednesday.
The second cold front will be much more potent and usher in the season’s first push of truly autumn air for the central and eastern US. Chilly, Canadian air will surge southward as the cold front digs across the eastern two-thirds of the continental US from Thursday to Sunday.
Places like Detroit and Cleveland – that soar into the upper 80s on Wednesday – may not climb out of the low 50s on Sunday. Philadelphia and New York City will likely bask in the 80s through at least Wednesday, but by Sunday, high temperatures will struggle to reach the low 60s.
Overnight low temperatures will also plummet behind these fronts.
Low temperatures in the upper 30s to low 50s are likely across the north-central US and Midwest by Saturday morning, and in the Northeast by Sunday morning.
The first frost of the season is possible for portions of northern states like North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin as temperatures drop into the low to middle 30s.
Chilly fall weather should stick around early this month, especially in the eastern US. Below-average temperatures are likely from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast through at least the middle of next week, according to the Climate Prediction Center.
Rain and storms to accompany fronts
The dramatic cooldown won’t be the only noticeable weather change this week. The clash between cold, autumnal air and steamy, summerlike air will create stormy weather.
The storm threat on Wednesday will stretch from the southern Plains to the Midwest. Some storms may turn severe on Wednesday afternoon, mainly in Texas and Oklahoma.
Any rain from these storms is sorely needed in Texas, where 80% of the state is experiencing at least moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. From Tuesday through Wednesday, 0.75 to 1.50 inches of rain could fall across much of the state, with higher amounts possible in areas worked over by multiple storms.
Rain and thunderstorms will continue to march slowly eastward and impact portions of the eastern US Thursday and Friday, while wet weather continues in the Midwest.
Periods of heavy rain are possible the Northeast over the weekend. Any heavy rainfall could pose an issue for parts of the region plunged underwater by flooding rainfall last week."
This storm chaser captures stunning photographs of extreme weather,https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/storm-chaser-sarah-hasan-al-sayegh-climate-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"This storm chaser captures stunning photographs of extreme weather
Follow:
In 2023, it isn’t hard to imagine we’re living through the end times, with apocalyptic weather events happening throughout the year and across the globe.
Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a “staggering rise in climate-related disasters,” according to the UN. Between 2000 and 2019, 3.9 billion people were affected by 6,681 climate-related disasters, compared with 3.2 billion affected by 3,656 such events between 1980 and 1999.
By chasing down storms, one woman is throwing herself in the path of some of the most destructive wild forces on planet Earth, recording images that could help us understand and predict extreme weather events.
Ad Feedback
Though she is an accountant by trade, Sarah Hasan Al-Sayegh calls herself the first Kuwaiti-Arab female storm chaser. When she isn’t crunching numbers, Al-Sayegh tracks ferocious storms, to both photograph nature’s wild beauty and document our changing weather systems.
Photographing our changing weather
Before she began storm-chasing, Al-Sayegh, 40, photographed landscapes and cityscapes as a hobby. Her enthusiasm for meteorological phenomena was ignited by chance.
In 2011, she went out to shoot a landscape. “All of a sudden, this huge Haboob dust storm [was] coming towards me, and I was fascinated with it,” recalls Al-Sayegh.
“Haboob is an Arabic term … a wall of cloud that forms when there is a low-level jet coming from the north and it will lift the dust,” she explains.
“I was like, how did that happen? How is that possible? And I was hooked from that moment.”
Since then, Al-Sayegh has been photographing the storms that sweep across Kuwait and the Arabian Peninsula.
“I want to know how storms are happening, how tornadoes are happening,” she says. Even with no meteorological background, Al-Sayegh has noticed changes in the weather patterns in the Middle East. “Storm chasing made me see the world more,” she says. “It helped me to realize that climate change is something real, it’s a serious thing.”
There have been a number of extreme weather events in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. In March and April 2019, parts of Iran, Iraq and Syria were devastated by heavy floods.
Last year, sandstorms hit the region from Dubai to Syria, with Iraq hit particularly hard. Sandstorms are happening with unprecedented frequency, experts say, driven partly by climate change. And this month, nearly 4,000 people were killed by flooding in Libya, according to UN figures, the result of extreme rainfall brought by Storm Daniel.
“In the past five or six years, [there have been] tornadoes in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates, in Qatar and also in Kuwait,” says Al-Sayegh. She says storm chasers can help inform meteorology, but adds that they aren’t taken seriously in the Middle East.
For her part, Al-Sayegh collects her photographs and video footage and compares it with the prediction data she puts together for each chase. She then posts the information on social media and shares it with accounts that monitor international weather phenomena.
A dangerous pursuit
Storm chasing requires planning, patience, and complicated data-analysis. Mistakes can mean missing out on the action or even putting yourself in danger. Al-Sayegh says that the unpredictable forces of nature are not to be taken lightly. “I have to have an exit plan,” she says.
Al-Sayegh recalls that on May 31, 2016, she and fellow storm chaser Mike Olbinski came across a huge storm structure near Lamesa, Texas. “We were taking images and suddenly heard a roaring thunder and felt some electricity,” she says. “After looking at Mike’s video footage of the chase day we realized that the lightning struck just feet away from us.”
Al-Sayegh acknowledges that storm chasing is predominantly a male-dominated activity, particularly in the Gulf region, and is hopeful that more Arab women will take it up following her example.
“I would like to say to all the girls who want to be storm chasers or go into male-dominated jobs: just go for it,” says Al-Sayegh. “Don’t let people say that you cannot do it because you’re a female.”
Al-Sayegh is yet to see the chaser’s holy grail - a tornado - first-hand on the Arabian Peninsula. But she has captured images of some astonishing cloud formations, such as a huge “supercell” or “rotating thunderstorm” that resembles a flying saucer.
She now hopes to expand her meteorological knowledge and raise awareness around climate change. “I just hope to be able to put that message to everybody through my photography and through my storm chasing,” Al-Sayegh says."

‘Not nearly enough.’ IEA says fossil fuel demand will peak soon but urges faster action
Global demand for oil, natural gas and coal is likely to peak by 2030 — an “encouraging” development but “not nearly enough” to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.
Planet-heating pollution from the energy sector is also set to peak this decade, the IEA said in an update to its landmark “Net Zero Roadmap” report.
Fatih Birol, the agency’s executive director, told reporters Tuesday that the “path to the 1.5 degrees target is narrowing” but there were “legitimate reasons to be hopeful.”
“Mainly, we are seeing that a new clean energy economy is emerging around the world,” he said.
Scientists consider warming of 1.5 degrees a threshold beyond which extreme heat, floods, droughts, wildfires, and food and water shortages will have a catastrophic impact. This year’s summer in the Northern Hemisphere was the world’s hottest on record, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
Scientists also say that to stay in line with the 1.5 degree cap, global greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by 2050 on a net basis, taking account of all the emissions produced and removed from the atmosphere.
Since the original publication of the “Net Zero Roadmap” report in 2021, the world has seen “record growth” in solar power capacity, as well as bumper sales of electric vehicles, the IEA wrote.
In the past two years, “solar became the king of electricity markets,” Birol said. “The old king — coal — is over, and now solar is the new king… the cost is coming down.”
Two years ago, he added, one in every 25 new cars sold around the world was electric. This year, that share has increased to one in every five.
And more than 80% of the emissions reductions needed by 2030 can be achieved through expanding renewable energy sources, increasing electrification, improving energy efficiency and cutting methane emissions, according to the IEA.
‘Herculean task’
Still, limiting global warming is a “herculean task,” Birol said, noting that achieving the 1.5 degree target would require a 25% plunge in demand for fossil fuels by 2030 compared with current levels.
The IEA calculates that investments in clean energy worldwide will need to more than double from the $1.8 trillion projected for this year to $4.5 trillion every year by the early 2030s. Staying on track for 1.5 degrees also means that almost all countries must move forward their target dates for achieving net-zero carbon emissions, it wrote Tuesday.
Meanwhile, carbon capture, utilization and storage — a set of technologies that prevents carbon going into the atmosphere at the source of the pollution — as well as hydrogen-based energy and biofuels require “rapid progress” by 2030.
The world’s leaders are due to gather in Dubai for the United Nations’ COP28 climate summit in late November to assess the global progress toward limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.
Pushback
In its 2021 report, the IEA said that, to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, investment in new oil and gas projects must stop immediately, and no new coal-fired plants should be approved.
But some of the world’s fossil fuel producers have ignored that call. In July, the UK government announced plans to allow a big expansion of drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said at the time that he hoped the plans would provide Britain with domestically sourced energy while the country transitioned to a net-zero economy by 2050.
In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — a group that includes the world’s largest crude oil exporter Saudi Arabia — said that halting investment in new oil and gas projects would set up the global energy system to fail “spectacularly.”
“It would lead to energy chaos on a potentially unprecedented scale, with dire consequences for economies and billions of people across the world,” Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC’s secretary-general, said in a statement.
Oil prices have surged in recent months following a decision by OPEC and its leading ally Russia to slash crude supplies in a bid to prop up prices.
Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained 28% since a low in late June to trade near $93 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has risen by a similar margin to $89 a barrel.

Extreme heat scorches large parts of South America as winter ends,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/25/americas/extreme-heat-south-america-brazil-climate-intl/index.html,"Extreme heat scorches large parts of South America as winter ends
This weekend may have marked the beginning of spring in the Southern Hemisphere, but it felt like the peak of summer across several countries in South America, where temperatures pushed above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil have all experienced record September temperatures, with some all-time records at risk of falling as the heat continues into the week.
The very high temperatures are the result of a heat dome, which occurs when a ridge of high pressure builds over an area and stays for days or even weeks, trapping hot air. El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean, has also increased the heat, as has the underlying trend of human-caused global warming.
Peru has experienced some of the most extreme temperatures in September, which is usually a temperate month.
The town of Puerto Esperanza saw temperatures climb above 40 degrees Celsius, an extreme rarity for the country, and only 1 degree Celsius shy of the its all-time highest temperature of 41.1 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit).
Towns and cities across several other South American countries also saw September heat records topple on Sunday, including:
Heat was particularly widespread in Brazil, where temperatures reached 40 degrees Celsius in 11 states on Sunday, according to weather company MetSul Meteorologia.
São Paulo reached 36.5 degrees Celsius (98 Fahrenheit), the city’s highest September temperature since 1943, according to INMET, the national meteorological service. These scorching temperatures capped off the city’s warmest winter in more than six decades.
Abnormally high temperatures have also increased the fire risk in the country, with wildfires breaking out last week in Bahia state.
The extreme heat is expected to continue across parts of South America well into this week, with the potential for more records to be broken.
“More of the same – or worse – is unavoidable,” said Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian who tracks extreme temperatures.
Other parts of the Southern Hemisphere are also experiencing an exceptionally hot spring, including Australia, which is grappling with unusually high temperatures and dozens of bushfires. The country is experiencing “a September like none before, after the warmest winter on record,” Herrera said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).
Between June and August, 98% of humanity experienced climate change-fueled temperatures, according to a recent analysis from climate research group Climate Central.
“In every country we could analyze, including the Southern Hemisphere where this is the coolest time of year, we saw temperatures that would be difficult — and in some cases nearly impossible — without human-caused climate change,” Andrew Pershing, vice president of science for Climate Central, said in a statement earlier this month.
Extreme heat is one of the clearest signs of climate change, as humans continue to burn planet-heating fossil fuels. The Northern Hemisphere experienced its hottest summer on record this year, with June, July and August all breaking global monthly heat records.
As the abnormal heat continues, the signs are pointing to September also being the hottest such month on record.
There is now a more than a 93% chance that this year will be the warmest on record, according to the United States’ National Atmospheric and Oceanographic Administration.

An El Niño winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/25/weather/el-nino-winter-us-climate/index.html,"An El Niño winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US
Fall has only just begun, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially since this one may look drastically different than recent years because of El Niño.
This winter will be the first in a few years to feel the effects of the phenomenon, which has a sizable impact on the weather during the coldest months of the year.
El Niño is one of three phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which tracks water temperature changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that can have rippling effects on weather patterns around the globe. The El Niño phase occurs when these ocean temperatures are warmer than normal for an extended period.
This year’s El Niño began in June, is expected to be strong this winter and last at least into early next spring, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
El Niño’s cooler counterpart, La Niña, played a huge role in the past three winters across the US, keeping the South dry while parts of the West received a lot of much-needed snow.
Early winter predictions from the Climate Prediction Center have many of the hallmarks of typical El Niño winters, auguring changes to come.
What could this winter look like?
No two El Niño winters are the same, but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common.
One of the major reasons is the position of the jet stream, which often shifts south during an El Niño winter. This shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the North becomes drier and warmer, according to NOAA.
Because the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through, they can move across the South with increased frequency during an El Niño winter. More storms means more precipitation, typically from the southern Plains to the Southeast. This could be crucial for states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi plagued by drought.
The combination of cooler weather and more frequent precipitation may also increase the chances for wintry precipitation like freezing rain, sleet and snow to fall in the South.
El Niño typically leads to a milder winter in the North, from the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies, Plains and Midwest. Individual storms can still form and deliver bouts of brutal cold or heavy snow to these regions, but they are typically less frequent.
This would be bad news for portions of the Midwest also dealing with extreme and exceptional levels of drought, and for snowpack in the Pacific Northwest – a key water source for the region.
El Niño winter patterns are less regular in California, the Southwest and the Northeast.
The frequency of storms and uptick in precipitation across California and portions of the Southwest may depend on the overall strength of the El Niño. A stronger El Niño may lead to more storms, low elevation rain and high elevation snow, while a weaker version could hang the Southwest out to dry.
The Northeast doesn’t have a well-defined set of expectations during an El Niño winter. The region can be milder overall like its other northern counterparts, but it can also be at the mercy of robust coastal storms moving along the Atlantic Coast.
Looking back at recent El Niño winters can also help visualize what the upcoming winter may have in store:"
Opinion: Biden’s American Climate Corps could be the lasting legacy of this generation,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/24/opinions/american-climate-corps-americorps-youth-smith/index.html,"Opinion: Biden’s American Climate Corps could be the lasting legacy of this generation
Follow:
Editor’s Note: Michael D. Smith is the Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps, the federal agency for national service and volunteerism. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles at CNN.
“National service, I hope and pray, will help us to strengthen the cords that bind us together as a people.”
Those were the words of President Bill Clinton 30 years ago this week when he signed the National and Community Service Trust Act, formally establishing AmeriCorps. Just a year later, 20,000 Americans took the AmeriCorps pledge to serve. This was the beginning of an unprecedented bipartisan movement of community-driven service and solutions.
Over the course of 30 years, 1.25 million AmeriCorps members have joined the movement, serving and mentoring millions of students, supporting veterans re-entering the workforce, rebuilding homes after disasters, helping preserve endangered Native languages, and offering pathways for justice-impacted Americans – a second chance.
A movement is exactly what it will take to address the greatest rising threat to humanity: a warming climate. President Joe Biden’s newly announced American Climate Corps — an interagency initiative between AmeriCorps, the Departments of Labor, Energy, Interior, Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — will take this challenge head-on by training and preparing the American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience.
In 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps (the “CCC”) began putting people to work, from addressing the ravages of the Dust Bowl, a catastrophic drought that devastated farmlands across the prairies, to collectively planting more than three billion trees. The CCC would restore the soil health of farmlands in the Heartland and power the Colorado River by constructing the Hoover Dam. Their work transformed the very landscape of America.
Now, 90 years later, the American Climate Corps will focus not only on climate change, but climate justice. With equity at its core, unlike the CCC, the American Climate Corps will unite Americans in service, provide a pathway to good-paying union jobs and strengthen the economy for all.
President Biden’s American Climate Corps marks a new era for youth-powered climate action in America – to reforest lands, preserve waterways, make urban, rural and tribal communities more climate resilient; and advance energy-efficiency projects. It’s a bold vision for America’s future – one that is necessary.
None of us are immune from the impacts of the climate crisis. Just this past summer, we all experienced historic heat, wildfires, 101-degree ocean temperatures, record flooding and lengthy droughts.
And while a changing climate threatens us all, we know it disproportionately harms communities of color the most.
In Alaska, rising seas force Native communities to relocate away from their traditional homelands. In Rolling Fork, Mississippi, a tornado leveled a predominately Black community. More recently, wildfires devastated Maui, reducing entire neighborhoods to ash. Any strategy to address climate change without an equal emphasis on equity would turn a blind eye on those most closely impacted.
That’s why President Biden called on the American Climate Corps to prioritize environmental justice. Members will represent the diversity of America — a rich mosaic of cultures, backgrounds and identities — because those who feel it most often hold the best solutions.
Everyone deserves a seat — or shall I say, a hard hat — in the American Climate Corps.
One of the first major partnerships under President Biden’s American Climate Corps is between AmeriCorps and the US Forest Service, establishing the new AmeriCorps NCCC Forest Corps. This five-year, $15 million agreement will deploy AmeriCorps members across the country to conserve national forests and grasslands, mitigate and respond to wildfires and reforest carbon-rich landscapes.
This partnership highlights the importance of collaboration across agencies and is a small example of what we can — and will –— take to scale with the American Climate Corps.
AmeriCorps has already been doing this work for years, funding organizations with innovative solutions. We engage 15,000 Americans annually, working to stem the disastrous effects of rising temperatures and extreme weather.
For example, Conservation Legacy, an AmeriCorps grantee, recruits post-9/11 veterans who serve on a new set of frontlines. Their mission: mitigating wildfires in high-risk communities and forests. Through workforce development, this program supports veterans transitioning from military service to civilian life. They provide boots on the ground, battling climate change.
So as we celebrate 30 years of AmeriCorps, we are looking to the future. Not only to the future of service, but to our role in uniting Americans in service across divides to build a sustainable economy that supports every American.
With the American Climate Corps we are expanding what is possible and living up to President Biden’s call “for a new era of national service.” How we come together as one people – one nation – to address the urgent climate crisis that threatens us all will be the lasting legacy of this generation."
"Sunak delays crucial UK climate targets, with one eye on the next election",https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/uk/uk-sunak-climate-targets-delay-gbr-intl/index.html,"Sunak delays crucial UK climate targets, with one eye on the next election
Britain will delay a series of key climate targets, its beleaguered Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Wednesday at a hastily organized press conference, in a move that angered businesses and political allies and intensified the government’s assault on green policies.
Sunak told reporters on Wednesday he will push back a ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, dramatically slow down plans to phase out gas boilers, and reject calls to regulate efficiency for homeowners.
The prime minister reiterated plans to expand oil and gas developments in Britain’s North Sea and drill for the fossil fuels that environmental groups condemned. He also announced that the ban on onshore wind will be lifted.
It marks a sharp turn away from a long-standing political consensus on the climate, just two years after the United Kingdom hosted the crucial COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and seriously undermines efforts to portray Britain as a leader in the fight against the climate crisis.
The move intensifies Sunak’s newfound and controversial electoral strategy: binning Britain’s bolder emissions-cutting policies and picking fights with climate activists, in a gamble that the confrontation will appeal to traditional Conservative voters.
Sunak, who is scrambling to reverse dismal opinion polling ahead of an election anticipated next year, sought to present the rollbacks as a “more pragmatic, proportionate and realistic” way of reaching net zero – framing the reversals as a longer-term and overdue change to approaching climate policies.
In an attack on his own Conservative predecessors as prime minister, Sunak said: “You don’t reach net zero simply by wishing it. Yet that’s precisely what previous governments have done, both Labour and Conservative.”
“This idea that we’re watering down our targets is just wrong,” he said, adding, “If we continue down this path, we risk losing the consent of the British people.”
He said he will “set out the next stage” of his environmental agenda in the coming weeks, ahead of COP28.
Boris Johnson, whose premiership included the COP26 and embraced the net zero pledge, had earlier shot back in a rare public attack on his former chancellor-turned-political rival. “Business must have certainty about our net zero commitments,” Johnson said in a statement, calling on Sunak to give firms “confidence that government is still committed Net Zero and can see the way ahead.”
“We cannot afford to falter now or in any way lose our ambition for this country,” Johnson said.
Political pushback
Sunak attempted to stake an occasionally awkward middle ground in his Wednesday speech, insisting his plans will keep Britain on track to reach net zero by 2050, while presenting the previous plans as overbearing and unfair on British workers.
“We’ve stumbled into a consensus about the future of our country that no one seems to be happy with,” Sunak said. “Too often, motivated by short-term thinking, politicians have taken the easy way out… I’ve made my decision: we are going to change.”
It’s an argument that will do little to convince climate experts, many of whom have warned the UK was already missing its targets. The Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent adviser on climate change, published a report in June that criticized the UK’s net zero plans and said there was not enough urgency to reach the country’s goals.
Britain is legally required to have reached net zero – meaning the country would remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits – by 2050.
But the delays in phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles and gas boilers will mean the products remain on Britain’s roads and homes well into the 2040s, potentially complicating any efforts by future governments to accelerate emissions-cutting plans.
There was a dramatic political pushback on Wednesday too. Johnson’s comments led a chorus of concerns from within Sunak’s Conservative party at the plans, which were apparently hurriedly brought forward after Tuesday’s leaks to the media. Opposition lawmakers, businesses and climate groups joined the green wing of the party in attacking the shift.
Alok Sharma, a Conservative politician who served as president of the pivotal COP26 conference, told the BBC before Sunak’s press conference on Wednesday that rowing back from the cross-party consensus on net zero would be “incredibly damaging for business confidence.”
“Frankly, I really do not believe that it’s going to help any political party electorally which chooses to go down this path,” Sharma added. Chris Skidmore, the Conservative former energy minister, told the PA Media news agency the moves were “the greatest mistake of his premiership.”
Wednesday’s announcement comes at the same time as the Climate Ambition Summit at the UN General Assembly summit in New York, which Sunak is not attending.
On the sidelines of the UN summit, former US vice president Al Gore told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he thought Sunak “has done the wrong thing.”
“I have heard from many of my friends in the UK – including a lot of Conservative party members, by the way – who have used the phrase ‘utter disgust’ and some of the young people there feel as if their generation has been stabbed in the back. It’s really shocking to me, but again this is an issue for the UK to handle,” he continued.
“From a global perspective, this is not what the world needs from the United Kingdom,” the climate campaigner added.
Also at the UN, Romain Ioualalen, a representative for environmental advocacy group Oil Change International, told CNN in a press briefing that Sunak’s announcement is a sign of “how far the UK has fallen when it comes to climate leadership.”
“At least from the point of view of civil society from around the world, we’re really profoundly concerned about what’s happening in the UK. And it’s a sign that science doesn’t seem to be listened to anymore with that government,” Ioualalen said.
An anti-green agenda
Sunak has leaned into an anti-green agenda since his party unexpectedly and narrowly won a by-election in the far western edge of London in July that was dominated by plans to extend London’s low-emissions zone, charging drivers of the most polluting vehicles a fee for every day they used their car in the area.
The prime minister’s Conservative party is deeply unpopular with voters, with opinion polls projecting anything from a comfortable defeat to a historic wipeout at the next general election, which must be called by January 2025 at the latest.
Amid that context, and with a struggling economy that leaves the government with little wiggle room for dramatic fiscal changes, Sunak has emphasized a range of cultural issues and trumpeted socially conservative policies in a push to appeal to the party’s rightwing base.
But polls show that the climate crisis is increasingly high on the list of British voters’ concerns, and the opposition Labour party has sought to attack Sunak on what they describe as a withdrawal from Britain’s former position as a global leader. “Rolling back on key climate commitments as the world is being battered by extreme flooding and wildfires would be morally indefensible,” Friends of the Earth’s head of policy, Mike Childs, said in a statement.
British businesses also criticized Sunak’s plans on Wednesday. Lisa Brankin, the chair of Ford UK, said in a statement that the automobile giant “needs three things from the UK Government: ambition, commitment and consistency. A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three.”
And Ed Matthew, Campaigns Director for independent climate change think tank E3G, said the moves would drive up household bills and “damage the UK’s ability to compete with other countries on clean technology.”
“Just as the United States, China and the European Union are racing ahead on green growth, Rishi Sunak appears ready to surrender,” he said. “The economic damage to the UK could be catastrophic.”

“We’ve seen a concerted effort to ramp up the fear when it comes to things like global warming and climate change,” DeSantis said.
In response to a question from CNN about concerns people have over recent instances of flooding and wildfire smoke, the governor acknowledged that climate disasters were “problematic” but said that the federal reaction to such threats needs to be “a little more realistic.”
His comments come as communities across the globe are facing intensifying natural disasters, from wildfires across Canada to historic deadly flooding in Libya. DeSantis leads a state as vulnerable to climate change as any in the country. As governor, he has taken steps to harden Florida’s coastline against rising sea levels. Yet his comments Wednesday were among the most forceful to date in rejecting the scientific consensus surrounding man-made global warming.
“We deal with hurricanes in Florida,” he said. “We deal with fires too in Florida, but what I would say is when … Joe Biden says that he’s more worried, like in 10 years, with the climate than a nuclear war, I mean, I’m sorry, that’s just not true.”
Flanked by two oil rigs in West Texas, DeSantis vowed to withdraw the United States from global climate change pacts and end all commitments for the country to cut net greenhouse emissions to zero, while greenlighting more pipelines and allow mining and extraction of oil, gas, coal, uranium and other minerals on federal lands.
DeSantis’ energy proposal also includes a pledge to bring gas prices down to $2 by 2025, a lofty goal that would be tested by international complexities that typically drive oil prices.
Average gas prices have consistently stayed above $2 dating back to President George W. Bush’s second term, though it has dipped below that mark for brief periods under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
Gas prices have fluctuated consistently under Biden, at times reaching record highs and driving troubling inflation. Biden has tapped into the country’s strategic petroleum reserves to help alleviate prices at the pump. The reserve held 350.6 million barrels of oil, as of the week ending September 8, down nearly 300 million barrels since he took office. DeSantis’ plan calls for refilling the reserves and limiting future use to emergencies.
Located in the heart of the Permian Basin, Midland is so intertwined with its oil- and natural gas-rich economy that its motto is “Feel the Energy!” Following the event, DeSantis will stay in Texas for fundraisers in Midland, Houston and Dallas, according to a senior campaign official.
According to his plan, DeSantis would roll back subsidies for electric vehicles and “support Americans’ right to drive the cars they want.” The Biden administration earlier this year proposed new car pollution rules that could lead to electric vehicles accounting for two-thirds of new car sales by 2032. Much of Biden’s push toward electric vehicles has come through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package, the largest climate investment in US history.
DeSantis said Wednesday he would seek to eliminate the Department of Energy and would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a move first initiated under Trump but then reversed by Biden. DeSantis would also nix the Global Methane Pledge, a joint goal for reducing methane emissions reached last November by the Biden administration and the European Union.
And DeSantis would federalize a priority of his in Florida: banning government pension funds from considering factors like environmental, social and governance when making investment decisions.
Florida record
While DeSantis on the campaign trail has often pushed for more fossil fuel production across the country, in Florida, he has fought to put guardrails on energy companies to protect his state’s environment.
DeSantis on his second day as governor in 2019 signed an executive order that directed the state’s Department of Environmental Protection to “oppose all off-shore oil and gas activities off every coast in Florida and hydraulic fracturing in Florida.” He threatened he would “be raising Cain” if then-President Trump opened Florida’s coastal waters to drilling, warning that an oil spill there would have a “cascading effect” on his state’s economy. In 2020, his administration purchased 20,000 acres of Everglades wetlands to permanently protect them from oil drilling.
“I will continue to fight every day for the Everglades and Florida’s environment,” he said at the time.
DeSantis, though, has since seemed to distance himself from his environmental streak, telling reporters that “people have kind of misconstrued” what he has done in Florida and attributing his anti-drilling position to Floridians who enshrined such protections in the state constitution.
“Florida has a constitutional amendment to not have oil and gas exploration offshore,” he told CNN on Wednesday. “The view in Florida is definitely more mixed on that than it would be in, like, Louisiana or Texas. But that doesn’t mean that other states, you know, shouldn’t do it. It’s really up to them what they want to do.”
DeSantis has also faced questions from voters in Iowa – the first nominating state on the GOP calendar – about his energy record, particularly his past opposition to ethanol subsidies. As a congressman in 2017, DeSantis co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the federal renewable fuel standard, which mandates the blending of biofuels – most often corn-based ethanol – into US transportation fuel. Iowa is the country’s leading producer of corn, more than half of which is used to make ethanol for fuel.
DeSantis recently wrote an op-ed in an Iowa newspaper that did not acknowledge his sponsorship of the 2017 bill but said that, as president, his administration would “also support giving drivers additional low-cost options at the pump, including higher ethanol blends such as E30 and higher octane options, and ensure that America’s fuel economy is driven by moms in Marion, not bureaucrats in Washington.”
Trump has seized on DeSantis’ past efforts to end the renewable fuel standard as he seeks to drive a wedge between the Florida governor and Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. At the Iowa State Fair this summer, Trump’s campaign handed out flyers highlighting DeSantis’ past position on ethanol and claiming that the governor has been “fighting for years to kill every single job supported by this vital industry.”
DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin previously dismissed those attacks as “further evidence of (Trump’s) eroding support in Iowa.”
“Iowans increasingly know that Governor DeSantis is the presidential candidate who shares their values,” Griffin said.
But DeSantis has largely dodged questions from Iowans about ethanol, promising he would have more to say when he introduced his energy agenda.
Ethanol, DeSantis said in August, “will be a part of our energy policy, because it’s American made energy that’s produced, that supports American jobs.”

Biden administration launches first-of-its-kind American Climate Corps program,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/politics/american-climate-corps-biden/index.html,"Biden administration launches first-of-its-kind American Climate Corps program
President Joe Biden’s administration is launching the first-ever American Climate Corps Wednesday, the White House said, a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience.
“The American Climate Corps, just in its first year of recruitment, will put to work a new diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans doing the important task of conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy – in many cases, distributed and community based – implementing energy efficiency technologies that will cut consumer costs for the American people, and advancing environmental justice so long overdue in so many places,” White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi told reporters on a call previewing the announcement Tuesday.
The new corps will support a wide range of jobs, including restoring coastal wetlands, forest management to help fight wildfires, and building out clean energy projects.
Creating a Civilian Climate Corps has long been an ask of youth climate groups, including the Sunrise Movement.
The corps was an idea first introduced as part of “unity” campaign task forces between Biden’s 2020 campaign and representatives of former Democratic presidential contender and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – task forces that had a big hand in crafting policy Biden ultimately implemented as president.
Sunrise co-founder Varshini Prakash and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, were members of the climate task force, as well as Biden’s first White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy and current US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.
“A lot of the impetus and inspiration came from early proposals Sunrise shared on the Bernie/Biden task force,” Prakash told CNN in an interview Tuesday.
But the road to making the corps a reality was long and fraught. Initially proposed as part of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda and bill, the program was stripped out of the Inflation Reduction Act, crafted by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Prakash told CNN the idea then moved to the White House to be implemented.
RELATED: Biden’s climate law has led to 86,000 new jobs and $132 billion in investment, new report says
Prakash said the new corps is an important part of Biden’s reelection argument to young people, but added much more needs to be done to cut fossil fuel use and combat the impacts of the climate crisis.
“I think this represents a significant step forward,” Prakash said. “Young people need to see actions like this and more of it in the leadup to the 2024 election. There’s more to be done on the climate crisis.”
Five states – California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan and Washington – have already launched successful Climate Corps programs, with an additional five – Arizona, Utah, Minnesota, North Carolina and Maryland – announcing their own state programs Wednesday, Zaidi said.
Six agencies – the Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy and AmeriCorps – will sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the new program, with AmeriCorps standing up a new “American Climate Corps hub” to support the initiative, building on investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at climate resilience and conservation, an official told reporters Tuesday.
Signups for the new program launch Wednesday at whitehouse.gov/climatecorps, while the recruitment cycle will follow over the coming year, the official added."
"Horrific Libya flooding made up to 50 times more likely by planet-warming pollution, scientists find",https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/19/world/libya-floods-climate-change-impact/index.html,"Horrific Libya flooding made up to 50 times more likely by planet-warming pollution, scientists find
The deadly rainfall which caused catastrophic flooding and destruction in Libya, as well as other parts of the Mediterranean, this month was made much more likely and worse by the human-caused climate crisis, in addition to other human factors, according to a new scientific analysis.
The World Weather Attribution initiative – a team of scientists that analyze the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events – found planet-warming pollution made the deadly rainfall in Libya up to 50 times more likely to occur and 50% worse. They also found the extreme rainfall that hit Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria was made up to 10 times more likely.
Destruction from the rainfall was worsened by a tangle of other factors, including inadequate infrastructure and building in flood-prone areas, according to the analysis published Tuesday.
Extreme rainfall has swept across large parts of the Mediterranean region since the start of the month.
On September 3, Spain saw huge amounts of rain over the course of just a few hours, leading to floods which killed at least six people. Then Storm Daniel formed, causing severe flooding over four days in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria.
At least 17 people died in Greece and large stretches of farmland in the central part of the country were left under water, causing damage experts say could take years to recover from. Storm Daniel also caused at least seven deaths in Turkey and four in Bulgaria.
By far the most catastrophic impacts, however, were in Libya.
Gaining energy from the unusually warm waters of the Mediterranean, Storm Daniel dumped record amounts of rainfall in parts of the country’s northeast, leading to the collapse of two dams and resulting in a 7-meter (23-foot) wave of water slamming into the city of Derna, sweeping people and buildings into the sea.
Official estimates suggest around 4,000 people were killed, while more than 10,000 remain missing.
To understand the impact of climate change on the likelihood and intensity of this heavy rainfall, WWA scientists analyzed climate data as well as climate models, which allow them to compare today’s climate – around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels – to a world without climate change.
They found in Libya, not only did climate change make the extreme rainfall up to 50 times more likely, it also made it up to 50% more intense.
An event as severe as the one the country experienced is unusual even in today’s warmer climate, the report found, and can be expected around once in every 600 years.
For Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, climate change made the rainfall up to 10 times more likely and up to 40% heavier, the analysis found.
The kind of extreme rainfall this region experienced is likely to happen around once every 10 years, according to the report. Although for central Greece, which bore the brunt of the destruction between the three countries, it is only expected to happen around once in every 80 to 250 years.
The WWA scientists acknowledged that there remain uncertainties with the findings. It is not possible to definitively rule out the possibility the climate crisis had no impact on the floods, the report authors said. But, they added, there are “multiple reasons we can be confident that climate change did make the events more likely.”
Scientific research has long linked climate change to more intense rainfall. Studies have found that for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold around 7% more moisture.
What united many of the places the analysis focused on was the collision of the climate crisis and high levels of vulnerability, the report found. In central Greece, many communities live in flood-prone areas. In Libya, a lethal cocktail of aging, poorly-maintained infrastructure, a lack of warnings and deep political fractures turned a crisis into a humanitarian catastrophe.
“Through these events we are already seeing how climate change and human factors can combine to create compounding and cascading impacts,” Maja Vahlberg, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and a report author, said on a call with reporters.
Steps can be taken to mitigate the risk, according to the report, including better early warning systems and evacuation plans.
“Reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience to all types of extreme weather is paramount for saving lives,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College London, said in a statement.
Karsten Haustein, a climate researcher at Leipzig University in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings show how rare these extreme rainfall events would have been in a world without climate change.
It’s “a remarkable result,” he told CNN.
Jasper Knight, a geoscientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, also not involved in the study, said that the results shine a light on how climate change is affecting extreme events in the Mediterranean, a region which tends not to receive much attention.
But, he told CNN, “we also need more in-depth analysis based on longer and more accurate records.”"

Extreme heat, fires and floods threaten Europe’s economy
Mounting climate risks, illustrated by the extreme heat, wildfires and floods that ravaged parts of Europe this summer, could hurt the region’s economy as soon as this year, the European Commission warned Monday.
In its latest economic forecast, the European Union’s executive arm downgraded its predictions for growth in the region in 2023 and 2024. But even that gloomier outlook could prove too optimistic, it said.
“The materialization of these [climate] risks bears severe costs for the EU economy, in terms of losses in natural capital and deterioration of economic activity, including tourism,” the commission said.
It now expects the EU’s gross domestic product to grow 0.8% this year, down from a 1% rise forecast in the spring. Next year’s growth has been revised to 1.4% from 1.7%.
The commission blamed weak domestic demand, dampened by high inflation, as well as rising interest rates for the downgrades. But it added that there was “formidable uncertainty” over its latest forecast, with extreme weather among the “downside” risks.
No Roman holiday?
Tourism can account for as much as a fifth of annual GDP in some countries in the region. Europeans are already starting to rethink where to vacation in the future after this year’s scorching temperatures in southern Europe and the hottest summer ever recorded on the continent in 2022.
The European Travel Commission, an association of tourism organizations, said in July that the number of European tourists planning to travel to Mediterranean destinations in the summer and fall this year had dropped 10% compared with the same period in 2022. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland and Denmark, where the weather is milder, had seen a “surge in popularity,” the ETC noted.
Travelers from outside the EU may likewise lose their taste for vacations in Italy and Greece, both of which have been battling wildfires. A spokesperson at ForwardKeys, a travel data company, told CNN in July that “there has been a shift in preference towards cooler and more northern destinations” among UK travelers as a result of heat waves in continental Europe that month.
Global warming could dent tourism in another way: by accelerating the erosion of beaches and amplifying wildfires that rip through forests — both part of Europe’s “natural capital,” David Owen, chief economist at Saltmarsh Economics, told CNN.
In a study published last October, the Bank of Italy warned that rising temperatures risked stunting growth in the EU’s third-biggest economy, with tourism and agriculture most exposed.
The blistering temperatures have already been bad news for olive trees, for a second year running, with industry experts warning of skyrocketing prices and potential shortages of olive oil. In Spain, the world’s biggest olive oil producer, production has already plunged.
The full extent of the damage from this year’s heat won’t be known until after harvest time in October and November, but European olive oil production could sink by 700,000 metric tons — a fall of more than 30% — compared with its five-year average, according to Kyle Holland at market research group Mintec.
Construction and manufacturing are among other economic sectors vulnerable to extreme heat, said Owen at Saltmarsh Economics.
“If you’re having to learn to live with temperatures topping 40 degrees [Celsius] for a few days at a time in parts of southern Europe, we don’t function very well at those sorts of temperatures, so it will impact economies more generally,” he added.
Similarly to the European Commission, on Sunday the International Monetary Fund pointed to “grave risks to economic well-being” from climate change.
“G20 members must lead by example in delivering on the promises of $100 billion per year for climate finance,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at the Group of 20 summit in India.
“Countries also need to mobilize domestic resources to finance and manage the green transition through tax reforms, effective and efficient public spending, strong fiscal institutions, and deep local debt markets.”

Island states seek climate protection from Law of the Sea,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/asia/pacific-islands-international-tribunal-hearing-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Island states seek climate protection from Law of the Sea
The prime ministers of two small island nations that face ongoing impacts from rising sea levels will appear at legal hearings at an international court in Hamburg, Germany, on Monday, and seek an advisory opinion on the obligations of countries to combat climate change.
Prime Ministers Kausea Natano of Tuvalu and Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda will give evidence at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which will consider whether carbon emissions absorbed by the ocean should be considered marine pollution, and what obligations nations have to protect the marine environment.
The tribunal will issue an advisory opinion, which is not legally binding, but offers an authoritative statement on legal matters that could guide countries as they craft climate protection law.
The prime ministers, representing the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS), will argue that countries have an obligation to protect the marine environment under the UN convention on the Law of the Sea, including from greenhouse gas emissions.
“We come here seeking urgent help, in the strong belief that international law is an essential mechanism for correcting the manifest injustice that our people are suffering as a result of climate change,” said Tuvalu’s Natano.
Excessive carbon pollution results in damage to the oceans, including coral bleaching and acidification.
Low-lying island states like Tuvalu and Vanuatu are also at risk of becoming submerged by water by the end of the century due to slow-onset climate impacts.
Small island nations have also sought legal clarity on nations’ climate obligations in other courts. Vanuatu led a campaign to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to issue an advisory opinion on countries’ obligations to address climate change.
The UN General Assembly in March voted to refer the case to the ICJ, which will issue an opinion in 2024."
"World isn’t moving fast enough to cut pollution and keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius, UN scorecard says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/08/us/un-scorecard-climate-cop28/index.html,"World isn’t moving fast enough to cut pollution and keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius, UN scorecard says
In the eight years since the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, the world’s nations have not done enough to cut pollution and avert catastrophic levels of warming, according to the first United Nations scorecard since Paris, released on Friday.
As the world’s nations gather for COP28 in Dubai in late November to measure how much progress has been made on bringing down global emissions since Paris, Friday’s assessment by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change shows the world is still seriously off-track.
One of the key facets of COP28 will be what’s known as a “global stocktake,” measuring how quickly the world’s nations are meeting the emissions goals set out in Paris, to help bring down the temperature of a rapidly warming globe.
The report warns there “is a rapidly narrowing window to raise ambition and implement existing commitments,” but the world is currently not in line with the temperature targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally below the critical warming threshold of 1.5 degrees.
The planet has already warmed about 1.2 degrees above preindustrial levels; during this year’s summer of record heat, it hit 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels.
This year’s sweltering summer broke global temperature records. June to August was the planet’s warmest such period since records began in 1940, according to data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
While the UN report finds the Paris Agreement “has driven near-universal climate action” from each country and put a major focus on lowering emissions, the actions themselves from countries aren’t matching up to the crisis.
“Against forecasts made prior to its adoption, the Paris Agreement has led to contributions that significantly reduce forecasts of future warming, yet the world is not on track to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement,” the UN authors wrote.
In a statement, COP28 president designate Dr. Sultan Al Jaber called on governments and businesses to deliver “real and actionable commitments to address climate change.”
“Today’s global stocktake provides clear direction on how we can meet the expectations of the Paris Agreement by taking decisive action in this critical decade,” Al Jaber said in the statement.
Experts said COP28 represents a pivotal moment for the globe to collectively rise to the occasion, as climate-driven extreme weather and deadly heat has battered countries all over the world.
The UN report is “a call for radical and immediate action,” Tom Evans, policy adviser on climate diplomacy and geopolitics at think tank E3G, said in a statement. “Agreeing on a global rapid response plan at COP28 can turn the tide on climate action.”
Evans called for countries to scale up renewable energy and phase out fossil fuels. But getting the world’s nations to agree on language phasing out all fossil fuels has proved extremely difficult in the past and could run into challenges at this year’s summit – hosted by oil and gas-rich nation the United Arab Emirates."
"$23 billion pledged at Africa Climate Summit, but leaders warn of need ‘to act with urgency’",https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/africa/billions-pledged-at-africa-climate-summit-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"$23 billion pledged at Africa Climate Summit, but leaders warn of need ‘to act with urgency’
Follow:
The inaugural Africa Climate Summit drew to a close on Wednesday, with the host, Kenya’s president William Ruto, saying that a total of $23 billion had been pledged to green projects by governments, investors, development banks and philanthropists.
The summit, which focussed on driving green growth and climate finance solutions, concluded with the “Nairobi Declaration,” a call from African leaders for urgent action on climate change, which included a request for new global taxes on carbon pollution as well as phasing out coal use and ending fossil fuel subsidies.
African heads of state and government warned that many African countries face “disproportionate burdens and risks” from climate change, and called on the global community “to act with urgency” in reducing planet-heating pollution and supporting the continent in addressing the problem.
“Africa is not historically responsible for global warming, but bears the brunt of its effect, impacting lives, livelihoods, and economies,” the leaders said in the joint declaration.
Among the most eye-catching finance announcements, the United Arab Emirates pledged $4.5 billion to clean energy initiatives in Africa. The pledge was announced by Sultan Al-Jaber, the head of the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, and the government-owned renewable energy company, Masdar. He will also serve as the president of COP28, the annual UN climate meeting that will take place in Dubai starting in November.
“It is our ambition that this will launch a new transformative partnership to jumpstart a pipeline of bankable clean energy projects in this important continent,” Al-Jaber said, adding that the investment could lead to the generation of 15 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030. Africa’s current clean energy generation capacity is 56 gigawatts.
The initiative marks a positive development, according to Yemi Osinbajo, former vice president of Nigeria and now an advisor for the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), a consortium that helps developing countries shift to clean energy.
“It reflects a commitment to addressing the pressing issue of climate change by investing in renewable and sustainable energy solutions in Africa, which is essential for reducing emissions, creating jobs and driving social and economic development,” he told CNN.
Germany announced 450 million euros (about $481 million) of climate finance pledges, and and the US pledged $30 million to support climate resilient food security efforts across Africa. Hundreds of millions more were offered following an initiative to boost Africa’s carbon credit production 19-fold by 2030.
Carbon credits are used by companies to offset carbon emissions, and are usually generated by financing projects that aim to reduce carbon pollution in the atmosphere, such as tree planting, or reduce planet-heating pollution by promoting switching to renewable energy, especially in developing countries.
“Carbon credits could be a game-changer for Africa,” said Osinbajo. “They have the potential to unlock billions for the climate finance needs of African economies while expanding energy access, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and driving climate action.”
However, campaigners in Nairobi protested against this approach, arguing that carbon credits are flawed and allow wealthy countries and companies to continue to pollute.
A new framing
In the joint declaration, African leaders called upon the global community “to act with urgency in reducing emissions, fulfilling its obligations, keeping past promises, and supporting the continent in addressing climate change.”
They pointed to steps to achieve this, including accelerating efforts to reduce emissions, honoring the commitment to provide $100 billion in annual climate finance as promised at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, and upholding commitments to “a fair and accelerated process of phasing down coal, and abolishment of all fossil fuel subsidies.”
“Decarbonizing the global economy is also an opportunity to contribute to equality and shared prosperity,” the leaders said.
According to Osinbajo, the summit provided a “new framing” of Africa, not as victim, but as a key solution to the climate crisis. He said that “with its untapped renewable energy potential, the world’s youngest and fastest growing workforce, and critical minerals and resources, (Africa) has the fundamentals to become a cost-competitive green industrial hub, greening both African and global consumption and removing carbon from the air.”"
Planet-warming pollution made summer heat twice as likely for nearly all of humanity,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/world/summer-heat-three-times-more-likely-climate-change/index.html,"Planet-warming pollution made summer heat twice as likely for nearly all of humanity
During this summer of dangerous, record-shattering heat almost no one on Earth escaped climate change-fueled temperatures, a new analysis has found.
Researchers from climate research group Climate Central mapped the influence of climate change on temperatures in more than 200 countries and territories.
They found that between June and August, 98% of the global population — 7.95 billion people — experienced high temperatures made at least twice as likely by climate change.
“In every country we could analyze, including the Southern Hemisphere where this is the coolest time of year, we saw temperatures that would be difficult — and in some cases nearly impossible — without human-caused climate change,” Andrew Pershing, lead author of the report and vice president of science for Climate Central, said in a statement.
Nearly half of humanity, around 3.9 billion people, experienced 30 days or more of heat made at least three times more likely by planet-warming pollution, according to the report. This included the US states of Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and Florida.
But the impacts were much starker in poorer countries.
Those that produce the lowest amounts of planet-heating pollution experienced between three to four times more summer days “with very strong climate fingerprints” than the world’s largest economies, the report found.
The report findings help show the impacts of climate change on human lives, Pershing told CNN.
“There has always been a big gap between the global statistics that scientists use to track climate change and the daily experience of people around the world,” he said.
One of the big lessons from this summer is that there’s nowhere to hide from the heat, he added.
“There’s no break and there’s no escape. You look around, there really is not a place in the world that is safe from climate change. I think we’d all like to imagine that we could move somewhere and everything would be great, but every place is feeling that impact.”
The report comes on the heels of new data released Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service which found that this summer was the planet’s hottest on record by a significant margin.
June, July and August all broke global records for the hottest such months.
Both July and August were 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, according Copernicus — marking the breach, albeit temporary, of a key threshold scientists have long warned the world must stay under to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
While scientists are more focused on long-term global temperature trends, these temporary breaches provide an alarming preview of what the world can expect summers to be like at 1.5 degrees of warming.
Humanity’s exposure to heat will only increase unless planet-warming pollution is cut to zero, Pershing said.
“While this summer is shocking, it isn’t surprising. We knew it was coming. And we know that as long as we keep burning coal, oil, and natural gas, our chance of encountering unusually hot conditions will continue to grow.”

These five cities could be one natural disaster away from a catastrophic water crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/02/us/water-infrastructure-failure-us-cities-climate/index.html,"These five cities could be one natural disaster away from a catastrophic water crisis
When torrential rainfall in August 2022 pushed the Pearl River in Mississippi to surge well beyond its banks, floodwaters spilled into the suburbs of Jackson and led an already-hobbled water treatment plant to fail.
It was the final stroke in what experts described as a yearslong issue in the making, which eventually left tens of thousands of residents in the city without clean drinking water for weeks.
What happened in Jackson, experts say, is a bellwether for what’s to come if America continues to kick the can down the road in addressing its aging and crumbling water infrastructure. The climate crisis threatens to make those issues even more pressing.
When sea levels rise, summers become hotter or heavy rains lead to more flooding, the country’s water infrastructure – largely built last century and only designed to last roughly 75 years – will be more strained than ever, threatening a system vital to human life.
At the rate our climate is changing, America’s water infrastructure is not equipped to handle the challenges to come, said Erik Olson, the senior strategic director for health and food with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
“America’s water system relies on last century’s infrastructure that often can’t protect our health from hazardous contaminants,” Olson told CNN. “And our outdated system is completely unprepared for this century’s challenges of intense heat, drought and flooding.”
The American Society of Civil Engineers gave America’s drinking water infrastructure a C-minus in its 2021 report card. And climate change-fueled extreme weather disasters promises a gauntlet of even tougher tests.
The 2021 infrastructure legislation signed by President Joe Biden includes about $30 billion for drinking water, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act another $550 million for water infrastructure. But experts say those figures are not enough to make up for decades of disinvestment and mismanagement across the country.
In Jackson alone, it could cost $1 billion to $2 billion to repair the water system, and the water industry estimates that the total nationwide costs will top $1 trillion. “Federal investments account for just a few percent of the total needs,” Olson said.
To better understand the issue, CNN examined five cities or regions across the country that show signs of vulnerability under a rapidly warming planet – from coastal flooding in New York to saltwater intrusion in California’s groundwater.
Buffalo, New York
Buffalo water officials don’t have to wonder too hard about its worst-case scenario. It basically happened last year.
A devastating winter storm dropped more than 50 inches of snow on the city in December, knocking out power, making roads impassable and killing 46 people in the area.
The high winds from the storm generated a phenomenon known as a “seiche,” in which water from the west end of Lake Erie near Toledo was pushed east, creating high water levels and coastal flooding in Buffalo.
The blizzard and seiche flooding threatened to knock out power to Buffalo’s water treatment plant, located precariously along Lake Erie. Thankfully, the plant has multiple backup sources, and the plant employees toughed out the storm, keeping the plant online and delivered clean water to residents. But Oluwole “OJ” McFoy, the general manager of the Buffalo Sewer Water Authority, said it was a “nightmare scenario” for the city and a warning of how rising water levels could impact its water infrastructure.
“(If) we don’t have power, we can’t do anything. And we’ve seen those high winds, especially those associated with many of these high lake levels, knock out power, and we’ve had to use our backup power as well,” he said. “Everything for us is just about being resilient, but those things cost money, and you have to make sure that as part of your capital expenditure that you’re building that resiliency into your system.”
The non-profit organization Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper has teamed up with the city on a study of the city’s coastal resiliency. Climate change has made the flooding issues worse in recent years, as the average water level has risen and the lake no longer completely freezes over in winter.
“That perfect storm – flooding, coastal storms, lack of ice coverage, fluctuating lake levels, erosion – all of that is being exacerbated from the effects of climate change,” said Kerrie Gallo, the deputy executive director of Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper.
Prichard, Alabama
The Gulf Coast is no stranger to devastating storms. But in Gulf cities that aren’t as populous or well-invested in, a hurricane could trigger a water infrastructure crisis.
Residents of Prichard, Alabama, believe their city – a less than 10-minute drive from Mobile – could be “the next Jackson,” said Carletta Davis, president of the non-profit We Matter Eight Mile Community Association. From intensifying storms to leaking water lines that are never addressed, as well as racial injustice, the issues they face are multifold, she said.
Prichard’s infrastructure on average leaked 56% of the water coming in from reservoirs each month from April 2021 through November 2022, according to a report from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
“This water system has completely failed,” Davis told CNN.
“Hurricanes are one of our biggest threats, along with heavy rainfall, coastal erosion and flooding,” she said. “And when it rains, we have sewage overflows, buses can’t even get kids from school to their homes, and the streets are completely impassable.”
Prichard is a predominantly Black and low-income city, and the historical legacy of disinvestment and racial injustice remains baked into the decisions made for the city’s residents, including repairing and upgrading its water systems, said Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice.
“The problem we are seeing in Prichard is similar to the issues we see plaguing communities around the country,” Flowers told CNN. “Failing water and sanitation infrastructure that hasn’t been repaired in decades due to lack of funding and discriminatory distribution of public funds have led to issues that can spread diseases and threaten public health.”
The impacts and financial burden of Prichard’s failing and aging infrastructure then gets passed on to the residents in these communities, she added. Ramsey Sprague, president of the Mobile Environmental Justice Action Coalition, said it’s just a matter of time until another storm hits the Gulf and shuts Prichard’s entire water system down.
“We’re staring down the barrel of a gun,” Sprague said. “With these infrastructure challenges in cities like Prichard, there are whole populations that are teetering on the brink of total collapse that can’t be easily addressed.”
As of August, after years of calling on city leaders to solve their escalating problem, Prichard’s water utility board began the process of eminent domain – condemning residents from their homes so they can work to fix the water system. It’s a move residents and community advocates are fighting.
St. Louis, Missouri
Lead pipes were commonly used in water systems across the US until they were outlawed in 1986 due to the danger of lead poisoning.
But in cities like St. Louis, which has seen a stark population decline since its heyday in the mid-20th century, some of these older lead pipes remain and have the potential to leech the toxic chemical into the water supply.
Even low levels of lead exposure are dangerous for children and can damage the blood cells and nervous system or cause other disabilities. The Environmental Protection Agency has called lead poisoning the “number one environmental health threat in the US for children ages 6 and younger.”
The state of Missouri is fourth in the nation in terms of lead service lines per capita, according to data from the NRDC.
St. Louis has tried to remove these lines – but doesn’t know for sure where they all are.
“Just because St. Louis is an older city and it was a very commonly used plumbing material, especially for the smaller lead service lines from the water mains into people’s homes, they were just very widely used,” said Rachel Rimmerman, the director of business and outreach at the Water Access, Technology, Environment and Resources Institute at Saint Louis University. “It also wasn’t very common practice to have an inventory of where those lines are.”
Furthering the problem, climate change has led to more intense flooding and storms, and that has the potential to damage older, weaker water systems like in St. Louis, said Jason Knouft, a biology professor at Saint Louis University studying the impact of climate change.
“These things were constructed based on a smaller population and less intense storm events, and so as we move forward … it’s a broader problem with our water infrastructure,” he said.
The issue has not gone unheeded. The massive 2021 infrastructure law includes $15 billion for lead service line replacement, according to the EPA.
Central Coast, California
Roughly an hour from California’s Bay Area and less than a mile from the Pacific Ocean, Kelli and Tim Hutton purchased a half an acre property in the Central Coast town of Moss Landing last summer.
As with many others living in the area, they heavily rely on their private well for water.
After moving into the new home with their newborn baby, the Huttons heard other residents were concerned about high levels of saltwater intrusion, being so near the ocean. Rising sea level and California’s whiplash weather have been impacting their water table, with seawater seeping in and causing pipes to corrode, making water undrinkable.
The threat of saltwater intrusion increases during a drought, which California is facing more of under a worsening climate crisis. When water supply is low, groundwater is over-pumped from coastal aquifers, disrupting the balance between inland freshwater and ocean water. As groundwater levels drop, saltwater seeps in and fills in the gaps in the soil where freshwater used to be.
It’s not just drought. Storm surge and floods can also push saltwater far inland, according to the US Department of Agriculture. And with climate change increasing the potential for weather whiplash, dramatic shifts in periods of drought and high precipitation, in California, saltwater intrusion is becoming an increasing threat for people living along the coast like the Huttons.
“We really need to be proactive about finding ways to conserve our water as far as we’re using it, whether that’s recycled water purposes or drip irrigation,” Tim said. “If we don’t take care of it now, it’s only a resource that’s going to be with us for so long. If our table starts drying up, then we’re going to be out of luck.”
This part of the Central Coast is also surrounded by farms that have been using decades’ worth of fertilizers which turn into toxic chemicals. For the Huttons, water quality tests show their private well actually contained nitrate levels five times the government’s safe level for drinking.
“It’s been pretty uncomfortable and kind of nerve-wracking, especially when it’s like bath time and babies open their mouths when they’re in the water,” Kelli told CNN.
San Juan, Puerto Rico
Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico in 2017, leaving much of the island territory without power for month. And because Puerto Rico’s water infrastructure relies heavily on the electric grid to operate, many residents were left without running water in their homes for just as long.
It gave a glimpse of how frail Puerto Rico’s water system can be during an extreme weather disaster. But what makes the infrastructure even more vulnerable is its lifespan and disrepair, said Félix I. Aponte-Ortiz, an urban environmental planner and retired professor at the University of Puerto Rico.
“The transmission is fragile, and it’s very subject to hurricane and huge precipitation,” Aponte-Ortiz told CNN. “Every time we have a hurricane or a tropical storm, we have a problem with the electric system. The potable water system is the same; they’re very old.”
Estimates show that 60% of the city’s water mains in San Juan – which sources its water from both reservoirs and groundwater aquifers – are over 50 years old, according to a 2019 report by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. These older pipes are more likely to leak and break, which could trigger water shortages as well as water quality problems.
The Natural Resources Defense Council along with local groups released a report in 2017 that found nearly all of Puerto Rico’s residents were drinking water from systems that violated the Safe Drinking Water Act, and that almost 70% of people on the island were served by water sources that violated the policy’s health standards – the highest of any state or territory, NRDC’s Olson said.
Water repairs and upgrades have always been costly across the country. But in Puerto Rico, every extreme weather event compounds the burden of the historical legacy of federal disinvestment in US territories, making repairs an even greater struggle."
Scientists say they’ve found a direct link between planet-warming pollution and polar bear survival,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/01/world/polar-bear-greenhouse-gas-emissions-intl-scli-climate-scn/index.html,"Scientists say they’ve found a direct link between planet-warming pollution and polar bear survival
Scientists say they have found a link between human-related greenhouse gas emissions and polar bear reproduction and survival rates for the first time in a new study, potentially overcoming a barrier to protecting the species.
Polar bears live in 19 populations across the Arctic and are found in Canada, the United States, Russia, Greenland and Norway, according to conservation organization Polar Bears International.
The populations live under distinct and varying circumstances, but all depend upon ice sheets to access their main prey, two species of seal, said study coauthor Steven Amstrup, chief scientist emeritus at Polar Bears International.
When sea ice melts, polar bears are forced onto land where they are deprived of food and must survive on fat reserves that they have accumulated beforehand.
Climate change caused by human activity is accelerating sea ice loss, giving polar bears less time to feed and build up their fat reserves, and more days where they are forced to go without food. This leads ultimately to a decline in their population.
Researchers from Polar Bears International, the University of Washington and the University of Wyoming have quantified the connection between the number of ice-free days a population of polar bears has to endure and the amount of planet-warming pollution released into the atmosphere, as well as corresponding polar bear survival rates in some populations, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Polar bears were listed as “threatened” due to human-caused climate warming under the US Endangered Species Act, or ESA, in 2008. But the US Department of Interior said at the time that, because threat to a particular species couldn’t be directly linked to a specific source of greenhouse gases, federal agencies don’t have to consider emissions when approving projects.
The researchers said the new study provides evidence of that direct link.
Impact of emissions
Researchers looked at polar bear subpopulations that had experienced at least 10 years with ice-free seasons from 1979 — when satellite imagery of sea ice first became available — to 2020.
They found that the number of days polar bears were forced to go without food increased as greenhouse gas emissions accumulated.
For example, polar bears in the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic Ocean were forced to go without food for about 12 days in 1979. It increased to about 137 days in 2020, with another day of fasting being added for every 14 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere.
Subpopulations in areas where ice sheets would typically melt entirely during the summer — such as in Hudson Bay — saw slower increases in the days they were forced to go without food over time, compared with subpopulations in areas where ice sheets would usually remain during the summer, such as in the South Beaufort Sea.
Bears in areas where ice sheets used to persist for longer in the summer are now experiencing “a sudden shift” in their environment, requiring a significant adjustment where they are having forced fast days that they did not have before, Amstrup told CNN.
A 2020 study that Amstrup was involved in found that the number of days a bear can survive without food varies by region and the condition of the animal, but the more ice-free days experienced, the steeper the decline in reproduction and survival.
The researchers behind the new study combined the relationship they found between the number of forced fast days polar bears had to endure and cumulative greenhouse gas emissions with the connection found in 2020 between the number of forced fast days and declining survival rates. That allowed them to calculate the impact of cumulative emissions on the rate of polar bear survival.
“When the (Department of the Interior) memo was written in 2008, we could not say how greenhouse gas emissions equated to a decline in polar bear populations. But within a few years we could directly relate the quantity of emissions to climate warming and later to Arctic sea ice loss as well,” said study coauthor Cecilia Bitz, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, in the news release. “Our study shows that not only sea ice, but polar bear survival, can be directly related to greenhouse gas emissions.”
For example, the study noted that each of the hundreds of power plants in the US might make a relatively small contribution to emissions, but collectively the power plants emit nearly 2 gigatons of greenhouse gases each year. This would be about 60-plus gigatons over the 30-plus year life span of a polar bear in the southern Beaufort Sea.
In this subpopulation, bears endure an extra forced fasting day for every 23 gigatons of emissions added to the atmosphere, so their survival rate would be reduced by about 4% by the power plant emissions over that period, according to the study.
The US Department of the Interior declined to comment on the findings.
Applications for other species
Kirsten Zickfeld, distinguished professor of climate science at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said the new research shows a shift in what’s possible when it comes to demonstrating the effects of climate change.
“Previous research showed that the more carbon dioxide we produce from human activities, the more our climate changes. The new study by Amstrup and Bitz takes this idea further by showing that this direct link also applies to ecosystem impacts,” said Zickfeld, who was not involved in the study. “They found that when we emit more carbon dioxide, it directly affects how many polar bear cubs can survive. This finding allows us to connect the decline in polar bear populations to individual sources of carbon emissions.”
Amstrup said he hopes the study can be used as a template by other researchers to get other species affected by human-caused climate change protected by the ESA."
Cities are hotter than ever. Here are 5 things they can do about it,https://www.cnn.com/style/cities-heat-design-dfi/index.html,"Cities are hotter than ever. Here are 5 things they can do about it
Follow:
Editor’s Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting architectural solutions for communities displaced by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.
It’s been another hellish summer. A double whammy of the human-caused climate crisis and the arrival of El Niño has fueled soaring temperatures that have made this year downright deadly. July 2023 has been declared the world’s hottest month on record. In a recent address, UN Secretary-General António Guterres ominously described this year as the dawning of “the era of global boiling.”
In Europe, over 60,000 people died last year from heat-related illnesses, with some countries adopting a naming system for heat waves akin to those used for hurricanes and typhoons. The Italian Meteorological Society, for instance, named a recent heatwave “Cerberus,” after the three-headed hound guarding the gates of hell in Dante’s “Inferno.”
Problems are especially acute in densely populated cities where the “urban heat island effect” can result in microclimates about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than surrounding areas. The phenomenon, first documented in the 1800s by an amateur meteorologist in London, occurs in areas with high concentrations of heat-absorbing concrete buildings, asphalt surfaces and a dearth of green spaces.
Despite knowing about the perils of global warming for decades, many cities are proving to be woefully unprepared. Now, local officials are appointing “chief heat officers” to expedite “heat action plans,” while start-ups race to invent better air conditioners and personal cooling devices.
Many solutions are based on time-tested design principles. Here are five things cities are doing right now to combat rising temperatures:
Planting trees and green spaces
A healthy canopy of trees is among the most effective and egalitarian defenses against the urban heat island effect. Seeking refuge beneath a tree can feel 11 to 25 degrees Celsius (20 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler compared to standing in direct sunlight, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Apart from the instant relief of shade, a process called “evapotranspiration,” where water transfers from plants and soil into the atmosphere, also helps cool surrounding areas by up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit).
Barcelona, which has become something of a laboratory for progressive urban interventions, may soon offer a vital case study on the efficacy of trees. Per its “Tree Master Plan,” the Spanish city aims to blanket 30% of its land with a variety of climate-resilient species by 2037. Today, holm oaks, Aleppo pines, plane trees, cypresses and other hardy species already line the city’s streets and new “superilla,” or superblocks, which are essentially reclaimed roads that have been turned into tree-lined public plazas. Only a handful of the planned 503 superblocks were completed in time for this grueling Spanish summer, though the city plans to finish them all by the end of the decade.
Spraying mist
In Chinese cities including Wuhan and Chongqing, where temperatures exceeded 113 degrees Fahrenheit last year, cooling sprays can be found in malls, parks and bus stops. The sprays are sometimes complemented by fleets of “mist cannons” — essentially utility trucks equipped with high-pressure water sprayers (pictured above) — that have been roving big cities in China since 2014, according to the environmental think tank China Dialogue.
Although these cannons were initially introduced to tackle air pollution, a recent study from Seoul National University suggests that spraying fine water particles can lower ambient temperatures by as much as 7%, especially if misters are positioned at optimal angles.
Austria’s capital Vienna has meanwhile designated 22 areas as “cool straßen” (“cool streets”) equipped with drinking fountains, mist showers and smart sprinkler systems that automatically activate when temperatures rise above 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit).
Rolling out the awnings
An awning is a simple and inexpensive weather shield that’s fallen out of fashion due to contemporary architecture’s penchant for sleek facades. But as cities become desperate for quick answers to unrelenting heat, canopies may be coming back in style.
The Spanish city of Seville (sometimes known as “the Iberian oven”) has recently expanded its network of large canvas awnings to shield more transit stations, playgrounds, schools and hospitals.
In Tel Aviv, Israel, a series of canopies made with LumiWeave, a “smart” cloth  embedded with solar cells, has been installed in the city’s business district. Developed by Israeli product designer Anai Green, the awnings store solar energy during the daytime that is then used to power LED lights woven into the material.
Painting roofs and pavements white
As residents of Greek islands can attest, painting rooftops and buildings white is an easy and relatively inexpensive defense against hot summers. Benefiting from something called the “albedo effect,” a structure with a clean white roof reflects around 85% of direct sunlight compared to a dark roof, which reflects only about 20%.
Now, a research team at Indiana’s Purdue University claims to have developed a type of “ultra-white” paint that can reflect 98% of sunlight and lower a building’s surface temperature compared to its surroundings by nearly 20 degrees Fahrenheit at night (or by 8 degrees Fahrenheit during strong sunlight).
Covering a roof area of around 1,000 square feet in this paint would produce the equivalent of 10 kilowatts of “cooling power,” said Xiulin Ruan, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue, in a press statement. “That’s more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses.”
Floating architecture isn’t the future. It’s already here
In Los Angeles, the city’s Bureau of Street Services has in recent years been painting roads in a reflective white-gray coating called CoolSeal. In 2019, after a 10- to 15- degree Fahrenheit cooling effect was recorded in pilot areas, LA’s then-mayor Eric Garcetti announced a plan to cover 250 miles of road lanes with cooling material by 2028 — an initiative that will cost the city an estimated $40,000 per mile, according to journal published by the Royal Institute of British Architects.
But white isn’t the only cooling pigment. A pilot project in LA’s Pacoima neighborhood is testing the efficacy of street coatings that come in a variety of colors. According to the manufacturer, StreetBond, the acrylic-based colorant is designed to reduce urban heat island effect by at least 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
But as cities invest in solar reflective coatings, a 2020 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters threw cold water on the strategy by suggesting that while reflective sidewalks do result in cooler surface temperatures, humans in these spaces may actually feel warmer because they end up absorbing the heat. “Solar reflective coatings are not a policy panacea for urban heat problems,” the authors wrote, adding that municipalities “need to consider when and how people use land to decide which heat metric (air, surface, or radiant temperature) should be prioritized.”
Returning to local materials and traditional building techniques
A growing cadre of architects and urbanists are eschewing Western architectural traditions by embracing the natural ventilation, traditional construction techniques and materials like insulating mud bricks that have been used for millennia by those living in hot climates.
Pritzker Prize-winning architect Francis Kéré, for instance, creates a sense of airiness through his inventive use of clay, laterite stones, eucalyptus branches and dead wood. School buildings Kéré designed in his native Burkina Faso show how to build comfortable and convivial spaces in extremely hot weather — without the need for AC.
In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Auroville Earth Institute has become a locus of this burgeoning “vernacular” architecture movement. Over nearly four decades, the research center has been collaborating with architects and builders around the world interested learning how to build economical and low-carbon structures from compressed mud and soil. Compared to concrete, glass and steel, traditional earth bricks absorb more heat and humidity.
Would you live in a cave? These architects believe we should
Indian architect Anupama Kundoo, who has built several structures in Auroville, is known for beautiful, climate-resilient buildings made “with materials sourced on the spot,” as she has described her work. Speaking at last year’s The World Around Summit in the Netherlands, Kundoo made a compelling case for recognizing the unique qualities of a area’s geography — and building with whatever is abundant there.
“If you look at pre-industrial architecture, we built with any material,” she explained. “If there was mud, we used mud; if there was wood, we used wood; if it’s a desert and there’s no wood, you build domes; if there’s ice, you use ice.”
“There is a deep, deep relationship between what you produce and where you use it,” she added.

"As young conservatives try to get climate on the agenda in 2024, denial takes the spotlight instead",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/politics/climate-change-republican-debate-ramaswamy/index.html,"As young conservatives try to get climate on the agenda in 2024, denial takes the spotlight instead
During this week’s Republican primary debate on Fox News, a young voter notably asked about the climate crisis: How would these presidential candidates assuage concerns that the Republican Party “doesn’t care” about the issue?
The question was all but unavoidable after weeks of extreme, deadly weather. Global temperature records have been shattered, extreme heat has soared off-the-charts in the US and the Maui wildfire death toll continues to climb.
What followed the question was one of the night’s most chaotic exchanges, demonstrating the challenge some conservatives face in getting climate policy on the 2024 GOP agenda, even as extreme weather takes its toll on millions of people across the country.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the leader of a state that has been thrashed by deadly extreme weather in recent years, refused the moderators’ show-of-hands question on whether climate change is caused by humans. He used the moment to deride the media and President Joe Biden’s response in Maui.
Then 38-year-old Vivek Ramaswamy – notably the youngest candidate on stage – called the “climate change agenda” a “hoax,” an answer that elicited intense boos from the audience.
A majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – 55% – say human activity is causing changes to the world’s climate, according to a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. It also found a majority of Americans and Republicans say their area has been impacted by extreme heat in the past five years.
But connecting the dots between climate and extreme weather is proving a more partisan issue. The poll found there are deep divides between Republicans and Democrats on the question of whether human-caused climate change is contributing to extreme weather: just 35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they think climate change is a major factor in extremely hot days, compared with 85% of those who lean Democrat.
After the debate, a prominent conservative climate group said Ramaswamy tried to clarify his position.
“He came to our after-party and he blatantly told us that he believes climate change is real,” Benji Backer, founder of the American Conservation Coalition, told CNN. “So, he changed his position again.”
Asked by CNN on Friday whether he believes climate change is real, Ramaswamy responded, “Climate change has existed as long as the Earth has existed. Manmade climate change has existed as long as man has existed on the earth.” In an email, Ramaswamy’s campaign spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN the candidate does believe climate change is real, but policies to address it “have little to do with climate change and more to do with penalizing the West as a way to achieve global ‘equity.’”
Yet for Republicans working to make climate policy more mainstream in the GOP, Ramaswamy’s language at the debate echoed a climate crisis-denying candidate who wasn’t onstage, former President Donald Trump. Trump has called climate change itself a “hoax” and falsely claimed wind turbines cause cancer.
“The fact that he chose the word hoax, to me, he’s emulating what President Trump had said before,” Heather Reams, president of conservative nonprofit Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, told CNN. Reams, who was sitting in the audience in Milwaukee, noted that Ramaswamy calling the “climate change agenda” a hoax didn’t go over well in a room full of Republicans.
“The whole place booed him, so it wasn’t well received,” Reams said. “Hearing booing was actually heartening to hear that the party is really moving on, they’re seeing the economic opportunities that can be had for the United States being a leader in lowering emissions.”
Ramaswamy’s response was an attempt to go after the older GOP voting base in the primary, Backer said. It’s the kind of audience that Fox News has historically played to when it hosts climate deniers on some of its shows or casts doubt on the connection between extreme weather and the climate crisis – but Backer said the fact the network even asked this question “just shows that the pendulum is shifting.”
Backer warned Ramasway’s response to the question risks alienating younger conservative voters who are increasingly concerned about climate impacts.
“I’ve in two presidential elections and I’ve never voted for a Republican president in my life, because I don’t vote for climate deniers,” Backer said, adding that climate denial “is the way of the past.”
Several Republican presidential candidates have said they believe climate change is real and caused by human activity – a shift from previous elections.
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley acknowledged its reality but said foreign nations, including India and China, bear larger responsibility for addressing it. Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have all engaged frequently with conservative groups, Reams and Backer said.
“I think that Nikki Haley provided a very clear, very positive response,” Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of the American Conservation Coalition, told CNN. “We need to see more responses like that in the Republican Party. I think it’s important that we show the conservative environmental movement is here to stay.”
Backer warned that Ramaswamy and other candidates risk losing young voters if they continue to engage in climate denial – or anything that sounds remotely like it.
“There’s a lot of Republicans leading on this, but the narrative is that we don’t care,” Backer said. “And if we nominate another person who doesn’t care, young people are not going to forget that. There’s not going to be a lot of baby boomers in 20 years, so you better start thinking about the next generation.”

Tropical system forms that could threaten the Gulf Coast and Florida next week,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/weather/tropical-depression-storm-gulf-climate/index.html,"Tropical system forms that could threaten the Gulf Coast and Florida next week
Tropical Depression Ten has formed near the Yucatan Peninsula in the western Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center, and it could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon that would make landfall in Florida as early as Wednesday.
A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Yucatan in Mexico from Tulum to Rio Lagartos, including Cozumel. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for the western tip of Cuba in the provinces of Pinar Del Rio and the Isle of Youth.
The system is developing as what was Tropical Storm Franklin has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane in the Atlantic.
The depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Sunday as it meanders in the Yucatan Channel. By Monday, the system will begin moving north, entering the Gulf of Mexico.
The storm is expected to further strengthen on Monday and Tuesday as the system crosses the Gulf, moving towards Florida. The official track calls for the storm to become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and make landfall along the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
The forecast cone stretches from Tampa Bay to Panama City, and the NHC notes that “that there is significant uncertainty in 3-4 day intensity predictions and [the public] are urged to monitor changes to future forecasts.”
The next storm name on the Atlantic’s list is Idalia (pronounced ee-DAL-ya).
Who should pay attention? Anyone living in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba and the northern Gulf and Florida coast should monitor the forecast in the coming days. The direction and strength of the upper-level steering winds around this system will dictate where it will move and how quickly.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency for 33 counties ahead of the potential inclement weather. “The Governor and the Florida Division of Emergency Management are taking timely precautions to ensure Florida’s communities, infrastructure and resources are prepared, including those communities that are still recovering following Hurricane Ian,” reads a news release announcing the executive order.
When could it affect the US? The depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Sunday as it moves through the Yucatan Channel. By Monday, the system will likely enter the Gulf of Mexico, and move towards Florida. It could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon and hit the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
How strong could it get? It’s still too soon to tell how strong this system could get – or how fast it could strengthen. But it will be tracking through the warmest waters in the entire Atlantic basin – a vast source of energy for a developing storm. Exceptionally warm water can provide storms the fuel needed to strengthen and sometimes undergo rapid intensification.
Sea surface temperatures are record warm in the Gulf of Mexico and extremely high across the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Water temperatures need to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit to sustain tropical development, and portions of the Caribbean and Gulf are well above that threshold.
A hurdle to development: Warm water isn’t the only factor at play. This tropical system would also need upper-level winds to cooperate. High wind shear – the wind’s change in direction or speed with altitude – can tear a developing storm apart.
How much wind shear this potential system faces is a critical factor in its formation and final strength. One forecast model shows more wind shear, limiting its development. Another shows less wind shear, allowing the system to develop.
Either way, wind shear may decrease for a time early next week across the far northern Caribbean and eastern Gulf of Mexico, allowing any system that forms to hold together.
Franklin strengthens into hurricane as it heads for Bermuda
Meanwhile, out in the central Atlantic, what was Tropical Storm Franklin strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to a Saturday morning update from the National Hurricane Center. This was confirmed via aircraft reconnaissance by the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters.
Hurricane Franklin is currently located 620 miles south of Bermuda and is moving relatively slowly at 7 miles per hour towards the north-northwest.
“Steady strengthening is forecast, and Franklin could become a major hurricane early next week,” said the center in its update. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher with winds above 111 mph.
“Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting Bermuda by Sunday night,” the hurricane center said, noting that, “these swells are also likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend into early next week along portions of the East Coast of the United States.”
Small variations in Franklin’s track through the weekend will determine exactly how close it gets to Bermuda when it make its closest pass Monday and Monday night.
Franklin’s winds and rainfall will extend beyond its center. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are possible across Bermuda early next week as Franklin makes its closest approach. A few showers and thunderstorms are also possible across Bermuda as Franklin passes.

"Parts of tropical rainforests could get too hot for photosynthesis, study suggests",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/23/world/tropical-forest-heat-photosynthesis-climate-scn-intl/index.html,"Parts of tropical rainforests could get too hot for photosynthesis, study suggests
Some leaves in tropical forests from South America to South East Asia are getting so hot they may no longer be able to photosynthesize, with big potential consequences for the world’s forests, according to a new study.
Leaves’ ability to photosynthesize – the process by which they make energy from carbon dioxide, sunlight and water – begins to fail when their temperature reaches around 46.7 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit).
While this may seem high, leaves can get much hotter than the air temperature, according to the report published Wednesday in Nature by a group of scientists from countries including the US, Australia and Brazil.
The scientists used temperature data beamed down from thermal satellite sensors on the International Space Station, 400 kilometers (nearly 250 miles) above the Earth. They combined this with on-the-ground observations from leaf-warming experiments, in which scientists climbed into the canopy to painstakingly add sensors to leaves.
Rather than looking at average temperatures, the scientists were looking at extremes, said Christopher Doughty, associate professor in ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University and a report author. They found that average forest canopy temperatures peaked at 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) but some exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Currently, 0.01% of leaves are passing the critical temperature threshold beyond which their ability to photosynthesize breaks down, the report found, potentially killing the leaf and the tree.
This percentage, while small, is poised to increase as the world warms, the report said, posing a threat to the world’s tropical forests – which cover roughly 12% of the planet and hold more than half of the world’s species. They also provide a vital role in sucking up and storing carbon and helping to regulate the global climate.
“There are all sorts of potential feedbacks once you start losing bits of forests, even leaves on individual trees,” Doughty said on a call with reporters.
Tropical forests can withstand around 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 Fahrenheit) of additional global warming before they reach a tipping point in terms of their ability to photosynthesize, according to the report.
If warming exceeds this level, the amount of leaves surpassing critical temperature thresholds could rise to 1.4%, potentially causing large-scale leaf loss and the death of the whole tree, the report found.
This level of warming is not expected under current climate policies, which are estimated to bring 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels. But it is within the range of the most pessimistic climate scenarios if the world continues to burn fossil fuels.
While these figures may seem small, the risk is significant given how critical tropical trees are for life, the climate system and the planet.
“Almost all life – including humans – is dependent on photosynthesis for food either directly or indirectly,” said Kevin Collins, senior lecturer in environment and systems at the Open University, who was not involved in the research.
The findings indicate that global warming is putting this vital process at risk, he told the Science Media Centre. But, he added, there are more immediate concerns for tropical forests, including deforestation, wildfires and droughts.
Christopher Still, a forest ecosystem professor at Oregon State University, also not involved in the report, said that the research provided some novel insights. While there’s been a big focus on the impact of drought on tree loss, he told CNN, “this paper says it’s not just drought – we need to really also worry about the temperatures that leaves are reaching.”
While he acknowledged the numbers in the report are small, he added, “I would focus a little bit less on the percentages, and more on the concepts of leaves pushing up against these really high temperature conditions and how often that happens, how long it lasts and what it really means.”
Others were more cautious. Chloe Brimicombe, a climate scientist at the University of Graz in Austria, said that given how few leaves are reaching the critical temperature threshold, and how high warming would need to get before a tipping point, “this suggests in theory tropical forests are quite resilient to climate change.”
She told the Science Media Centre, “this is a simple model and trees and forest dynamics are much more complex than this.”
The report authors said despite uncertainties, the research gives important insights around how tropical forests will respond to climate change.
“It’s a little bit of a canary in the coal mine that we’re starting to see,” Joshua Fisher, a climate scientist at Chapman University and a report author, said on a call with reporters. “And you want to be able to detect something happening before it’s widespread.”"
Weather that drove eastern Canada’s devastating wildfires made twice as likely by climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/americas/canada-wildfires-climate-change-quebec/index.html,"Weather that drove eastern Canada’s devastating wildfires made twice as likely by climate change
The weather conditions that fueled record-shattering wildfires in eastern Canada earlier this summer – and sent plumes of hazardous air into the US – were made more likely and more intense by the climate crisis, according to a new report published Tuesday.
Scientists from the World Weather Attribution initiative – which calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events –  found human-caused climate change more than doubled the likelihood of hot, dry and windy conditions that drove the Quebec fires between May and July, and made this fire-prone weather at least 20% more intense.
The severity of Quebec’s fire season up to the end of July was also made 50% more intense by climate change, according to the report.
Climate change’s impact may be much greater than the study’s figures show, said Friederike Otto, co-founder of WWA and senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute in the UK, who added that the report had used the most conservative estimates.
Wildfires are complex to study because of the tangle of factors that influence them, but scientists say climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, is loading the dice in favor of more devastating fires.
“It’s becoming evident that the dry and warm conditions conducive to wildfires are becoming more common and more intense around the world as a result of climate change,” said Clair Barnes, a research associate at the Grantham Institute and a report author.
Canada has experienced an unprecedented fire season this year, amid hot and dry conditions. May to June was the warmest such two-month period in Canada since records began in 1940, breaking the previous record by a substantial margin – 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit).
More than 15 million hectares (over 37 million acres) across the country have been scorched – an area about the size of Illinois. The fires have killed at least 17 people and forced the evacuations of more than 150,000.
Quebec has been particularly affected, with the most area burned of any Canadian province. Wildfires have devastated 5.2 million hectares (12.8 million acres) there so far, about 26 times the average amount burned by late August.
The fires have also caused dangerous levels of air pollution in Canada and across swaths of the US, leading to school closures in both countries and a spike in asthma-related hospital visits. Smoke from the fires even made it to Western Europe.
It is by far the worst wildfire season Canada has ever experienced, and there are still more than two months left to go.
To understand the role of climate change in the fires, the WWA scientists looked at “fire weather” – including high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions, all of which help fires ignite, spread and intensify.
The scientists used data from the Fire Weather Index – a measure of fire danger – to gauge the persistence of extreme fire conditions as well as the severity of the fire season overall. They then used climate models to understand the role climate change played.
They concluded that a wildfire season as severe as the one Quebec experienced up to the end of July was at least seven times more likely to occur because of climate change, and that human-induced warming made Quebec’s total fire weather season at least 50% more intense.
Climate change also made the peak fire weather in Quebec during the same period at least twice as likely and 20% more intense, according to the report.
While Quebec’s fires were unprecedented, the report authors wrote, “they are no longer extremely unusual.”
In today’s climate, which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than preindustrial times, similar weather conditions can be expected once every 25 years, the report found.
Around 1,000 fires continue to rage across Canada, with 200 of them burning in the Northwest Territories, where thousands of people were evacuated Friday from the capital Yellowknife. About 35,000 people are under evacuation orders in British Columbia.
Kira Hoffman, a fire ecologist at the University of British Columbia and the Bulkley Valley Research Centre, who was not involved in the report, said there are many factors that contribute to extreme wildfire seasons, including logging, large-scale clearouts and abandoning Indigenous fire stewardship techniques.
But all these factors interact with the climate crisis, she told CNN. “A rapidly changing climate is creating longer, drier and hotter wildfire seasons across Canada,” Hoffman said.
One of the major concerns with increasingly intense fire behavior is the impact on wildfire management, said Michael Flannigan, BC research chair for Predictive Services, Emergency Management and Fire Science at Thompson Rivers University.
“If we see more days above fire intensity thresholds, we will see more escape fires, more area burned and more impacts to society,” he told CNN.
“Until we stop burning fossil fuels,” said Otto in a statement, “the number of wildfires will continue to increase, burning larger areas for longer periods of time.”

Growing and burying algae in the Sahara is the latest solution for the climate crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/18/africa/brilliant-planet-algae-carbon-removal-climate-morocco-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"Growing and burying algae in the Sahara is the latest solution for the climate crisis
Out in the Sahara Desert, in one of the most inhospitable environments imaginable, a natural solution to the climate crisis is growing ­– and at a rapid rate.
London-based startup Brilliant Planet has leased 6,100 hectares of land outside the remote coastal town of Akhfenir in southern Morocco, wedged between the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Sahara to the south. And it’s using it to cultivate algae.
Algae absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide and emits oxygen via photosynthesis, and has been doing so since before the first land plants ever existed. Brilliant Planet’s CEO Adam Taylor says the company has developed a way to grow algae at exponential rates starting in a beaker in a lab and ending in 12,000-square-meter pools of locally-sourced seawater. Taylor says the process mimics a natural algae bloom, and a test tube of algae can multiply to fill 16 of these giant pools – the equivalent of 77 Olympic-sized swimming pools – in just 30 days.
The algae is extracted from the water then pumped up a 10-story tower and sprayed into the desert air. In the roughly 30 seconds it takes to reach the ground, hot air dries the biomass out, leaving hypersaline algae flakes which can be collected and shallow buried, sequestering their carbon for thousands of years, the company claims.
“Nature-based solutions are a great way of removing carbon,” Taylor told CNN, arguing that deserts are an under-utilized environment.
“It does not cost a lot of money to rent the desert (and) governments are enthusiastic to have any economic activity,” he continued. What’s more, “You’re not competing with farms, you’re not competing with forests, you’re out of the way, not bothering people,” he said.
Removing carbon dioxide
The UN’s climate change panel the IPCC estimates that hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere by 2100 to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The best way to do that is hotly debated. Many carbon capture solutions have been proposed, the most headline-grabbing being direct air capture. The technology, which has received multi-billion dollar backing by the US Department of Energy, uses machines with filters to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can then be stored underground or used in materials like concrete. Yet the technology remains small-scale, while its detractors say it’s expensive, energy-intensive and unproven.
Other solutions, such as tree planting, biochar and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage have sought to make use of the natural carbon-capturing abilities of the planet’s flora. Each have their pros and cons, including the infrastructure required and the length of sequestration.
Using AI to monitor orphaned elephants in Botswana could usher in the return of the woolly mammoth
Taylor claims that Brilliant Planet’s solution can permanently remove 30 times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per hectare per year than a typical European forest.
In an email, Fatna Ikrame El Fanne, an environmental engineer and co-founder of grassroots movement Youth For Climate Morocco, described the use of algae as “a new and promising strategy” that “exemplifies an innovative use of natural process to address an urgent global issue.”
Morocco’s geographical characteristics make it a suitable environment, she said. “There are enormous desert regions in the country that might be converted for carbon capture and storage projects,” she added.
Nevertheless, El Fanne expressed caution. “Microalgae production on a large scale might damage local ecosystems, strain water resources, and modify habitats,” she said. “Sustainable land management approaches, efficient water consumption, ecological restoration, regulatory compliance, community participation, and continuing monitoring are required.”
Preparing to bloom
Brilliant Planet’s pilot site covers three hectares, and will be expanding to a 30-hectare demonstration facility at Akhfenir next year and the company has plans for a 200-hectare then a 1,000-hectare farm at the site.
A 1,000-hectare facility represents a baseline commercial site that would create around 250 jobs, mostly for skilled local workers, said Taylor.
Brilliant Planet plans to sell carbon credits to fund its operation and expansion. In July, it announced its first major deal, with global technology company Block, to remove 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide by 2027.
A ‘privilege to be out there’: South African wildlife photographer Chris Fallows on his storied career
Carbon offsetting schemes are growing in popularity but the industry has been accused of a lack of transparency and regulation, with dubious effectiveness.
Most carbon credits purchased are in the form of avoidance (such as avoiding deforestation) rather than carbon removal, said Robert Höglund, an independent climate advisor.
Höglund co-founded cdr.fyi, a platform that monitors the global market for carbon dioxide removal. Of the more than 4 million tons of CO2 purchased by companies listed (including Block), just over 2% have been removed to date – but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern, he said.
“The primary reason to buy carbon removal today is to further innovate and help the nascent sector to grow to meet its future need, not to maximize the number of tons removed today,” Höglund explained. “By pre-purchasing tons from start-ups, first-of-a-kind facilities can be built and the methods tested out.”
Taylor hopes the tangible, weighable algae flakes will make Brilliant Planet’s model attractive.
Brilliant Planet has received over $26 million in investment to date and another funding round is scheduled for later this year.
Its goal is to remove one million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year – the same annual emissions of 217,000 cars ­– by the end of the decade. That would take 10,000 hectares across multiple sites and investment of around $1 billion, said Taylor.
The CEO is undaunted by either figure. “Globally, we’ve identified about half a million square kilometers of flat desert-ocean land where it works,” Taylor said, adding that the company hopes to set up in Namibia next.
Even so, there’s an acknowledgement that one company can’t do it all – and can’t go it alone. “We are part of a cohort of probably 40 to 50 weird and wonderful ideas of how people can remove carbon from the atmosphere,” Taylor said, calling for “a Manhattan Project-type attitude” to tackling carbon capture.
Whether algae is the solution the world needs remains to be seen. But the idea’s growing on people."
Snake season starts early as unusually high temperatures hit Australia,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/17/australia/snakes-high-temperatures-australia-climate-intl/index.html,"Snake season starts early as unusually high temperatures hit Australia
Warming global temperatures are dangerous for people in many ways, but they’re proving ideal for one type of animal: venomous snakes.
As Australia’s east coast experiences one of its warmest winters on record, snake season appears to have started early. The Australian Reptile Park has issued an “urgent warning” for people to be on the look out for venomous snakes.
A rise in temperatures, coupled with winter rainfall, is the perfect environment for venomous snakes to become more active, the Australian Reptile Park said in a statement.
Snakes tend to “brumate” over the winter, a state similar to hibernation during which they become less active and often seek out a place to hide until temperatures start to climb again. Usually this doesn’t happen until September.
But the heat is enticing snakes to emerge sooner than usual and snake catchers have reported a significant increase in call outs  – a phenomenon rarely seen at this time of year, according to the Australian Reptile Park.
“It’s important that all Australians know that [snakes] do not go out of their way to harm people. Snake bites mostly occur when people are trying to catch or kill the snake, so if you don’t do either of those things, there’s a greater chance that you’ll be okay!” Billy Collett, operations manager at the park, said in a statement.
But he urged people to learn how to deal with snake bites, which can be fatal in as little as 30 minutes. These include keeping bite victims calm, removing jewelry and watches and bandaging the whole limb, not just the bite area. He also recommended people keep backyards clear of stacks of firewood and other materials which can creating ideal habitats for snakes.
As the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels, and global temperatures soar, Australia’s winters have been steadily warming.
Last month was the fourth warmest July on record for New South Wales, data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows. Across the country, temperatures were nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year.
In the UK, which this year experienced its hottest June on record by a significant margin, rising temperatures are also affecting its snake population – specifically pet snakes.
The animal non-profit the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) said more snakes in captivity are breaking free from their enclosures due to the warming climate."

The Northwest US has mostly been able to dodge major heat this summer, but it has arrived with a vengeance and could help to stoke and start wildfires, including in parts of western Canada where hundreds of wildfires are raging out of control.
People across parts of Washington and Oregon will face a rare “extreme” level of heat risk through Wednesday with temperatures expected to run as much as 20 degrees above normal.
The “extreme HeatRisk” is the highest possible risk level for heat, akin to a “high risk” for tornadoes. It is meant to warn of significant heat impacts, including heat-related illness, and urge preparation.

The temperatures are forecast to break records: Portland could hit 107 degrees Monday, which would break its old daily record and tie its hottest recorded temperature for August.
Eugene, Oregon, is also forecast to hit 107 degrees Monday, which would shatter its previous daily record of 101 degrees.
All told, more 230 heat records could be broken on Monday and Tuesday across the country.

In addition to the high heat, red flag warnings signaling the increased fire danger cover much of western Oregon and Washington.
Low humidity levels and gusty winds will make for prime fire conditions.
Roughly 2,600 firefighters are out battling the seven large fires burning across Oregon and Washington.
Even small fires, like the Lookout Fire in Lane County, Oregon, can cause issues fast. The 200-acre fire forced evacuations Sunday night, one of two fires forcing evacuations in the county. Weather conditions will cause the fires to easily spread and allow new ones to ignite.
The hot conditions are reaching as far north as Canada which is in the middle of its worst fire season on record. Heat warnings are currently in effect for southern sections of the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. The hot, dry conditions also fed more fires across British Columbia, where more than 375 active fires are currently burning. More than half of those have ignited in just the last 24 hours.
The exceptional heat also hasn’t let up across the South. The entirety of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are under heat alerts.
Excessive heat warnings, which is the highest level of heat alert, include major cities like Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta and Jacksonville, Florida.
Heat indexes will be 110 to 120 degrees across these cities.
Some temporary heat relief is coming for parts of the South, minus the Gulf Coast and Florida.
A cold front will push through the region tonight, dropping high temperatures for a large chunk of the heat oppressed back into the upper 80s to low 90s – a much more seasonal forecast.
The low 90s are still hot but will feel like a temporary break from the dangerous heat before it builds back in again by the end of the week."

How liberals unintentionally made it harder to fight climate change
A bedrock federal law designed to protect the environment and empower local communities is being weaponized to block progress on climate change, infrastructure and housing.
The battle over New York City’s landmark congestion price plan is the latest example.
After more than 50 years of efforts to implement a toll program that would slash greenhouse emissions from cars and reduce congestion in lower Manhattan, the plan cleared a milestone in May, when the federal government signed off on the release of an environmental assessment.
Then, last month, New Jersey sued to block the plan, citing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (NEPA). The law requires federal agencies to give a detailed assessment of the environmental impact before approving projects that could significantly alter the environmental landscape.
New Jersey said the government’s analysis, which spanned more than 4,000 pages and included feedback from 80,000 public comments, was not comprehensive enough.
Congestion taxes have been tested in major cities around the world and proven to be successful, if initially controversial. European cities like London and Stockholm have seen a range of benefits, including a reduction in congestion, a drop in carbon dioxide pollution and lower rates of pediatric acute asthma cases.
But New Jersey said the Federal Highway Administration failed to adequately consider the impact that congestion pricing would have on diverting traffic to the state and harming its environment. Lawmakers want the government to conduct a more thorough analysis — which could take years.
Advocates of NEPA reform say it’s ironic that New York City’s congestion tax — a project intended to curb greenhouse emissions and boost mass transit — is being scuttled via a law specifically designed to improve the environment.
Unintended consequences
In the United States, conservatives have pushed to weaken environmental regulations for years. But now, more and more Democrats in Congress and left-leaning researchers are embracing the idea of streamlining the review process.
They say they want to protect the environment, but that the process needs to be modernized for the climate-change era and government isn’t acting fast enough.
Some of these critics on the left say environmental review has become a labyrinth of paperwork and litigation to stop or delay key clean energy projects, raise construction costs and create uncertainty for businesses. The Democrats’ sweeping Inflation Reduction Act contained billions of dollars in tax credits designed to turbocharge energy, especially clean energy, but there are concerns that NEPA procedures will create hurdles to build these projects.
“Once you take a broader climate change approach, environmental review becomes a bad tool to helping the environment,” said Howard Slatkin, executive director at Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a progressive nonprofit research and education organization in New York City. “It punishes all of the things that smart growth offers,” he said, including density, housing development and public transit.
“A tool that was built to stop the bulldozing of trees is getting in the way of our climate future,” he said.
Reform advocates say other recent lawsuits — efforts to block expanding the number of students admitted to University of California, Berkeley; single-family housing zoning reform in Minneapolis; and affordable housing for seniors in New York City — show how environmental review procedures have become a barrier in some cases.
While projects drag on or get canceled, carbon emissions rise and the housing shortage worsens.
Slowing down government
The National Environmental Policy Act, passed by Congress in 1969 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on January 1, 1970, was considered the Magna Carta of environmental protection law.
Congress enacted NEPA, as well as the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act and other foundational environmental laws in the 1970s in response to growing environmental awareness and revolts over urban renewal projects like highway construction that displaced communities.
During the New Deal and post-World War II era, newly created federal and state agencies grew, rolling out massive public works projects.
“But by the 1960s, you see a backlash both from emerging environmental movements and from communities that feel agencies are riding roughshod over them,” said Paul Sabin, who teaches US environmental history at Yale University and is the author of “Public Citizens: The Attack on Big Government and the Remaking of American Liberalism.”
“NEPA emerged at a time where people thought that government was doing too much,” Sabin said. “It reflected an idea that we could slow change.”
The goal of NEPA was to require federal agencies to take environmental considerations into account during their planning and decision-making process — a “look before you leap” approach. It also gave local communities a greater voice in government decisions. States also enacted their own equivalents of NEPA, known as “little NEPAs.”
But critics say that, in practice, NEPA and state-level versions have drifted far beyond their original purpose.
While NEPA was initially intended to require review of “major” federal actions that could “significantly” affect the human and natural environment, more than 12,000 comprehensive environmental reviews are now conducted annually.
But around 98% of substantive NEPA reviews apply to projects that do not have a significant environmental impact, according to Eli Dourado, a senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University.
“When you impose these big, procedural requirements on basically everything, it privileges the status quo,” he said. “That’s good if you start with an environmentally pristine world, but it makes new things incredibly hard to do”
These reviews have ballooned in size and often add months or years of delay to badly needed projects, including clean energy projects.
On average, a full environmental analysis now takes 4.5 years to complete.
The environmental review process has “metastasized well beyond what anyone intended it to be,” Dourado said. “To me, it’s clearly dysfunctional.”
Reform efforts
The need to reform the environmental review process has become a bipartisan issue in recent years. But there are tensions between the competing goals of protecting the environment and also speeding up major infrastructure projects.
“This is a balancing between the need for speed and the need to protect core environmental values and the interest of communities,” said Elgie Holstein, a senior director for strategic planning at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former energy adviser to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
There is disagreement among Democrats and Republicans about how far to go, and a split has emerged within the environmental advocacy movement over whether to support changes to NEPA.
In 2020, President Donald Trump’s administration proposed a dramatic weakening of NEPA that would end the requirement for federal agencies to take climate change into account when they assess the environmental impacts of projects.
President Joe Biden’s administration scrapped this proposal, but last month proposed a new rule to speed up permitting for clean energy and other infrastructure projects under NEPA. The proposals emerged from the bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling.
The rule would designate a lead agency for each project review and set stricter deadlines and page limits for assessments. It would also mean that projects with clear, long-lasting positive impacts do not require comprehensive environmental impact analysis.
Projects like enabling hazardous fuel reduction in an area with high wildfire risk would be more easily excluded from environmental review, the administration said.
Some environmental groups believe these reforms are needed to advance clean energy progress and other goals. But other groups fear changes will undermine key environmental protections.
“Most of the environmental community is, at a minimum, leery of these proposals and very concerned about the possibility of the fervor for building out new energy infrastructure running roughshod over NEPA,” Holstein said.
While the Environmental Defense Fund supports the Biden administration’s reforms to NEPA, it’s against a draconian rollback of environmental review, he said.
“We don’t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater.”

"Ocean heat is off the charts, so where are the hurricanes? Forecasters warn a change is coming",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/10/weather/hurricane-season-ocean-temperatures-climate/index.html,"Ocean heat is off the charts, so where are the hurricanes? Forecasters warn a change is coming
Record-high ocean temperatures are setting the stage for an active Atlantic hurricane season with explosive tropical development, but just one thing is missing: storms. There have been no tropical storms in the Atlantic basin in nearly a month, and none so far this year have come close to the United States.
But the busiest stretch of hurricane season kicks off in less than a week. And with ocean heat running high, experts are urging people to get their safety plans in place and prepare for tropical trouble that could start within the next couple of weeks.
A growing expert consensus is now forecasting an uptick in hurricane activity. An updated outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday called for an above-average hurricane season – an increase from the near-normal forecast it released in May.
“We have increased the chance for above normal activity to 60% from 30%,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in a news release. “The chances of a below normal season are now at only 15%.”
Rosencrans told CNN there was “moderate confidence” conditions will become more conducive for tropical development within a week or two. And forecasters are honing in on the development potential in the open Atlantic during this time and into September, a forecast that lines up with typical climatology.
NOAA forecasters join other experts in the field that have recently increased their hurricane risk outlooks, including researchers at Colorado State University.
The forecasts are leaning on several climatological factors, but also on exceptionally warm oceans, which provide storms the fuel needed to explode in strength and even undergo rapid intensification. NOAA said sea surface temperatures were warmer than anticipated, and a major factor in increasing the odds of an active season.
“Considering those factors, the updated outlook calls for more activity, so we urge everyone to prepare now for the continuing season,” Rosencrans said.
Global ocean temperatures are at their highest levels on record. This is especially the case in the Atlantic, where sea surface temperatures are much above average in areas where hurricanes typically form. Notably, sea surface temperatures in parts of the Gulf of Mexico are in the middle 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit – well above the 80 degrees needed to sustain tropical storm development. Water temperatures have even recently climbed above 100 degrees in shallower water closer to the Florida coast.
Even with the abundance of very warm water, no tropical development has occurred in the Atlantic since Hurricane Don dissipated in late July.
Despite the lack of US impacts so far, there have been five named storms, putting this season slightly above the climatological normal for tropical activity.
And there have been recent signs that the tropical Atlantic could soon spring to life. Several thunderstorm areas have come close to developing, only to be torn apart by two things: wind shear, which is the change in strength in winds in different levels of the atmosphere, and dry air, which can cut off a storm’s lifeblood – its thunderstorm activity.
Wind shear and dry air have largely won out over warm ocean water over the past few weeks, suppressing hurricane activity. This is not altogether unusual as wind shear is typically strong at the start of hurricane season and gradually begins to ease through July and into August.
But just how much of a reduction in wind shear and dry air occurs headed into the typical peak of hurricane season is in question. Notably, El Niño is present and growing in the Pacific Ocean – an ocean and weather pattern that typically promotes an increase in wind shear and makes Atlantic hurricane seasons less active.
Rosencrans said El Niño’s influence had yet to arrive in the Atlantic, but could do so in September. He said there were already signs of wind shear lessening over an area in the Atlantic where storms typically form and that lower than normal wind shear was expected for the season and factored into expectations for an increase in activity.
When wind shear lessens and dry air exits, hurricane season will be off to the races with extreme ocean temperatures ready to fuel stronger storms.
Take last year for instance: Two storms – Alex and Colin – had already impacted the US by this time last year, but Colin’s dissipation was quickly followed by a lengthy inactive stretch where no additional storms formed in July or August. But once September arrived, along with it came a quick uptick in activity that culminated in devastating Hurricane Ian slamming the US to end the month.
Tropical activity spikes across the Atlantic from mid-August to mid-October due to a relative minimum in wind shear and a relative maximum in sea surface temperatures. This period alone accounts for an astounding 96% of all major hurricane days in a season, according to NOAA.
Even if tropical activity doesn’t pick up considerably in the next few weeks, any storm that does manage to form over very warm water with no wind shear to inhibit it has the potential to explode in strength and turn dangerous fast. And with hot water in place near highly populated areas of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, disaster can quickly strike if a tropical system is able to tap into that abundant energy."
Biden incorrectly claims he has declared a national emergency on climate,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/09/politics/climate-emergency-joe-biden/index.html,"Biden incorrectly claims he has declared a national emergency on climate
President Joe Biden incorrectly claimed in an interview with The Weather Channel that he has already declared a national emergency on the climate crisis.
“I’ve already done that,” Biden said when asked whether he intends to do declare a climate emergency. “We’ve conserved more land, we’ve rejoined the Paris Climate Accords, we’ve passed the $368 billion climate control facility. We’re moving. It is the existential threat to humanity.”
When pressed again on whether he had actually declared a national emergency, Biden said: “Practically speaking, yes.”
While Biden has taken a series of significant legislative and executive steps to combat climate change, he has stopped short of declaring a national emergency, which would unlock sweeping new federal authorities and funds to combat the climate crisis. Climate activists have called on Biden since the earliest days of his presidency to declare a national emergency.
Pressed about Biden’s claim, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that Biden was referring to his decision last year to invoke the Defense Production Act to spur production of clean energy technologies.
“What the president was talking about is the Defense Production Act. That’s something he did very early on,” Jean-Pierre said on “CNN This Morning.”
Defense Production Act authorities are unrelated to a national emergency declaration, which would give Biden power to restrict the export of crude oil and end offshore drilling, among other authorities.
A White House official added that Biden “was clear in the interview, as he has been for decades, about the existential threat of climate change and the urgency and priority he places on addressing it.”
The interview was done as part of the president’s four-day western swing in which he is attempting to drum up excitement for what he’s done to fight the climate crisis.
The president seemed close to declaring a climate emergency in the summer of 2022 after it appeared Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, had tanked the Inflation Reduction Act – Biden’s signature climate and health care bill. In a July 20, 2022, speech in Massachusetts, Biden strongly hinted that he could declare an emergency.
“Climate change is an emergency, and in the coming weeks I’m going to use the power I have as president to turn these words into formal, official, government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that a president possesses,” Biden said during that speech.
However, a deal was struck between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, a little more than a week later on the Inflation Reduction Act and Biden signed the bill into law in August 2022. It includes $369 billion in funding to combat climate change.
Since then, Biden has often touted the provisions in the law but has not formally declared a climate emergency.
The issue poses a dual challenge for the president and his campaign – selling skeptical Americans on the benefits of his already-enacted climate agenda while balancing the concerns of those who don’t feel like he’s done enough. Most Americans, 57%, disapprove of Biden’s handling of the issue, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Monday.
Climate advocacy groups are seizing on the moment and are pressing Biden to actually declare an emergency.
“Approving new fossil fuel projects like the Willow Project is not ‘practically’ declaring a climate emergency,” Sunrise Movement executive director Varshini Prakash said in a statement. “It’s a no-brainer to declare a climate emergency – and if President Biden said we already have, then why not do it now?”
Other groups, including the climate group coalition People vs. Fossil Fuels – which represents over 1,200 groups, released a statement saying Biden should “follow through on his rhetoric” by declaring a national emergency that could further speed up deploying clean energy and halting fossil fuel production.
“Now that President Biden says he’s ‘practically’ declared a climate emergency, it’s time to do it for real,” People vs. Fossil Fuels, a coalition of over 1,200 groups, said in their statement.

July hit a crucial warming threshold that scientists have warned the world should stay under,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/world/july-climate-record-paris-agreement/index.html,"July hit a crucial warming threshold that scientists have warned the world should stay under
The world got its first preview last month of what summer will be like at 1.5 degrees of global warming — a threshold that scientists warn the planet should stay under, yet one that it has flown increasingly close to in recent years.
The average global temperature in July, the hottest month on record by far, was around 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial era that ended in the mid-to-late 1800s, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service reported Tuesday.
The announcement came after a series of deadly heat waves and remarkable record-breaking temperatures for several continents, as well as unprecedented ocean heat around the globe. Copernicus scientists say it’s the first summer month that has surpassed 1.5 degrees, offering a glimpse of future summers.
The 1.5-degree threshold is significant because scientists consider it a key tipping point for the planet, beyond which the chances of extreme heat, flooding, drought, wildfires and food and water shortages will become even more unfavorable for life as we know it.
It’s the goal that scientists chose in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to minimize the damage of the climate crisis while affording time to wean society and the economy off planet-warming fossil fuels.
It’s also not something that’s tracked by the day or month. Scientists are particularly concerned that global temperature will stay above 1.5 degrees for the long term. Through 2022, the world had warmed around 1.2 degrees.
“While breaking the 1.5-degrees-Celsius threshold for a day or a week or a month is not the same as breaking it for the long-term average, it is important to monitor how frequently, and for how long, we exceed this threshold,” Rebecca Emerton, scientist with Copernicus, told CNN. “As temperatures continue to rise, the effects will continue to become more serious.”
The last few years have made it abundantly clear that the world is already feeling alarming effects of the climate crisis that many are not prepared for. If the planet continues to heat up, Emerton said the world will face even more extreme weather than what much of the planet has already experienced.
“We’ve seen the impacts these kinds of events are already having on people and on our planet, and so every small part of a degree of warming is significant,” Emerton said.
According to Berkeley Earth, an environmental data nonprofit, there have only been 10 other months that were warmer than 1.5 degrees Celsius above their historical average, with March 2023 being the most recent. Before that, the other months that have been 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial times have occurred during winter or early spring.
Berkeley Earth Lead Scientist Robert Rohde said surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius in July is the first time that threshold has ever been crossed during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, which makes this a critical moment for the planet.
“While the past unusually warm winters are notable, observing extreme warmth in summer is likely to have greater direct impacts on people’s lives,” Rohde, who is not involved with the Copernicus report, told CNN. “Adding 1.5 degrees Celsius in winter makes for a mild winter but doing it during summer can give rise to unprecedented extremes.”
Although Rohde said it is likely that 2023 will be the warmest year on record, it’s unlikely that 2023 as a whole will be 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial times.
“The year-to-date average is still below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we find it unlikely that the rest of 2023 will be warm enough to bring the whole year average above 1.5,” he said.
Copernicus scientists noted that as El Niño continues to develop, the world may witness more of these unprecedented temperature breaches.
“Even if the climate crisis does not accelerate, but continues on its current trajectory, we will see more days, weeks, months and years with record-breaking temperatures, and other impacts on our Earth system,” Emerton said. “We need to be doing all that we can to reduce emissions and limit future warming.”"
100-degree days are becoming more common in the cities where most people live. These charts explain why.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/us/heat-triple-digit-temperatures-dg/index.html,"100-degree days are becoming more common in the cities where most people live. These charts explain why.
Hot summer days in the United States have only been getting hotter. In the 25 largest US cities, days with highs breaking the 100-degree Fahrenheit barrier have become more common over the past 75 years, according to airport weather station data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
This year is no exception. Looking at the first seven months of each year, 2023 had the sixth-highest number of triple-digit highs in the 25 largest cities with available data since 1948, according to NOAA. Last year had the most days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit through the end of July in 75 years.
Experts told CNN the climate crisis is intensifying heat waves and pushing days that would normally top out in the upper-90s into the triple-digits. As the number of days with extreme heat become more common, that puts an increasing strain both on individuals – especially those who work outside or don’t have access to adequate shelter – and a city’s infrastructure.
“The climate has already changed. We’ve had increases in greenhouse gases for the past 150 years or more,” said David Easterling, chief of the Climate Assessments Section at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. “And what that translates to is that whether in Phoenix or Las Vegas, it’s just getting warmer there.”
Overall, people living in the 25 largest cities have put up with an average of three more annual days over 100 degrees over the past 20 years than between 1948 and 1980. The average number of triple-digit temperature days have become more frequent between those two periods in 17 of the 25 largest US cities with available data, according to NOAA.
Exactly how much more frequent triple-digit heat days have become varies widely across the country. Portland, Oregon, is seeing an additional day each year on average above 100 degrees since 2003 than it did between 1948 and 1980. Phoenix, on the other hand, is averaging 18 more triple-digit heat days between those same two periods.
The number of triple-digit days has risen the most for a handful of cities in the Southwest and South. Residents of Phoenix, Austin, El Paso and San Antonio have seen especially startling temperature changes over the past 20 years.
Between 1948 and 1980, there were 11 years when San Antonio didn’t see a single day above 100 degrees. Since 2003, though, the city has gone only one year without a day in the triple-digits.
In Phoenix, a year with under 90 days with temperatures above 100 degrees used to be fairly common – it happened in 16 of the years before 1980. That’s no longer the case. The last time the city saw fewer than 90 days in the 100s was in 1998.
There are always going to be local differences – the number of days over 100 degrees haven’t increased as much in Las Vegas as they have in Phoenix, Austin, El Paso or San Antonio, for example. But generally, temperatures go up significantly in areas where the soil and air are dry, Easterling said.
Air moisture, or humidity, regulates temperatures and prevents it from spiking to extreme levels. Phoenix, which is located in the Sonoran Desert, runs so hot in part because of its dry climate – it has averaged just 7.22 inches of rain per year since 1948, according to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport weather station data. That’s less than an inch per month.
But while humidity may moderate the air temperature, it can also make hot temperatures feel even hotter and put more pressure on the body, which struggles to cool itself in humid weather.
“It’s important for people to remember that impacts on people and infrastructure don’t start at 100 degrees,” said James Doss-Gollin, an assistant professor at Rice University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “Things like humidity and air quality can have a big impact on how our bodies feel heat.”
Even relatively small increases in the number of days of triple-digit temperatures can have a dramatic effect on a population.
Seattle’s Sea-Tac International Airport, for instance, recorded the lowest average number of days above 100 degrees out of any of the 25 largest cities over both 1948-1980 and since 2003. Between 1948 and 1980, not a single day broke 100 degrees. Then the airport registered three triple-digit days in 2021 alone.
“Urban areas really have to start taking this seriously and begin to say, ‘How can we create a cooler environment?’” Easterling said. “Because we’re going to see temperatures increase as we continue to increase greenhouse gas. It’s a big issue.”"
Global ocean temperatures soared to the highest level on record this week,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/world/ocean-heat-temperature-record-climate/index.html,"Global ocean temperatures soared to the highest level on record this week
The temperature of the planet’s oceans rose to new heights this week, setting a new record with no sign of cooling down.
The average global ocean surface temperature hit 20.96 degrees Celsius (69.7 Fahrenheit) at the end of July, according to modern data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, beating the previous record of 20.95 degrees Celsius set in 2016. The Copernicus ocean data goes back to 1979.
Scientists say the world needs to brace for ocean temperatures to keep rising as the arrival of El Niño – the natural climate fluctuation that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and has a warming impact – layers on top of human-caused global warming.
Kaitlin Naughten, an oceanographer at British Antarctic Survey, said the data from Copernicus painted an alarming picture for the health of the oceans.
“Other datasets may give slightly different values – for example, [the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] is reporting that last April was still very slightly warmer than now,” she told CNN.
But what’s clear, she said, is “that current sea surface temperatures are exceptionally and unseasonably warm” and bringing wide-ranging implications, “especially for complex ecosystems such as coral reefs.”
Gregory C. Johnson, an oceanographer at NOAA, said sea surface temperatures have soared this year. “What we’re seeing is a massive increase. It’s about 15 years worth of the long term warming trend in a year,” he told CNN.
The heat could increase even further. Surface temperatures tend to remain high from August through to September before starting to decline, said Johnson. “There’s still room to have warmer sea surface temperatures” this year.
Some marine heat waves this year have particularly shocked scientists for just how unprecedented they are, and the damage they are causing. Ocean heat can lead to the mass bleaching of coral reefs, as well as the death of other marine life and increased sea level rise.
In the Florida Keys, a marine heat wave has pushed ocean temperatures to record-breaking, “hot tub” levels, leaving multiple coral reefs now completely bleached or dead.
A “totally unprecedented” heat wave in the North Atlantic off the coasts of the UK and Ireland  in June – defined as “extreme” by NOAA – saw temperatures up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 Fahrenheit) hotter than usual, sparking concerns about the impacts on marine life.
Samantha Burgess, the deputy director of Copernicus, said the heat in the North Atlantic was astonishing.
“We’ve never seen that kind of extreme marine heat wave for that time of year … to see them in the open ocean, to see them in spring – that’s very surprising,” she told CNN in an interview last week.
Warmer ocean water also has a climate impact. Oceans play a vital role as a buffer against the climate crisis by absorbing planet-heating pollution. Warmer water does this less effectively, meaning more carbon is left in the atmosphere, fueling global warming.
Some scientists are concerned that the ocean temperature records set this year could mark the start of an alarming trend for ocean heat.
“We are continuing to put greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” Johnson said. “And so, in the long term, sea surface temperatures are just going to continue to increase until we as a society decide to to cut our use of fossil fuels very substantially.”"
Parts of South America are sweltering under a ‘fierce’ heatwave – and it’s the middle of winter,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/americas/south-america-winter-heatwave-climate-intl/index.html,"Parts of South America are sweltering under a ‘fierce’ heatwave – and it’s the middle of winter
Parts of South America are sweltering under abnormally hot temperatures – despite being in the depths of winter – as the combination of human-caused climate change and the arrival of El Niño feed into extreme winter heat.
Southern Cone countries including Chile and Argentina have experienced summer-like conditions as a heat wave, beginning in July, pushed temperatures higher than 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) in some places – dramatically above average for this time of year.
Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe, told CNN that South America is experiencing a “fierce winter heat wave.”
While such heat waves are not unheard of for the continent, this one has “exceptional characteristics for its area, duration, intensity and being early August,” Herrara said, adding “dozens of stations are recording their highest ever temperatures in the first half of August.”
August in the Southern Hemisphere is equivalent to February in the Northern Hemisphere.
Chile’s environment minister, Maisa Rojas, said that the world has been experiencing extreme events for weeks. “Yesterday it was the turn of South America and Chile,” she said in a Twitter post Wednesday.
Hace semanas que #EventosExtremos están quebrando récords en el mundo, visibilizando la #CrisisClimática. Ayer le tocó a Sudamérica y Chile.  🥵🌎 Abro hilo: 1/10 https://t.co/CyjcHZq7vL
In the mountainous Chilean Andes region, temperatures climbed to 38.9 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, according to Herrara, who described the event as “unbelievable” for mid-winter and “rewriting all climatic books.”
In the Coquimbo region in northern Chile temperatures average around 22 degrees Celsius (72 Fahrenheit) in February, at the height of its summer. But this year, in mid-winter, they have soared far higher.
The commune of Vicuña reached 37.1 degrees Celsius (98.8 Fahrenheit) on August 2.  “This temperature is the highest recorded in this period in all of Chile,” a spokesperson for the Meteorological Directorate of Chile told CNN.
It also marks the second-highest temperature on record for the country’s winter – which runs from June until August. Only in August 1951 was a higher temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius (99.1 Fahrenheit) recorded in Copiapó.
“Tuesday was likely the warmest winter day in northern Chile in 72 years,” Raul Cordero, a climatologist at University of Groningen in the Netherlands, told CNN.
In Argentina, some places reached highs of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4), according to the country’s national meteorological service.
The capital Buenos Aires – where August temperatures usually average 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 Fahrenheit) – experienced its hottest start to August in 117 years of data, with temperatures of just over 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) on August 1. This smashed the previous record for that day of 24.6 degrees Celsius (76.3 Fahrenheit) set in 1942.
For comparison, New Orleans’ average high the first week of February is also 18 degrees Celsius, and the city has never been above 28.3 degrees Celsius in the first week of February.
The high temperatures are expected to continue for the next five to six days, concentrated in Northern Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and southwest Brazil, where they could reach up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), Herrara told CNN on Wednesday.
Pushing temperatures ‘into the unknown’
“What we are experiencing is the combination of two phenomena: a global warming trend due to climate change plus the El Niño phenomenon,” Rojas said on Twitter.
El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean, brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and has a major influence on weather across the globe. Layered on top of global warming, caused by humans burning planet-warming fossil fuels, temperatures can reach record-breaking levels.
This extreme heat in parts of South America fits into a broader global pattern. July was the planet’s hottest month on record by a significant margin, and scientists found the heat waves that seared parts of the US, southern Europe and China in the Northern Hemisphere summer were made significantly more likely by the human-caused climate crisis.
“What to do? We know the solution: stop burning fossil fuels urgently!” Rojas said.
For Cordero, this winter’s unusual heat is alarming. “Just like the rest of the world, the combination of climate change and El Niño is pushing temperatures into the unknown,” he said."
"Colorado River Basin has lost 10 trillion gallons due to warming temps, enough water to fill Lake Mead, study shows",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/us/colorado-river-water-loss-lake-mead-climate/index.html,"Colorado River Basin has lost 10 trillion gallons due to warming temps, enough water to fill Lake Mead, study shows
Rising temperatures have sucked more than 10 trillion gallons of water out of the Colorado River Basin between 2000 and 2021 – a volume about the size of Lake Mead – according to a recent study.
Researchers at UCLA found the human-caused climate crisis is contributing significantly to the decline of the Colorado River, which runs through seven Western states and provides drinking and irrigation water for around 40 million people. Higher temperatures in the West have resulted in about a 10% decrease in the river’s flow in the last two decades, according to the study, which was published in the American Geophysical Union’s Water Resources Research.
The climate crisis has had such a significant impact on the basin that without it, the river’s first-ever water shortage would not have been declared, the researchers found. The Tier 1 shortage took effect in January 2022; a Tier 2 shortage – due to even lower water levels at Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir – was implemented in January 2023.
“When we set out on this study we were aware of the mega-drought and the impacts it was having on Lake Mead’s water levels,” Benjamin Bass, a water resources engineer and the study’s lead author, told CNN. “We really wanted to provide a study that was able to look at that long-term drought event and the impacts of anthropogenic climate change.”
State leaders and water users along the Colorado River have spent much of the last two years scrambling to find ways to cut their water usage as the system spiraled to alarming lows.
Last summer in particular set off alarm bells when the water level in Lake Mead dropped an astonishing 20 feet over the course of four months. Mead, fed by the Colorado River, fell to its lowest level to-date in July 2022, with lake elevation of 1040 feet. If it falls an additional 145 feet, the reservoir hits “dead pool,” the point at which it’s unable to provide water or hydroelectric power to millions of customers.
The increased evaporation from rising temperatures is especially problematic in snowier states like Colorado, where the river’s headwaters begin.
“It’s increasing more across the snow-packed region as compared to regions without snowpack,” Bass said, noting that reductions of water are happening “twice as fast” in snowier regions. That’s in part due to a positive albedo effect – what happens when more snow melts with higher temperatures, exposing darker ground that absorbs still more heat.
Bass and a team of researchers at UCLA conducted the experiment by modeling stream flow in the Colorado River basin under two conditions: one with historical temperature conditions and one where they removed the impacts of anthropogenic warming caused by climate change. They found that climate change-driven temperatures have had a dramatic impact, reducing flows over time.
Even though last winter dumped above-average snowpack and water into the basin, Bass said that the 10% reduction in flow from 2000 to 2021 has remained consistent, even during wetter years.
“That’s occurring for wet or dry years,” Bass said. “Even though there’s been a wet winter, there’s still going to be that 10% reduction in runoff.”
The UCLA study came to a similar conclusion as one conducted by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which projected an 11.7% decrease in annual stream flow, factoring in climate change.
Despite using different models, NCAR hydrometeorologist Ethan Gutmann told CNN the two studies came to the “same conclusion.”
“We expect the longterm increases in temperature that we know are going to continue and since the Colorado River basin in particular seems to be very sensitive to temperature, we expect runoff in this basin to continue to decline,” Gutmann said.
A blockbuster winter has helped Mead’s levels inch up this summer. The reservoir is expected to reach a high point of 1,070 feet in February 2024, according to the most recent federal data. Meanwhile, federal officials and state water users will soon start formal negotiations to see how water use in the basin can further be reduced, an attempt to counteract decades of overuse combined with the hotter and drier future in the Western US.
“Unless greenhouse gases are curbed, those [water] reductions are going to continue to track with temperature increases,” Bass told CNN."
"How to sleep in a heat wave, according to experts",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/31/health/sleep-cooler-heat-wave-wellness/index.html,"How to sleep in a heat wave, according to experts
Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.
Are you waking up in a puddle of sweat — if you can sleep at all? That’s the grim reality for millions of people around the globe suffering through severe, unbearable heat waves.
July is the hottest month on record for the planet and very likely the hottest period in 120,000 years, according to global climate authorities. “These are the hottest temperatures in human history,” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, told CNN recently.
It’s expected to get worse: A new study found the number of days of “dangerous heat” — defined as 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) — will more than double by 2050 in the midlatitude regions, which include Western Europe and countries such as China, Japan and the United States. Tropical areas could face those temperatures for the majority of the year.
It’s not just the unbearable sunshine — temperatures at night aren’t dropping as they should. Nights are warming faster than days on average in most of the US, the 2018 National Climate Assessment found. That’s dangerous for sleep — a vital period when the body and brain do housekeeping chores such as repairing and discarding old cells and generating new ones.
It’s the summer of changed climate. Get used to it
Warm nighttime temperatures have robbed people around the world of an average of 44 hours of sleep annually during just the first two decades of the 21st century, according to a 2022 study. And unfortunately, daytime naps and longer sleep on cooler nights did not seem to make up for that lost sleep, researchers found.
To get the best quality sleep, experts have long recommended sleeping in a cool room — between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 to 19.4 degrees Celsius) is best. What happens when you can’t achieve that during a heat wave?
Studies have shown higher nighttime temperatures increase wakefulness and reduce deep wave and REM (rapid eye movement), both critical to how well the body repairs and refreshes itself at night.
Exposure to heat waves during pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, according to a 2019 study. Older adults may have higher heart rates and more physiological stress when sleeping in warmer temperatures. A 2008 Australian study even found deaths due to mental and behavioral disorders rose during heat waves, especially for older adults.
Learning how to better cope with sleep problems during heat waves might limit the negative impact on our health, according to a team of experts from the European Insomnia Network. Here are their top tips, along with some guidance from experts in the US.
Stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water during the day can help your body better regulate your temperature at night.
But don’t drink for the hour or two before bed, or you’ll end up waking yourself in the night to go to the bathroom, said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. Instead, “try sucking on ice cubes before bed.”
Hydration can significantly impact your physical health, study finds
Eat light. Eating lighter, especially for the last meal of the day, can help set you up for better sleep, experts say. Avoid sugar and carb-laden foods, saturated fats and too much fiber as the day goes on, as that can disrupt sleep as well, according to a 2016 study.
Dress lightly. Sleep in the buff or choose loose, cotton clothing — avoid synthetics, which can trap heat next to the skin.
Look for chances to cool the bedroom. If you’re lucky enough to have a cooler period during the day, open windows and doors and start up fans to ventilate the bedroom, then close it off when the temperature rises.
If there are no breaks from the heat, close blinds, pull window shades, and do what you can “to keep the house and bedroom as cool and dark as possible both during day and night,” the network experts suggested.
7 summer drinks that don’t require artificial sweeteners
Avoid alcohol. Drinking booze in the evening dehydrates the body and sets you up for nighttime sweats, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine and professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
Set aside time to relax. For you and your child, set aside an hour or more before bedtime for calming activities, such as “reading a book, listening to a story or to music. This could help in cooling down and relaxing,” according to the network.
Shower in tepid water. Before you hit that hot sack, take a lukewarm or cool (but not cold) shower or foot bath, which may help to reduce your heat stress and set you up for sleep. How does that happen?
“Your body temperature lowers after you leave the shower or bath as your body adapts to the cooler environment,” Dasgupta said. “This drop in temperature prepares your body for sleep because our body temperature has a natural circadian rhythm — the body is primed to cool down when you lay down and warm up when you get up.”
Find the coolest place to sleep. Try your best to keep your bedroom cooler than 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) if you can. To do so, try using ceiling fans or floor or bedside electric fans, which use “up to 50-times less electricity” than air conditioning,” the review noted.
Exposure to extreme heat and pollution may double risk of a deadly heart attack, study shows
“There are also fairly inexpensive ice cooling fans that can be placed near the bed,” Zee told CNN. “If you’re unable to keep the bedroom cool, sleeping temporarily on lower floors like the basement (if there is one) will be cooler.”
Keep a regular sleep schedule. If you sleep badly one night, don’t go to bed early the next, experts said. It’s important to stick to a regular bedtime to train the brain that it’s time to sleep, regardless of the temperature.
If you do wake up early and can’t go back to sleep without 15 to 20 minutes, get up and do something soothing and mindless, such as folding laundry, until you’re sleepy. If that doesn’t work, start your day, the network experts suggest.
Exercise safely. Don’t put aside exercise, even in the heat. Try to do some physical activity in the early morning, when it is still relatively cool outdoors, experts suggest, as a key way to keep a regular sleep and wake schedule.

But relief is a relative term. We are on the cusp of the start of August, which in Arizona historically is just a couple of degrees cooler than July. And in this year of record-shattering heat, it’s impossible to know whether the past patterns will hold.
Phoenix was actually enjoying a surprisingly mild summer. Then July hit. The city has made headlines around the globe and broken all sorts of records. It’s currently enduring the longest stretch topping 110 F or higher (29 days and counting). Phoenix just finished 16 straight days with lows above 90 F. Mid-July featured nine consecutive days at or above 115 F.
I’ve lived in the aptly named “Valley of the Sun” since childhood, so I’m used to the region’s scorching heat and dust-dry desert climate. But even for natives, the month has been brutal.
The city’s transportation service is providing buses to the homeless so they can at least sit in an air-conditioned space during the hottest part of the day. For those even less fortunate, the county coroner has rented refrigerated containers as backup storage.
Opinion: Vacations as we know them are over
“While we typically see a surge in intakes to the Office of the Medical Examiner in July, this year has been worse than prior years,” Jason Berry, a Maricopa County spokesman, said last week.
Phoenix still hasn’t topped its all-time high of 122 F back in 1990 — at least not yet. As I write, it’s a balmy 112 F.
Many commentators are quick to blame climate change but offer few concrete solutions to mitigate the issue Phoenix summers will always be hot — I mean, it’s Phoenix — but smart solutions can keep it from getting worse.
I often explain to outsiders that Phoenix only has two months of awful heat — about mid-July to mid-September. That’s when the humidity rises a touch, with the temperatures north of 100 F late into the evening. (I’ll still take two hot months over four months of gray, icy winter misery in the upper Midwest.)
That said, it doesn’t take a climate scientist to recognize the rising intensity of our summers. Growing up on the northern edge of the sprawling city, the days were hot, but nights cooled off considerably. There isn’t much heat retention in the open desert, especially compared with the hundreds of square miles of black pavement and urban sprawl. Once the sun sets, city streets slowly release the pent-up heat for many hours.
Our Sonoran Desert region also gets annual monsoon storms this time of year, which usually help mitigate the highest highs. So far, those dramatic thunderstorms haven’t made much of an appearance. Seemingly it’s less so each year.
The rapid growth of Phoenix has created a “heat island” effect. Replacing virgin desert with concrete, glass and steel resulted in a thermal dome extending vertically above the city, leading to much higher nighttime temperatures.
Opinion: How I talk to my kids about climate change
As monsoon storms gather strength in the late afternoon, the rising urban heat raises the atmospheric pressure above the city. This pushes the cooling rains away from Phoenix and its expansive suburbs. More rain for the open deserts, but precious little for us sweaty city folk.
And the more desert cities grow, the worse the heat island effect. Thankfully, new fixes are being rolled out to reduce the problem.
Visitors often remark on Arizona “lawns” consisting of sandy-colored desert rock and a few desert plants. (My Midwestern relatives never let me hear the end of it.) But adaptive xeriscaping reduces the use of precious water and returns these little plots of land into cooler desert spaces.
On a larger scale, replacing blazing-hot asphalt with “cool pavements” reflects more solar energy, enhances water evaporation and doesn’t retain as much heat. Following a successful 2021 pilot program, Phoenix began coating streets with a unique treatment that significantly reduces street temperatures. So far, 100 miles have been covered, with many more on the way.
The city also instituted a cool roof program 10 years ago, replacing darker standard roofs with much more reflective colors and materials. So far, only 3.5% of buildings in the area can be considered “cool,” but it’s well worth the upgrade. A 2021 study by Arizona State University found the process reduces energy use by an average of 17% and keeps roofs as much as 50 degrees cooler.
By redoubling its commitment to these promising technologies, Phoenix can reduce the heat island effect and help temperatures return to their natural level. At the same time, these technologies can reduce energy demand, air conditioning costs and health issues, helping both residents and the climate.
Phoenix doesn’t have the luxury to wait for world leaders to “fix” the climate, whatever that might entail. The city’s rapid growth helped create the rising urban temperatures; it’s up to us residents to solve it."
"Why Republicans can’t get out of their climate bind, even as extreme heat overwhelms the US",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/30/politics/republicans-climate-solutions-heat-wave/index.html,"Why Republicans can’t get out of their climate bind, even as extreme heat overwhelms the US
Deadly heatwaves are baking the US. Scientists just reported that July will be the hottest month on record. And now, after years of skepticism and denial in the GOP ranks, a small number of Republicans are urging their party to get proactive on the climate crisis.
But the GOP is stuck in a climate bind – and likely will be for the next four years, in large part because they’re still living in the shadow of former president and 2024 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.
Even as more Republican politicians are joining the consensus that climate change is real and caused by humans, Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric has driven the party to the right on climate and extreme weather. Trump has called the extremely settled science of climate change a “hoax” and more recently suggested that the impacts of it “may affect us in 300 years.”
Scientists this week reported that this summer’s unrelenting heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” were it not for the planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels. They also confirmed that July will go down as the hottest month on record – and almost certainly that the planet’s temperature is hotter now than it has been in around 120,000 years.

In pictures: Heat wave spans across US coasts
Yet for being one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century, climate is rarely mentioned on the 2024 campaign trail.
“As Donald Trump is the near presumptive nominee of our party in 2024, it’s going to be very hard for a party to adopt a climate-sensitive policy,” Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah, told CNN. “But Donald Trump’s not going to be around forever.”
When Republicans do weigh in on climate change – and what we should do about it – they tend to support the idea of capturing planet-warming pollution rather than cutting fossil fuels. But many are reticent to talk about how to solve the problem, and worry Trump is having a chilling effect on policies to combat climate within the party.
“We need to be talking about this,” Rep. John Curtis, a Republican from Utah and chair of the House’s Conservative Climate Caucus, told CNN. “And part of it for Republicans is when you don’t talk about it, you have no ideas at the table; all you’re doing is saying what you don’t like. We need to be saying what we like.”
Extreme weather changes GOP minds
With a few exceptions, Republicans largely are no longer the party of full-on climate change denial. But even as temperatures rise to deadly highs, the GOP is also not actively addressing it. There is still no “robust discussion about how to solve it” within the party, said former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis, who now runs the conservative climate group RepublicEn, save for criticism of Democrats’ clean-energy initiatives.
“The good news is Republicans are stopping arguing with thermometers,” Inglis told CNN. Still, he said, “when the experience is multiplied over and over of multiple days of three-digit temperatures in Arizona and record ocean temperatures, people start to say, ‘this is sort of goofy we’re not doing something about this.’”
Meanwhile, the impacts of a dramatically warming atmosphere are becoming more and more apparent each year. Romney and Curtis, two of the loudest climate voices in the party, both represent Utah – a state that’s no stranger to extreme heat and drought, which scientists say is being fueled by rising global temperatures.
“There are a number of states, like mine, that are concerned about wildfires and water,” Romney said, adding he believes Republican governors of impacted states have been vocal about these issues.
Utah and other Western states are looking for ways to cut water use to save the West’s shrinking two largest reservoirs, Lakes Powell and Mead. And even closer to home, Utah’s Great Salt Lake has already disappeared by two-thirds, and scientists are sounding alarms about a rapid continued decline that could kill delicate ecosystems and expose one of fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the nation to toxic dust.
“I think the evidence so far is that the West is getting drier and hotter,” Romney told CNN. “That means that we’re going to have more difficulty with our crops, we’re going to have a harder time keeping the rivers full of water. The Great Salt Lake is probably going to continue to shrink. And unfortunately, we’re going to see more catastrophic fires. If the trends continue, we need to act.”
An issue ‘held hostage’
While Republicans blast Democrats’ clean energy policies ahead of the 2024 elections, it’s less clear what the GOP itself would prefer to do about the climate crisis.
As Curtis tells it, there’s a lot that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on. They both want to further reform the permitting process for major energy projects, and they largely agree on the need for more renewable and nuclear energy.
As the head of the largest GOP climate caucus on the Hill, Curtis’ Utah home is “full solar,” he told CNN, and is heated using geothermal energy.
While at a recent event at a natural gas drilling site in Ohio, as smoke from Canada’s devastating wildfire season hung thick in the air, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was asked how he would solve the climate crisis. He suggested planting a trillion trees to help offset the pollution created by burning fossil fuels – a bill House Republicans introduced in 2020. The measure has not yet passed the House and has an uncertain future in the Senate.
But the biggest and most enduring difference between the two parties is that Republicans want fossil fuels – which are fueling climate change with their heat-trapping pollution – to be in the energy mix for years to come.
Democrats, meanwhile, have passed legislation to dramatically speed up the clean energy transition and prioritize the development of wind, solar and electrical transmission to get renewables sending electricity into homes faster.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats want to pass more climate legislation if they take back a full majority in Congress. He later told CNN the GOP is “way behind” on climate and there’s been “too little” progress on the party’s stances.
“I think we’d get a lot more done with a Democratic House, a Democratic president and continuing to have a Democratic Senate,” Schumer told CNN. “Unfortunately, if you look at some of the Republican House and Senate Super PACs, huge amounts of money come from gas, oil and coal.”
Even though Curtis and Romney are aligned on the party needing to talk about climate change, they differ on how to fix it. While Curtis primarily supports carbon capture and increased research and development into new technologies, Romney is one of the few Republicans speaking in favor of a carbon tax – taxing companies for their pollution.
“It’s very unlikely that a price on carbon would be acceptable in the House of Representatives,” Romney said. “I think you might find a few Republican senators that would be supportive, but that’s not enough.”
The idea certainly doesn’t have the support of Trump, or other 2024 candidates for president, and experts predict climate policy will get little to no airtime during the upcoming presidential race.
“Regrettably, the issue of climate change is currently being held hostage to the culture wars in America,” Edward Maibach, a professor of climate communication at George Mason University and a co-founder of a nationwide climate polling project conducted with Yale University, told CNN in an email. “Donald Trump’s climate denial stance will have a chilling effect on the climate positions of his rivals on the right — even those who know better.”
Even if climate-conscious Republicans say Trump won’t be in the party forever, Inglis said even a few more years may not be enough time to counteract the rapid changes already happening.
“That’s still a long way away,” Inglis said. “The scientists are saying we can’t wait, get moving, get moving.”"
Antarctica is missing an Argentina-sized amount of sea ice – and scientists are scrambling to figure out why,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/30/world/antarctic-sea-ice-winter-record-low-climate-intl/index.html,"Antarctica is missing an Argentina-sized amount of sea ice – and scientists are scrambling to figure out why
As the Northern Hemisphere swelters under a record-breaking summer heat wave, much further south, in the depths of winter, another terrifying climate record is being broken. Antarctic sea ice has fallen to unprecedented lows for this time of year.
Every year, Antarctic sea ice shrinks to its lowest levels towards the end of February, during the continent’s summer. The sea ice then builds back up over the winter.
But this year scientists have observed something different.
The sea ice has not returned to anywhere near expected levels. In fact it is at the lowest levels for this time of year since records began 45 years ago. The ice is around 1.6 million square kilometers (0.6 million square miles) below the previous winter record low set in 2022, according to data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).
In mid-July, Antarctica’s sea ice was 2.6 million square kilometers (1 million square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average. That is an area nearly as large as Argentina or the combined areas of Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado
‘The game has changed’
The phenomenon has been described by some scientists as off-the-charts exceptional – something that is so rare, the odds are that it only happens once in millions of years.
But Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that speaking in these terms may not be that helpful.
“The game has changed,” he told CNN. “There’s no sense talking about the odds of it happening the way the system used to be, it’s clearly telling us that the system has changed.”
Scientists are now scrambling to figure out why.
The Antarctic is a remote, complex continent. Unlike the Arctic, where sea ice has been on a consistently downwards trajectory as the climate crisis accelerates, sea ice in the Antarctic has swung from record highs to record lows in the last few decades, making it harder for scientists to understand how it is responding to global heating.
But since 2016, scientists have begun to observe a steep downwards trend. While natural climate variability affects the sea ice, many scientists say climate change may be a major driver for the disappearing ice.
“The Antarctic system has always been highly variable,” Scambos said. “This [current] level of variation, though, is so extreme that something radical has changed in the past two years, but especially this year, relative to all previous years going back at least 45 years.”
Several factors feed into sea ice loss, Scambos said, including the strength of the westerly winds around Antarctica, which have been linked to the increase of planet-heating pollution.
“Warmer ocean temperatures north of the Antarctic Ocean boundary mixing into the water that’s typically somewhat isolated from the rest of the world’s oceans is also part of this idea as to how to explain this,” Scambos said.
In late February of this year, Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent since records began, at 691,000 square miles.
This winter’s unprecedented occurrence may indicate a long-term change for the isolated continent, Scambos said. “It is more likely than not that we won’t see the Antarctic system recover the way it did, say, 15 years ago, for a very long period into the future, and possibly ‘ever.’”
Others are more cautious. “It’s a large departure from average but we know that Antarctic sea ice exhibits large year to year variability,” Julienne Stroeve, a senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center told CNN, adding “it’s too early to say if this is the new normal or not.”
Cascading effects
Sea ice plays a vital role. While it doesn’t directly affect sea level rise, as it’s already floating in the ocean, it does have indirect effects. Its disappearance leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them more vulnerable to melting and breaking off.
A lack of sea ice could also have significant impacts on its wildlife, including krill on which many of the region’s whales feed, and penguins and seals that rely on sea ice for feeding and resting.
More broadly, Antarctica’s sea ice contributes to the regulation of the planet’s temperature, meaning its disappearance could have cascading effects far beyond the continent.
The sea ice reflects incoming solar energy back to space, when it melts, it exposes the darker ocean waters beneath which absorb the sun’s energy.
Parts of Antarctica have been seeing alarming changes for a while. The Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of icy mountains which sticks off the west side of the continent, is one of the fastest warming places in the Southern Hemisphere.
Last year, scientists said West Antarctica’s vast Thwaites Glacier – also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” – was “hanging on by its fingernails” as the planet warms.
Scientists have estimated global sea level rise could increase by around 10 feet if Thwaites collapsed completely, devastating coastal communities around the world.
Scambos said that this winter’s record low level of sea ice is a very alarming signal.
“In 2016, [Antarctic sea ice] took the first big down-turn. Since 2016, it’s remained low, and now the bottom has fallen out. Something major in a huge part of the planet is suddenly behaving differently from what we saw for the past 45 years.”

"Relief from heat wave is on the way for Northeast and mid-Atlantic, but southern areas remain at risk",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/29/weather/us-heat-wave-saturday/index.html,"Relief from heat wave is on the way for Northeast and mid-Atlantic, but southern areas remain at risk
The brunt of extreme heat that has been choking the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions this week is expected to end late Saturday, but many in the southern US are set to endure suffocating temperatures for a few more days as heat-related deaths rise.
More than 100 million people in more than 20 states – from California to Massachusetts – are under heat alerts, according to the National Weather Service. However, most of the alerts are expected to expire Saturday night. During the day, though, temperatures will not let up.
“Many places are set to break their temperature records for daytime highs as well as warm nighttime lows through Saturday morning,” the National Weather Service said, adding that some areas in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic can expect their highest temperatures so far this year.
The dangerously high temperatures have proven deadly in Arizona, Illinois and Texas as the expansive heat wave spread across much of the country, with humidity also playing a role in exacerbating the physical impacts on humans, animals and plants.
Experts agree that human-induced climate change is a main factor leading to record high temperatures, and scientists say July will be the planet’s hottest month on record.
Heat indexes – a measure of what the temperature feels like on the skin when accounting for relative humidity – are expected to hover around 100 and 110 degrees Saturday over parts of the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
But relief is on the way for some: On Sunday, a cold front will progress through the mid-Atlantic, ultimately ending the heat wave for much of the East Coast.
Meanwhile, the Southwest is expected to remain in a heat wave for several days before some ease sets in. Phoenix may end its dayslong streak of highs above 110 degrees on Sunday, while Las Vegas is expected to see highs exceeding 100 degrees into early next week. Another heat wave is expected to build early next week across the South and Gulf Coast.
Here’s how the heat has been impacting communities across the country:
• Heat-related deaths rise in US: In Illinois, a 53-year-old woman died Thursday in her Peoria apartment, which didn’t have air conditioning because power had been disconnected there, the Peoria County coroner’s office said. She died from “an exacerbation of her chronic medical conditions due to the excessive heat in the apartment,” the coroner’s office said. In Texas, a 66-year-old woman died early Tuesday from the extreme heat after being taken to a hospital from her apartment in North Richland Hills, police said.
• Arizona county prepares for overflow of deaths: Arizona’s Maricopa County has added 10 refrigerated containers to handle a possible overflow of heat-related deaths. The containers haven’t been needed yet, but the medical examiner’s office is over its normal capacity, a county spokesperson told CNN affiliate KTVK/KPHO. The county, home to the state’s most populous city, Phoenix, had already reported 25 heat-associated deaths so far this year as of Monday. Dozens of other deaths were under investigation for a potential link to heat.
• Heat alerts: Washington, DC, and parts of Maryland and Virginia along with St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, are under an excessive heat warning Saturday. Philadelphia, New York City, and Newark, New Jersey, are under heat advisories.
The extreme heat has taken a toll on animals in Tennessee this week. Authorities rescued 21 dogs from a garage and a concrete shed-like structure on the premises of a Lawrenceburg home that’s “unfit for human or animal lodging,” the Lawrence County sheriff said. Temperatures in the area were in the 90s, and the dogs had no food or water. The dogs were removed from the property and received treatment.
In Arizona this week, some cactuses died at a Phoenix botanical garden from soaring temperatures, and officials in the state also were reporting emergency room visits for extreme heat burns after people fall to the ground.

AC is hard on the planet. This building has a sustainable solution
In mid-July at the construction site at 1 Java Street in Brooklyn, New York, the outside temperatures can reach sweltering highs in the 90s. But 500-feet underground, it’s 55 degrees all year round.
That stable, underground temperature will be key to making life comfortable in the residential building that will soon sit on the site, a scenic spot in the Greenpoint neighborhood along Brooklyn’s waterfront.
With 834 rental apartments plus commercial space, 1 Java Street is set to be the largest multifamily, residential building with “geothermal” heating and cooling system in New York State — and potentially the country — when it’s completed in late 2025, according to developer Lendlease.
Geothermal technology is essentially a more eco-friendly version of an HVAC system, allowing the building spaces and water to be cooled and heated more efficiently, without traditional window AC units and natural gas. Lendlease says the technology will make it possible for the nearly 790,000-square foot building to release around 55% less carbon and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
With summer temperatures reaching record highs around the world, experts say finding ways to cool buildings that are less taxing on the environment could be crucial in fighting climate change. Even back in 2018, air conditioning and electric fans accounted for around 20% of total global electricity use, according to a report cpublished that year by the International Energy Agency. Now, energy and urban development experts are urging cities and developers to implement new solutions to keep buildings cooler. And both New York City and the Biden administration have identified geothermal systems as one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“Whenever we look at a site, we consider how we can make it more sustainable,” Layth Madi, Lendlease’s senior vice president and director of development, told CNN, adding that the development firm is aiming to reach net zero by 2025 and be fully decarbonized by 2040.
“I think many residents will choose to live in this building because of its green credentials,” Madi said. “We know a lot of people are thinking about climate change and our impact on the planet.”
Geothermal plumbing works by sending water from a building deep into the ground below it to take advantage of the earth’s naturally stable internal temperature — on hot days, the underground temperature will reduce the temperature of warm water from the building to help with cooling; on cold days, it will warm up cold water to help with heating.
At 1 Java Street, construction crews are drilling 320 holes, each around 4 inches in diameter and 499-feet deep, to create the building’s geothermal piping system through which the water will be pumped.
“Your thermostat turns on and it tells your building, ‘I need heating or cooling.’ And it energizes pumps, and those pumps flow fluid through the [geothermal] circuit that we’ve established here on site,” said Adam Alaica, director of engineering and development at Geosource Energy, the Canadian firm that’s installing and drilling the vertical geothermal piping at 1 Java Street.
For now, the process doesn’t come cheap. Installing the building’s geothermal system increased construction costs by around 6%, according to Madi, and required securing equipment and trained manpower that remains relatively scarce.
“We’re seeing rapid growth — I would say approaching that of exponential growth year over year in interest in the technology, which is very exciting for the industry as a whole,” Alacia said. “The bottlenecks to that growth have always been, and will continue to be in the years to come, specialty machinery to implement this infrastructure and the people resources it takes to do this.”
Eventually, though, as more developers invest in geothermal and more companies provide the specialty training needed to install the technology — Geosource operates its own training program — Madi said he expects the costs to come down. And once the building is up and running, it should be more cost efficient to heat and cool.
Lendlease didn’t specify whether residents of 1 Java Street will experience any cost savings on utilities thanks to the geothermal system (the units themselves will be priced at market rate, with 30% of them set aside as affordable housing). “Ultimately, it will be up to tenants to manage their power consumption and work with the utility company on billing,” the company told CNN.
While 1 Java Street will be one of relatively few geothermal buildings in the state, the companies behind its development say New York — and the world — could use more buildings like it.
“Geothermal is not a new technology … there’s kind of a primitive component to it, using the earth as a heat source and heat sink,” Alacia said. “In general, geothermal can really be used anywhere you have ground under your feet … The cost and the business case can vary, but technically it has strong credentials really anywhere in the country.”

Heat is intensifying for millions of people in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic Thursday, creating a “heat health emergency” as nearly half of the country bakes in dangerously high temperatures.
Around 150 million people from coast to coast are under heat alerts Thursday after extreme heat expanded into the highly populated I-95 corridor, bringing the highest temperatures of the year there.
The heat also won’t let up in the South and Southwest, where heat-related deaths are climbing, emergency rooms are filling with heat-related burn victims and even animals are falling victim to heat illness.
Live updates: The latest news on heat and extreme weather
Heat indexes – a measure of what the temperature feels like when accounting for relative humidity – are expected to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit across many areas in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Friday.
These kinds of temperatures can be deadly – heat kills more people in an average year than hurricanes and tornadoes combined – so both Boston and Philadelphia have declared heat emergencies, opening cooling centers and warning residents to check on the elderly and others most vulnerable to heat illness.
“Let’s be clear: heat can kill,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on Twitter Thursday. “This is dangerous. Take precautions.”
New York has also opened cooling centers as nearly 9 million residents across the nation’s largest city are under an excessive heat warning through 9 p.m. Friday. Temperatures in the mid-90s combined with high dew points will drive up the heat index and make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. Those temperatures will feel even hotter for millions of New Yorkers in intense urban heat island hot spots.
The temperatures are also testing infrastructure. PJM Interconnection – the nation’s largest power grid system – has declared an emergency alert. The move activates all systems to be online, including those with planned outages.
PJM coordinates electricity for more than 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, DC, according to its website.
And high heat has already disrupted work on some major US oil refineries, one of several factors driving higher gas prices.
Here are some other notable places bracing for and dealing with the severe heat:
Possible severe storms threaten Northeast megalopolis
The Northeast, mid-Atlantic and upper Midwest face an additional weather threat Thursday: strong-to-severe storms that could disrupt travel and knock out power amid the sweltering heat.
Brief and isolated tornadoes can’t be ruled out, but the Level 2 out of 5 threat is primarily for damaging winds that could affect the entire I-95 corridor from Washington, DC, to Boston. The storms should fire up in the early afternoon into the evening and could affect the afternoon rush hour commute, so also look out for flooding on roadways.
Parts of northern Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota, including Duluth, Minnesota, are under a Level 3 out of 5 threat Thursday for damaging storms that could produce wind gusts as high as 75 mph along with large hail. The Twin Cities faces a Level 2 out of 5 threat, also for strong winds and hail. Wind gusts that strong could easily down power lines and make for a miserably hot powerless evening.

Summer heat is breaking records across the US. More than 2,300 heat records have already been broken, with cities like Phoenix and Dallas hitting triple-digit temperatures. These numbers should not be shocking — if anything, they fit a long-term pattern of record-breaking temperatures due to climate change. According to NASA, the past nine years have been the warmest on record.
The cost of electricity to stay cool during the summer is also increasing, as families run their air conditioning systems longer to keep their homes at a safe and comfortable temperature. We estimate that the cost of home energy nationally will increase by 11.7% this summer to an average of $578, up from $517 last summer. And these numbers follow the high cost of heating last winter, putting an enormous financial burden on low-income families.
Indeed, these families are already behind on their home energy bills. Close to 20 million families owe about $19.5 billion on their utility bills. Federal funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides formula grants to states to help pay household heating and cooling bills, is only adequate to help about one out of six eligible households, while just 20% of program funds are used for cooling (the other 80% is used for heating).
And rising temperatures present a public health issue, too, as emergency room visits increase from people suffering from heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion, which can lead to heat stroke. Emissions also increase as families use more electricity to run their air conditioning systems and utilities use more fossil fuels to produce the electricity needed to run those systems.
It’s clear that we need to act now to develop a nationwide framework for climate adaptation to protect all vulnerable families from hotter summers, higher bills and more extreme weather events.
About 34.2 million households are currently income eligible to receive energy bill assistance under the current LIHEAP legislation — according to federal law, households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level, currently $30,000 for a family of four, or 60% of state median income, whichever is greater, are eligible for the program. And while the Inflation Reduction Act provides $4.5 billion for low-income energy efficiency retrofits and a maximum of $14,000 per household, it’s only enough funding to upgrade about 320,000 households — just 1% of the families that will need help.
Opinion: Vacations as we know it are over
States have been taking matters into their own hands, creating clean energy plans that include statewide greenhouse gas reduction goals. But not all state climate plans include specific policies focusing on low-income families.
This piecemeal approach has the potential to create an alarming level of climate inequity, including energy affordability, access to energy efficiency equipment to help transition to rising temperatures and health concerns based on the state in which someone lives. Lack of access to cooling could mean death from heat-related illness.
To address the summer cooling crisis, there are a few things the government can do in the short term:
Suspend shutoffs
Utilities should voluntarily suspend shutoffs this summer for families who are behind on their bills. Maricopa Country, Arizona, for example, has seen at least 18 deaths from heat-related illnesses, while 69 more are under investigation for being heat-related. Only 19 states, including Arizona, plus Washington, DC, have summer shut-off protections in place, and many of those are limited to periods of extreme temperature. Meanwhile, 42 states plus Washington, DC have winter shutoff protections in place.
Additional funding
The National Energy Assistance Directors Association is asking Congress for an additional $3 billion for cooling assistance this year. These additional funds will help six million households pay their cooling bills this summer. Many low-income families have access to cooling — they just can’t afford to turn it on.
Long-term, the nation must develop a strategy to help retrofit the entire low-income housing stock by helping families pay for high-efficiency retrofits that will reduce their energy costs and make their houses more resilient to climate change. The strategy should have a goal of retrofitting the entire low-income housing stock within the next 10 years and set appropriations to address the full need.
Utilities and residential building owners nationwide should be required to protect low-income families during periods of extreme weather. This includes year-round shutoff protection for medically vulnerable households and for all households during extreme weather. It also includes requiring the multi-family building owners to provide access to cooling, the same way they provide access to heating.
We can no longer afford to think about energy assistance as a seasonal need. Extreme hot and cold temperatures and extreme weather events are impacting families across the country in all months of the year. We should better prepare for these crises and develop programs that help low-income families stay safe and in their homes."

Terrified tourists holidaying in the Greek Islands this week came face-to-face with the future.
As wildfires, driven by record-breaking heat, tinder-box conditions and strong winds, raged across the islands of Rhodes, Corfu and Evia, thousands of visitors, along with residents, had to flee the flames — many with just the clothes they were wearing.
It would be a big mistake to regard these as freak events and to continue holidaying as usual in the years ahead. On the contrary, the extreme weather conditions across southern Europe this summer are a wake-up call — a reminder that not even our vacations are insulated from the growing consequences of global heating.
This view is reinforced by a new study published earlier this week which showed that both the European and North American heatwaves would have been all but impossible without climate change.
The plague of heat and fires that our world is experiencing today is one consequence of a 1.2 degrees Celsius hike in the global average temperature, compared to pre-industrial times.
A 2 degrees Celsius rise, which we are currently on target to far exceed by the end of the century, would see the average number of heatwave days increase six-fold across southern Europe — so that 1 in 100-year heatwaves would happen every other year.
Even northern Europe would see a tripling of extreme heat events, which could be expected once every five years.
The reality is that the ongoing heatwaves and wildfires provide us with glimpses of worse to come in the decades ahead as our planet gets ever hotter — but this is not a natural progression, it is a direct result of humankind’s carbon-polluting activities.
Actions have consequences. And a straight line can be drawn from the huge volumes of carbon dioxide pumped out as millions fly off on a summer holiday every year, to the heat, fires and other episodes of extreme weather that now endanger both resorts and those who visit them.
The events of the last week in the Greek Islands should, then, give us pause for thought, not only about whether we should any longer be flying on holiday to places that may threaten us and our loved ones — but about the whole point of having a holiday.
For many of us, jetting off every year on a foreign break has almost become instinctive — just something we do without really thinking about it.
If southern Europe is out of bounds due to increasing heat, then the tendency for many will be to find somewhere else that looks — on the face of it at least — less risky. But this isn’t the answer.
Climate breakdown is set to become all-pervasive and affect every aspect of our lives and livelihoods, and already extreme weather can happen pretty much anywhere. So, what to do?
Last year, UK residents made more than 46 million trips to go on holiday abroad. This can’t go on, nor should it, both for the peace of mind of holiday-makers increasingly worried about growing extreme weather, and for the good of the planet.
Holidays abroad need to be decoupled from flying, which means – as far as Europe is concerned – train, car or coach.
Bill McGuire
Vacations need to return to their roots, or at least move in that direction. In particular, holidays abroad need to be decoupled from flying, which means — as far as Europe is concerned — train, car or coach.
There are issues, of course. A just-published Greenpeace analysis revealed that travelling by train around Europe is, on average, four times more expensive than flying. Travelling by road takes longer, and is likely to involve hours of frustrating queueing at ports.
But on the plus side, the journey itself becomes part of the holiday. Airport scrums and delays are avoided and, most importantly for the climate, carbon emissions are massively reduced.
In any case, the aviation sector is not getting off scot-free as temperatures climb, and delays and cancellations are set to become far more common. As I write this, both Palermo and Catania airports in Sicily are closed because of wildfires. In the US, the impact of extreme heat on aircraft engines, and on the lift the wings provide during take-off, means that planes are having to reduce weight by shedding fuel load, passengers or baggage or wait for temperatures to fall.
Perhaps the solution is to focus on what we really want and need from a holiday — a period of well-earned rest and recuperation that recharges the batteries and sets us up for the next round of the daily grind.
We should ask ourselves if we have to experience the exotic and the unfamiliar to accomplish this — especially when an increased risk to life and limb attaches to holidays in distant lands — or if we can get it closer to home.

Maybe we should take a lesson from the pandemic, when staycations were pretty much enforced. There is so much to marvel at in our own countries, even though its climate is also changing.
The UK, where I live, is far from immune to the wild weather that global heating is driving, as the over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) temperatures and destructive wildfires of last year testify, and severe heatwaves will become more commonplace.
If you like the heat, increasingly you won’t need to travel, it will find you. Nonetheless, the familiarity and convenience of being close to home can bring its own contentment, comfort and well-being.
What’s more, we’ll be able sunbathe in the warm glow of knowing we have slashed the size of our carbon footprint — making us part of the solution rather than the problem."
"Deadly extreme heat is spreading, threatening coral reefs and fueling wildfires that compromise air quality",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/weather/extreme-heat-us-impacts/index.html,"Deadly extreme heat is spreading, threatening coral reefs and fueling wildfires that compromise air quality
Dangerously high temperatures that have already proven deadly in multiple states are expanding as far east as the Northeast, as they also threaten ocean ecosystems and fuel destructive wildfires that emit harmful particulates.
More than 100 million people from California to Massachusetts were under some kind of heat alert Wednesday as extreme temperatures spread across the country. Over the next seven days, 85% of the population will experience temperatures 90 degrees or higher.
The southern tier of the US has been baking for weeks, with places like Phoenix, Miami and El Paso, Texas, continuing to smash record-long extreme-heat streaks Tuesday.
Now it’s the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast’s turn.
Temperatures are forecast to top 100 degrees in places like Kansas City and St. Louis through Friday. As the heat builds into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Thursday and Friday, highs in the upper 90’s could break daily records in places like Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York. High humidity will drive up the heat index there to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
The stifling forecast has pushed Connecticut’s governor to activate the state’s extreme hot weather protocol on Wednesday to provide cooling centers for vulnerable residents.
“We’ve experienced a pretty warm summer so far, but it’s expected to get particularly hot this week, including during the evening hours,” Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said.
And the heat has been affecting everyone: Last month was the hottest June on record dating back to 1850, according to a climate report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
“Globally, June 2023 set a record for the highest monthly sea surface temperature anomaly of any month in NOAA’s 174-year record,” the agency said.  “June heat was not limited to the ocean surface; the Southern Hemisphere had its warmest June on record and the Northern Hemisphere tied 2019 for its warmest June.”
Scientists agree that human-induced climate change is the main culprit causing record high temperatures, which have led to hospitalizations and deaths in the US. Additionally, wildfires burning in Canada and US have been exacerbated by the unrelenting heat, tanking the air quality for many in both countries.
The exceptional heat isn’t confined to land, either. Ocean temperatures around Florida are so high that experts reported severe coral bleaching and a die off at some reefs, which could worsen if the extreme warmth persists.
And before temperatures begin to lessen in some places next week, here are some of the impacts it had on communities in recent weeks.
A fatal heatwave
Dozens of people across Arizona and Nevada have died this year from the physical impacts of extreme heat.
In Arizona’s Maricopa County – home to Phoenix – 25 deaths have been reported to be heat-related so far this year as of Tuesday, the county said in a weekly report. Another 249 deaths are under investigation for whether heat was a cause.
Meanwhile, Clark County in Nevada reported at least 16 heat-related deaths, the county’s coroner told CNN on Tuesday. Las Vegas, located in Clark County, experienced temperatures above 110 degrees for 10 consecutive days, the last of which was Monday.
Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the US, killing more people than hurricanes or tornadoes.
And it also leads to illnesses. Last week, at least 570 hospital visits in Arizona were related to heat-related complications, the state department of health services said.
“Fire departments and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers have reported treating an increasing number of patients for heat-related illness too. These incidents are only the tip of the iceberg. We urge Arizonans to take this extreme heat extremely seriously,” the department said in a statement Tuesday.
“I chose to hike alone, without water, and I did not check the weather. When I returned, I was clammy, shaking, ash gray, had a splitting headache and felt nauseous. It took over a day to recover. Always have plenty of water.” https://t.co/0BOZ4yzAL0 #NMwx pic.twitter.com/PPNhqp2osr
Making matters worse, five people are suspected to have died since June 1 from heat-related causes in national parks – more than an average entire year, park service news releases and preliminary National Park Service data provided to CNN show. No other year had five heat-related deaths by July 23, according to park mortality data dating to 2007.
Wildfires destroy homes, choke air quality
A wildfire in southern Oregon fueled by the heat and strong winds destroyed dozens of homes and outbuildings and also knocked out internet and 911 services in one county.
The so-called Golden Fire burned through 43 homes and 43 outbuildings as it grew to more than 2,000 acres around 11 miles north of Bonanza, Oregon, since July 22. The fire also knocked down more than 100 power poles, blacking out internet and 911 services in Lake County, Oregon, according to a news release from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.
Nearby Klamath County, Oregon, was handling 911 calls in the meantime.
The fire was one of several also degrading air quality across the country. As of Tuesday, there were nine wildfires in each of Arizona and New Mexico, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
Also, smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning across Canada continued to waft south, tanking air quality and polluting air in Chicago and Detroit. Both cities were among the 10 top cities with the worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, with Chicago ranking fifth and Detroit ninth as of early Wednesday morning.
“Today, air quality in the City of Detroit will be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (AQI Orange) range,” the Detroit health department said Tuesday. “The air quality is being impacted by the presence of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5).”
In addition to the poor air quality, Detroit is also facing extreme heat this week, when some areas are expected to feel as hot as 99 degrees Thursday and Friday, according to the city’s National Weather Service.
“Very hot and muggy conditions are likely later this week with heat index values approaching 100 degrees,” the weather service said on Twitter.
Extreme heat impacts oceanic ecosystem
The consequences of dangerously high temperatures have stretched beyond land.
The record-breaking heatwave led to surging water temperatures off Florida’s coast, where multiple reefs around the Keys area are currently completely bleached or dead.
The mass bleaching event unfolded in two weeks, according to coral experts, who said they expect the “complete mortality” of the bleached reefs in just a week.
Because it is extremely sensitive to temperature changes, experiencing too much heat for too long causes coral to bleach and turn white as they expel their algal food source and slowly starve to death.
The water is typically in mid-80s in the region, but experts have recorded 90-degree temperatures, according to Cynthia Lewis, who heads the Keys Marine Laboratory at the Florida Institute of Oceanography.
“It is very alarming,” she said in a news release.
Teams from the University of South Florida and the Florida Institute of Oceanography Keys Marine Laboratory conducted a rescue mission for more than 1,500 corals by harvesting them from at risk sites and bringing them into a temperature controlled laboratory.
Sweltering temperatures are also posing a risk to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, a vital system of ocean currents which includes the Gulf Stream.
A study published Tuesday in the journal Nature found the current may collapse around the middle of the century or as early as 2025.
The AMOC is a complex tangle of currents that works like a giant global conveyor belt. It transports warm water from the tropics toward the North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southwards.
It plays a crucial role in the climate system, helping regulate global weather patterns. Its collapse would have significant implications, including much more extreme winters and sea level rises affecting parts of Europe and the US as well as a shifting of the monsoon in the tropics.
Scientists uninvolved with the study told CNN the exact tipping point for the critical system is uncertain, and that measurements of the currents have so far showed little trend or change. But they agreed these results are alarming and provide new evidence that the tipping point could occur sooner than previously thought.

A vital system of ocean currents could collapse within a few decades if the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution, scientists are warning – an event that would be catastrophic for global weather and “affect every person on the planet.”
A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature, found that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current – of which the Gulf Stream is a part – could collapse around the middle of the century, or even as early as 2025.
Scientists uninvolved with this study told CNN the exact tipping point for the critical system is uncertain, and that measurements of the currents have so far showed little trend or change. But they agreed these results are alarming and provide new evidence that the tipping point could occur sooner than previously thought.
The AMOC is a complex tangle of currents that works like a giant global conveyor belt. It transports warm water from the tropics toward the North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southwards.
It plays a crucial role in the climate system, helping regulate global weather patterns. Its collapse would have enormous implications, including much more extreme winters and sea level rises affecting parts of Europe and the US, and a shifting of the monsoon in the tropics.
For years, scientists have been warning of its instability as the climate crisis accelerates, threatening to upset the balance of temperature and salinity on which the strength of these currents depend.
As the oceans heat up and ice melts, more freshwater flows into the ocean and reduces the water’s density, making it less able to sink. When waters become too fresh, too warm or both, the conveyor belt stops.
It has happened before. More than 12,000 years ago, rapid glacier melt caused the AMOC to shut down, leading to huge Northern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations of 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (18 to 27 Fahrenheit) within a decade.
A shutdown “would affect every person on the planet – it’s that big and important,” said Peter de Menocal, the president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.
A 2019 report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the AMOC would weaken over this century, but that its full collapse before 2100 was unlikely.
This new study comes to a much more alarming conclusion.
As the AMOC has only been continuously monitored since 2004, the study authors looked to a much larger dataset, and one which could show how the currents behaved in a period without human-caused climate change.
“We needed to go back in time,” said Peter Ditlevsen, a professor of climate physics at the University of Copenhagen and one of the authors of the report. The scientists analyzed sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in an area south of Greenland over a period of 150 years between 1870 and 2020.
This part of the ocean is warmed by the water transported north from the tropics by the AMOC, Ditlevsen said, “so if it cools, it’s because the AMOC is weakening.” The authors then subtracted the impacts of human-caused global warming on the water temperature to understand how the currents were changing.
They found “early warning signals” of critical changes in the AMOC, which led them to predict “with high confidence” that it could shut down or collapse as early as 2025 and no later than 2095. The likeliest point of collapse is somewhere between 2039 and 2070, Ditlevsen said.
“It’s really scary,” he told CNN. “This is not something you would lightly put into papers,” he said, adding, “we’re very confident that this is a robust result.”
De Menocal said the study results were “both surprising and alarming.”
It’s been clear for a while that the AMOC will weaken in the coming decades, he told CNN. In 2021, a study found the AMOC was showing signs of instability due to climate change.
But until now, we haven’t had a time frame.
The new study “provides a novel analysis that focuses on when the AMOC tipping point will occur,” de Menocal said, and the study’s prediction the collapse will occur around 2050 “is alarmingly soon given the globally disruptive impact of such an event.” Although, he added, it is important to note that there is no observational evidence yet that the AMOC is collapsing.
Stefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at the University of Potsdam in Germany, who was also not involved in the study, said the research helps bolster previous research.
“There is still large uncertainty where the tipping point of the AMOC is, but the new study adds to the evidence that it is much closer than we thought just a few years ago,” he told CNN. “The scientific evidence now is that we can’t even rule out crossing a tipping point already in the next decade or two.”
The report calls for fast and effective measures to cut planet-heating pollution to zero, to reduce global temperatures and slow melting in the Arctic.
“The key point of this study is that we don’t have much time at all to do this,” de Menocal said. “And the stakes just got higher.”"
"Heat waves in US and Europe would have been ‘virtually impossible’ without climate change, new report finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/world/heat-wave-climate-change-us-china-europe-intl/index.html,"Heat waves in US and Europe would have been ‘virtually impossible’ without climate change, new report finds
Extreme heat waves across three continents this month were made significantly more likely by the human-caused climate crisis, according to a new analysis released Tuesday as temperatures are still blazing in parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
The “heat hell” searing parts of the United States and southern Europe would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, while climate change made China’s heat wave at least 50 times more likely, according to a rapid attribution analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative.
The WWA, a group of international scientists who assess the role of climate change in extreme weather events, spent a week analyzing the dangerous heat waves that have swept the Northern Hemisphere in July, destroying crops and livestock, triggering wildfires, exacerbating water stress and killing people across three continents.
Temperatures in Death Valley reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit (53.3 Celsius) this month and the city of Phoenix has experienced a record-smashing 25 consecutive days of temperatures hotter than 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius).
China posted an all-time national high temperature at 52.2 degrees Celsius (126 Fahrenheit) earlier this month. And in Europe, local records were broken across parts of Spain and Italy as temperatures edged towards Europe’s all-time record of 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 Fahrenheit).
To understand the extent to which the climate crisis affected the likelihood and intensity of this July’s extreme heat, the WWA team examined weather data and computer models to compare the world’s current climate – which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial era – with the climate of the past.
They found that “the role of climate change is absolutely overwhelming,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London.
If humans hadn’t heated the planet by burning oil, coal and gas, these kinds of blistering heat waves would be extremely rare, Otto told reporters on Monday. But, as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, they are no longer unusual, she said.
In today’s climate, extreme heat waves like those the world is currently experiencing are expected once every 15 years for the US and Mexico, once every 10 years in Southern Europe and once every five years for China, the analysis found.
The scientists found that climate change not only drastically increased the likelihood of these heat waves happening, but it is also making them hotter.
Planet-heating pollution made Europe’s heat wave 2.5 degrees Celsius hotter, the North American heat wave 2 degrees Celsius hotter and China’s heatwave 1 degree Celsius hotter, according to the report.
Worse could be in store. If the planet’s average temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, extreme heat waves can be expected every two to five years, according to the report.
“It could well be that this is what will be a cool summer in the future, if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels rapidly,” Otto said.
The scientists said that the developing El Niño, the natural climate pattern with a warming impact, likely helped push up temperatures a little – but that global warming from burning fossil fuels was the main reason the heatwaves are so severe.
“The result of this attribution study is not surprising. The world hasn’t stopped burning fossil fuels, the climate continues to warm and heatwaves continue to become more extreme. It is that simple,” said Otto in a statement.
But the study should not be interpreted as evidence of “runaway warming” or “climate collapse,” she added.
“We still have time to secure a safe and healthy future, but we urgently need to stop burning fossil fuels and invest in decreasing vulnerability. If we do not, tens of thousands of people will keep dying from heat-related causes each year.”
Heat waves are one of the deadliest natural hazards. More than 61,000 people died of heat-related deaths during Europe’s record-breaking heat wave last year, according to a recent  study.
In Mexico, more than 100 people have died due to heat since March, while countries from the US to Italy have reported steep jumps in hospital admissions as people struggle to cope with soaring temperatures.
Society must rapidly reduce planet-heating pollution, the report authors said. But they also called on countries and cities to adapt health, urban planning and energy systems, as well as accelerating the roll-out of heat action plans to better prepare for the extreme heat the climate crisis has already locked in.
Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading in the UK who was not involved in the study, said fluctuating weather patterns determined the location and timing of these heat waves.
“But warming of the climate is promoting moderate heat waves to top off the league extremes and what would have been top of the league heat waves into events impossible in a climate without the heating effects of fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions.”"
$4.6 billion plant in South Africa will make ‘the fuel of the future’,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/africa/green-ammonia-hive-energy-scn-climate-spc-intl/index.html,"$4.6 billion plant in South Africa will make ‘the fuel of the future’
In Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, thousands of hectares of land could one day become the world’s largest green ammonia plant.
Ammonia, which is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen, is commonly used as a fertilizer. In the early 1910s scientists devised a way to synthesize it, but before then, the main agricultural fertilizer was guano, bat or bird excrement, which had to be obtained from tropical islands and was in short supply.
Production of ammonia at an industrial scale allowed agriculture to boom, and according to a study from the University of Manitoba, without it, we wouldn’t be able to produce roughly half of the world’s food today.
Ammonia is also used to manufacture explosives for the mining industry and is a key ingredient in many pharmaceutical and cleaning products. Currently, its production mainly involves fossil fuels and is responsible for 1.8% of global CO2 emissions. But by using renewable energy, “green” ammonia can be manufactured, slashing the carbon footprint of agricultural production and opening up the compound to further uses.
Prominent among them is the use of ammonia as fuel, which could help decarbonize the shipping sector. It is what the Mandela Bay plant will focus on. “It’ll start replacing heavy fuel oils on ships and it’ll replace diesel. That will become the fuel of the future, particularly in the maritime industry,” says Colin Loubser, managing director of Hive Energy Africa, which is building the plant.
‘A completely green process’
The process to make green ammonia is quite simple, Loubser says, requiring just water, air and energy. Electrolysis is used to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen, and an air separation unit extracts nitrogen from the air. The hydrogen and nitrogen are then combined to produce ammonia.
“The process of making it green is that you’re using renewable energy for this. You’re not using fossil fuels, coal or gas to make it. It’s a completely green process,” says Loubser.
Projected to start operations in 2026, the plant will cost $4.6 billion. It will be powered by a nearby solar farm and will get its water — of which vast amounts are needed to make ammonia — from a local table salt factory that desalinates seawater.
At least 20,000 jobs will be created in the region over the lifespan of the project, according to Loubser.
It will be a welcome development for the area. “We were hit very hard by Covid,” says Asanda Xawuka of the Coega Development Corporation, the entity in charge of bringing employment to the region. “A number of jobs were lost in South Africa. For us in the Eastern Cape, the unemployment rate is sitting at over 50%. (This) means an investment of this nature with a number of jobs that are going to be created, it’s going to be very big.”
The shipping industry made up nearly 3% of global CO2 emissions in 2018. According to the International Energy Agency, ammonia will need to account for 45% of the global energy demand for shipping in 2050, for net zero scenarios to realize, which means it’s an essential component of a greener future. But green ammonia could also be burned in existing coal-fired power plants to quickly reduce their CO2 emissions, the study notes, or in plants customized to run entirely on ammonia.
One limiting factor is that ammonia is a pungent and toxic gas, so it needs to be handled by trained professionals. Using it as a fuel produces nitrogen oxides, which can act as greenhouse gases and cause air pollution, requiring additional technology to control emissions.
And many of the systems that will make use of green ammonia – including ship engines – are still under development, which is why production levels are low at the moment. However, production is expected to boom: according to a report by Precedence Research, the green ammonia market accounted for just $36 million in 2021, but will grow to $5.4 billion by 2030."
"2024 will probably be hotter than this year because of El Niño, NASA scientists say",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/us/2024-hotter-than-2023-el-nino-nasa-climate/index.html,"2024 will probably be hotter than this year because of El Niño, NASA scientists say
As millions bake under a relentless heat wave in the South and Southwest US – and as temperatures soar around the Northern Hemisphere – NASA scientists warned Thursday that we haven’t even seen the worst of El Niño and next year will likely be even warmer for the planet.
Climate change, caused by burning fossil fuels, is unequivocally warming the Earth’s temperature, NASA scientists said.
And El Niño, the natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific that brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and influences weather, has only just started in recent months and therefore is not having a huge impact yet on the extreme heat people around the globe are experiencing this summer, said Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
“It’s really only just emerged, and so what we’re seeing is not really due to that El Niño,” Schmidt told reporters. “What we’re seeing is the overall warmth pretty much everywhere – particularly in the oceans. … The reason why we think that’s going to continue is because we continue to put greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Until we stop doing that, temperatures will keep on rising.”
Last month was the hottest June on record for the planet, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service reported earlier this month. Several days in July were the planet’s warmest in modern records kept by two climate agencies in the US and Europe.
All of that heat is adding up, and Schmidt said he believes there is a 50-50 chance that 2023 will be the warmest year on record.
But, he added, it is likely that a sweltering 2024 will exceed it, precisely because of El Niño’s influence.
“We anticipate that 2024 is going to be an even warmer year because we’re going to be starting off with that El Niño event,” Schmidt said. “That will peak towards the end of this year, and how big that is is going to have a big impact on the following year’s statistics.”
Scientists also discussed the devastating impact climate change is having on the Earth’s oceans, as North Atlantic Ocean temperatures have soared this summer.
“The oceans are running a fever,” said Carlos Del Castillo, chief of NASA’s Ocean Ecology Laboratory. “This issue with ocean temperature is not a problem that stays in the ocean – it affects everything else.” Castillo noted hotter ocean temperatures can make hurricanes stronger and make ocean levels rice due to glacial melt.
Schmidt noted that rising temperatures are in line with what scientists have predicted as humans burn more fossil fuels and pump more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
“Even the things that are unprecedented are not surprising,” Schmidt said."

We can’t air-condition our way out of America’s heat crisis
Extreme heat in the summer has become America’s brutal new reality. But local, state and federal aid programs and infrastructure to help people cool down haven’t kept up with the country’s record-shattering temperatures.
Climate, energy and urban researchers are urging policymakers to implement solutions to mitigate the danger of heat on vulnerable residents and design cooler cities and towns for a hotter future.
“There is no national plan to help lower-income families to transition to higher temperatures,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, which represents state energy assistance programs for low-income Americans. “The solutions we have are based on shorter heat waves and more temperate summers. Public policy hasn’t caught up.”
Wolfe is calling for congressional funding to retrofit low-income homes for cooling. This effort would pay for energy-efficient air conditioning equipment and insulation. It would also include building code changes that require multi-family homes provide cooling the same way they do heating.
Last year, Chicago passed a law requiring certain new and existing residential buildings to install air conditioners in indoor common areas, and Los Angeles is exploring an air conditioner requirement for all rental units.
But that won’t be enough to keep people cool as temperatures rise.
Cities are warmer than their surrounding areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, and they need to be better designed to keep people cool, researchers say. This will require investments in urban trees, forests and infrastructure.
That means planting more trees and building shade structures; so-called cool roofs and streets with reflective surfaces to lower temperatures; and updated building codes.
“We can’t just air condition our way out of the problem,” said Rushad Nanavatty, managing director of RMI, a clean energy think tank that is part of the Cool Coalition, a United Nations-led effort to address urban cooling. “We don’t view urban nature as infrastructure, but that’s exactly what it is. We spend an order of magnitude less on it than we should if you consider the full range of benefits.”
Beating the heat
Underfunded energy assistance programs and poorly designed urban areas put low-income, elderly and other vulnerable Americans most at risk when temperatures spike.
Most low-income families have access to cooling in their homes, but they lack the money to turn it on, costing them an average of 8.6% of their income to pay for home energy — three times that of higher-income families, according to the US Department of Energy.
And prices will rise this summer by 11.7% to an average of $578, up from $517 last summer, according to the NEADA.
Heat is a major public health concern, but its priority in federal and state assistance programs is not proportionate.
Heat kills more Americans every year than any other weather-related disaster. Each year, an average of more than 700 people die from heat and more than 9,000 people are hospitalized nationally due to heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But experts say the death tolls and hospitalization rates are vastly under-counted.
“Extreme heat hasn’t been thought of in the same vain as other disasters and emergency situations,” said Nanavatty. “Extreme heat is an increasing emergency, but our response isn’t there.”
Take, for example, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides formula grants to states to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills.
About 80% of the program’s funding is used by states to help families pay their heating bills, Mark Wolfe said, leaving little money left for families to pay for cooling bills in the summer.
Additionally, fewer states have protections against power shutoffs during the summer than they do for heating in the winter.
Twenty states and Washington, DC, bar certain utility companies from disconnecting customers for nonpayment during extreme heat, while 40 states have cutoff protections during the winter.
“The programs are rooted in cold weather. They were designed 40 years ago when summer temperatures were much cooler,” Mark Wolfe said. “Our approach toward cooling is much weaker than our approach toward heating.”
His organization has called for increased funding for LIHEAP, which only helps one out of six households who are eligible, and a national moratorium on shutting families off from power this summer.
Public health departments and governments often run cooling centers in schools or other air-conditioned buildings when temperatures rise, but there are limitations to these centers.
A study published last year by the CDC found that in two counties in Arizona, Maricopa and Yuma, “several barriers inhibit cooling center use, including the inability to bring pets and limited access by public transportation.”
Most places also do not open cooling centers unless the temperature rises to a certain level.
New York City, for example, has not opened its cooling centers because the National Weather Service hasn’t issued a heat advisory. But the city’s health department recorded nearly 150 heat-related emergency room visits over a two week stretch in July, compared to 20 last year.
Solutions
Cities need to expand their definitions of cooling centers to movie theaters, shopping malls, parks, transit hubs and other conveniently-located areas, researchers say, and keep them open for longer.
Cities can also provide more shade for residents and design cool roofs and streets to protect people from extreme heat.
“Cities themselves contribute to heat and how a person experiences heat waves,” said V. Kelly Turner, an assistant professor of urban planning and geography at UCLA. “The two big way cities are trying to address heat are through shade and reflective surfaces — cool pavements and cool roofs.”
Pavements and roofs comprise over 60% of urban surfaces, and cities can require new buildings and surfaces to use materials that lighten the surface color of roofs and streets to reflect, not absorb, sunlight.
Trees and vegetation also lower surface and air temperatures. Shaded surfaces, for example, may be 20 to 45 degrees cooler than the peak temperatures of unshaded materials, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Vegetation is most useful as a heat mitigation strategy when it is planted in strategic locations around buildings or to shade pavement in parking lots and on streets.
In Miami-Dade County, the city has an initiative to cover 30% of the county with tree canopies.
“How do we make people feel cooler — the most effective way we can do that is shade,” said Turner.

Traveling to a heat wave zone: Here’s what tourists need to know,https://www.cnn.com/travel/heatwave-travel-tourist-advice-explainer/index.html,"Traveling to a heat wave zone: Here’s what tourists need to know
Scorching hot temperatures have been breaking records and wreaking havoc across some of the world’s most popular tourism destinations.
Is it time to rethink travel plans? Are refunds available? Are there ways to cope?
Here are some answers to many of the key questions travelers may be asking when potentially dangerous conditions are likely to affect their vacation.
Which regions are affected?
A number of destinations across the United States, Europe and Asia have been significantly impacted by soaring global temperatures.
In the US, temperatures in Death Valley, which runs along part of central California’s border with Nevada and is known as “the hottest place on Earth,” reached 128 Fahrenheit (53.3 Celsius) on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.
Travelers in Texas and Florida have also been faced with especially hot weather in recent weeks, while temperatures in Phoenix jumped to 114 F at the weekend. Tuesday marked the 19th-consecutive day a reading of 110 F or more was recorded in the capital of Arizona.
In Europe, health warnings have been issued by officials in countries such as Italy and France due to the extreme weather.
Italy’s health ministry has issued red weather alerts, which signal a potential health threat for those exposed to the heat, in at least 23 cities as temperatures on Tuesday reached 112 F (44 C) in Sardinia and 104 F (40 C) in Rome.
Several tourists have collapsed due to heat stroke, including a British citizen who passed out near the ancient Roman Colosseum on Tuesday.
The heat has also been intensifying in Spain, where an extreme warning has been issued in popular holiday spot Mallorca as temperatures are predicted to reach up to 109 F (43 C) .
Wildfires have been burning in La Palma, located in the Canary Islands, which has seen up to 4,000 people evacuated from their homes.
Last week, the Greek Culture Ministry went as far as to shut the Acropolis in Athens from midday local time until 5 p.m. as a result of the heat, and authorities have suggested that temperatures could top 111.2 F (44 C) by the end of the week.
China recorded its highest temperature ever on Sunday, as the extreme weather led to the heat soaring to nearly 126 F (52 C) in northwestern Xinjiang province.
It’s not just the heatwave. There’s now another reason your summer vacation might be ruined
How bad is it?
Global temperature records have been continually broken in recent weeks as the hottest days ever are logged, and this seems likely to continue as the heat intensifies in numerous countries around the world.
According to preliminary figures from the World Meteorological Organization, June saw the warmest global average temperature on record, and this has continued into July.
“The extreme weather – an increasingly frequent occurrence in our warming climate – is having a major impact on human health, ecosystems, economies, agriculture, energy and water supplies,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas.
“This underlines the increasing urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and as deeply as possible.”
While there’s no denying that summers are hot in cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, current temperatures appear to be higher than usual, and the heat waves are certainly becoming more intense.
In 2022, the hottest day recorded in Phoenix was July 15, when temperatures soared to around 114 F. However, current predictions suggest that this will be exceeded as the city marks 19 days of temperatures of around 110 F or more.
Meanwhile, temperatures are predicted to reach close to 120 F (48.9 C) in either Sicily or Sardinia in the coming days, which would smash Europe’s hottest-ever logged temperature, thought to be 119.8 F (48.8 C), which was recorded near Syracuse on the coast of Sicily in August 2021.
Is it safe to travel to a heat wave zone?
If you’re planning to visit one of the affected destinations, whether for leisure or business, it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to stick to your original travel plans.
In areas with scorching temperatures, travelers may struggle to sightsee at their usual pace and may need to adapt or scrap itineraries. This will be even more important for people with chronic health conditions or in high-risk categories, such as older people and young children.
Anyone visiting an area at risk of floods, wildfire or typhoons could potentially find tourist destinations closed or even being evacuated. It’s important to pay very close attention to local government safety advice and heed recommendations.
While many vacations will be possible so long as advice is followed and precautions are taken, in certain circumstances it may be advisable to cancel or reschedule your trips.
Opinion: ‘A nasty smell that lingers in the nostrils.’ What it’s really like inside Italy’s hellish heatwave
What can I do to cope with the heat?
Try to get out and about first thing in the morning – the temperatures start building at around 11 a.m. Although conventional wisdom suggests that midday is the hottest time of the day, in reality, the heat keeps building until early evening – and temperatures in the afternoon are far more suffocating than in the morning.
Wash hands and wrists – and ideally face and arms – with cool water as often as possible (in Europe, fountains should make this easy). Take cool showers when you can, and try to air-dry if possible. Italian authorities are advising residents to spend at least three hours a day in an air-conditioned environment – so if you’re sightseeing, find a cool museum, gallery or restaurant to take refuge in.
Wear loose, light clothing made of lightweight materials. Don’t forget sunscreen – and reapply it regularly. And use a fan – yes, even a handheld one can make a huge difference in how you feel.
Drink more water than usual, the CDC advises, and don’t wait until you feel thirsty to drink.
When it’s time to eat, prioritize water-filled foods – raw vegetables and salads, or fruits such as watermelon or grapes.
If you’re asthmatic, or have other chronic health conditions that can be worsened by heat or humidity, it’s worth seeking medical advice about how best to tackle your trip.
Check whether the place you’re staying has air conditioning – if you fall into a high risk category, that will be crucial.
Finally, make sure you have travel insurance that covers medical expenses. That way, if you need treatment for heat-related illnesses, you’ll be covered. If you’re in a high-risk category and your doctor advises you not to travel, you should be able to cancel on insurance, too.
What are the health risks?
Health risks are potentially very severe, although some people will just experience discomfort.
Extreme heat can cause a number of medical issues that can be serious or even lead to death. Nearly 62,000 people are reported to have died heat-related deaths during 2022’s Europe-wide heat wave. In the US, more than 700 people die from extreme heat annually, according to the CDC.
Heat stroke and heat exhaustion are the biggest risks. If you see any of the symptoms below, the CDC advises seeking immediate medical attention.
Heat stroke symptoms include a body temperature over 103 Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius), hot and red skin without sweating, headaches and dizziness, upset stomachs and passing out. Sufferers should cool with fanning and cool water on the skin rather than take in more fluids, according to the CDC.
Heat exhaustion is marked by heavy sweating, muscle cramps, exhaustion and pale skin. Sufferers can also have headaches, dizziness, upset stomachs and can faint. The CDC outlines (pdf) steps to take to treat heat-related illness symptoms while you await medical attention.
Those with chronic health conditions, as well as older people, young children and infants are at higher risk.
Anyone with asthma or other breathing difficulties should be aware that it’s not just wildfires that can worsen their condition. Humidity – as seen in much of Europe, particularly Italy – can have the same effect.
Is transport affected?
Pretty much all transport can be affected by extreme temperatures and in surprising ways. A heat wave can lead to passengers being bumped off their scheduled flight because the plane has become too heavy to take off.
Train tracks and even roads can buckle in extreme heat – in 2022, preventative measures in London included painting rail tracks white and wrapping a bridge in foil. Highways may be blocked off in areas that are prone to flash flooding or at risk of wildfires. Pipe bursts can also increase in dry, hot weather due to ground shifts, leading to yet more unexpected diversions.
Even if your journey on public transport proceeds on schedule, you could be in for a very sticky trip if the buses or trains in your destination don’t have air conditioning – or it breaks down. If you have to hit the road, make sure you have plenty of water and appropriate snacks and be prepared for things not going according to plan.
Can I get a refund if I cancel?
As with most meteorological events, heat waves are not typically covered by travel insurance companies and so no compensation will be offered if you cancel your trip because of rising temperatures.
The situation would change if an official advisory was issued warning against travel, but that’s highly unlikely and many insurance policies do not cover natural catastrophes. There may be some provision for people with pre-existing medical conditions exacerbated by heat.
That said, if the heat causes cancelation of flights or delays, some level of assistance may be offered. Likewise airlines may offer refunds or rescheduling/rerouting options.
Depending on who it’s been booked with and what payments have been made, some hotel stays may be cancelable without incurring any charges. It’s worth checking terms and conditions.
Italy issues ‘extreme’ health warning for 16 cities as heat wave grips Europe
Do Europeans have AC?
When it’s scorching outside, the cooling blast of air conditioning is a much-welcomed source of relief. But while in the US it’s normal for many homes, hotels, restaurants and public buildings to be equipped with aircon, in Europe it’s less common.
A 2018 study from the International Energy Agency found less than 10% of households in Europe have AC, compared to 90% in the US. So if you’re staying in an Airbnb, don’t expect an aircon unit unless it’s specified in the listing. European buildings are also often older than their US counterparts, and were built to to keep heat in, leading to uncomfortable conditions in soaring temperatures.
European hotels are more likely to have cooling systems, but it still depends on the size of the property. Expect AC in larger hotels in cities, but it’s less likely in a small beachside bolthole.
Public transport is also hit and miss. Unsurprisingly, underground lines are often some of the hottest spots in a heat wave – although some have aircon. It’s worth planning ahead – travel app Citymapper, for example, allows users to specify public transport routes with air conditioning.
Aircon is usually found in European cinemas – certainly larger multiplexes. With two of the biggest movies of the year released at the height of 2023 summer heat wave – “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” – this could be a good option for heat relief.
At least 1 person was treated for ‘heat-related discomfort’ in a plane at a Las Vegas airport
How long will it last?
If you’re hoping to travel in August and banking on the weather cooling off by then, it’s worth keeping a close eye on updates. At present, there doesn’t seem to be any guarantee the global heat wave will wane any time soon.
The latest update from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) states there “is no immediate respite in sight” in Europe.”
The same update said “a further continuation into August is possible.”
In the southwestern United States, what the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center terms the “threatening heat” will continue until at least July 28, with high temperatures also hitting the south-central and Southeast of the US.

"Is this extreme weather the ‘new normal?’ There’s no such thing, some scientists say",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/19/world/extreme-weather-heat-floods-abnormal-climate-scn/index.html,"Is this extreme weather the ‘new normal?’ There’s no such thing, some scientists say
Summer in the Northern Hemisphere is playing out like an apocalypse movie: a tale of heat, floods and fire. But scientists warn this may only be a preview of the unpredictable chaos to come if the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution.
Just over halfway through July and already a slew of extreme weather records has been broken.
A prolonged, unrelenting heat wave has scorched large parts of the South and Southwest United States. Temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona, have hit at least 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3C) for a record-breaking 19 consecutive days, and emergency departments are flooded with heat-related illness.
Southern Europe is experiencing one of its most extreme heat waves on record, with wildfires raging in Greece, Spain and Switzerland. And in Asia, temperatures have pushed above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in China, while parts of South Korea, Japan and northern India are experiencing deadly flooding.
In a statement on Tuesday, Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, called this relentless cascade of extreme weather “the new normal.”
But some scientists now baulk at that framing.
“When I hear it, I get a bit crazy because it’s not really the new normal,” said Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK. “Until we stop pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we have no idea what the future looks like.”
She is one of many scientists who warn that, while this summer is very bad, it’s only just the beginning. As long as global temperature continues to rise, they said, the world should brace for escalating impacts.
Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist and distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania, prefers to describe the weather we are seeing as “the new abnormal.”
The new normal “wrongly conveys the idea that we’ve simply arrived in some new climate state and that we simply have to adapt to it,” he told CNN.
“But it’s much worse than that. The impacts become worse and worse as fossil fuel burning and warming continues. It’s a shifting baseline of ever-more devastating impacts as long as the Earth continues to warm.”
For scientists like Mann and Cloke, this year’s extreme weather has largely not been surprising. The development of El Niño, a natural phenomenon that has a global warming impact, layered on top of longterm, human-caused global warming, was expected to have a big impact.
But regionally, there have been “some remarkable anomalies,” said Mann, who pointed to record-low levels of winter sea ice in Antarctica and “off the charts” heat in the North Atlantic. “They are a reminder that we can not only expect to see records broken, but shattered, if we continue burning fossil fuels.”
As the climate crisis accelerates, the stage is set for more surprises.
“The weather extremes will continue to become more intense and our weather patterns could change in ways we yet can’t predict,” said Peter Stott, a science fellow in climate attribution, at the UK Met Office.
In some cases, the heat, fire and floods are already exceeding what climate models have predicted, Mann said. In part, this is due to changes in the jet stream, he said.
The jet stream is driven by the temperature difference between the poles and the equator. As the Arctic rapidly warms, that temperature difference reduces and the jet stream slows and weakens. This can mean that weather systems can get locked into place for prolonged periods.
“The same region gets baked day after day, or rained on day after day – just the sort of behavior we’re seeing this summer,” Mann said.
It will be hard for countries to adapt to these new extremes, said Vikki Thompson, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. “We will see combinations of events that could lead to unexpected impacts. Extreme heat could be quickly followed by heavy rainfall impacting society, agriculture, and ecosystems in unusual ways,” she told CNN.
Countries tend to prepare for the worst they have experienced, but with climate extremes smashing current records, “we need to be prepared for situations that might currently appear impossible,” Thompson said.
While the world is already locked into some impacts of global warming, due to the global failure to cut planet-heating pollution, scientists are clear that there is still time to avert the worst consequences.
The latest science shows that global temperature rise would halt almost immediately after we stop burning fossil fuels, Mann said.
And this summer is more evidence that every fraction of a degree by which the world is able to limit global heating will count, Cloke told CNN. The planet is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before the industrial revolution – still short of the 1.5 degrees scientists are warning the planet should stay under. But even now, the consequences are deadly and far-reaching.
“It is really frightening,” she said. “But the more action that we take, the sooner that we take that action, the better our future will be.”

‘This is just the beginning’: Extreme heat around the world as fires rage in southern Europe,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/europe/europe-weather-second-heatwave-charon-climate-intl/index.html,"‘This is just the beginning’: Extreme heat around the world as fires rage in southern Europe
Blisteringly high temperatures are expected to continue across parts of southern Europe this week, as the continent braces for its second extreme heat wave, putting people’s health at risk and setting the stage for wildfires.
Last week’s “Cerberus” heat wave is making way for another, which Italian weather forecasters have named “Charon” – the ferryman in Greek mythology who carries souls to the underworld.
Italy, Spain and Greece have already faced unrelenting heat for days, but the European Space Agency has warned that the heat wave is only just beginning. In Italy, which has been particularly hard hit, temperatures in many cities are expected to soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading, compared the effect to that of a giant oven over the Mediterranean.
“The bubble of hot air that has inflated over southern Europe has turned Italy and surrounding countries into a giant pizza oven,” she said in a statement Monday.
“The hot air which pushed in from Africa is now staying put, with settled high pressure conditions meaning that heat in warm sea, land and air continues to build,” Cloke explained.
Extreme heat is being felt around the world, with the head of the World Health Organization on Monday urging world leaders to “act now” on the climate crisis.
“In many parts of the world, today is predicted to be the hottest day on record,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet on Monday. “The #ClimateCrisis is not a warning. It’s happening. I urge world leaders to ACT now,” he also said.
High temperatures hit 52.2 degrees Celsius (126 Fahrenheit) on Sunday in northwest China. While in the US, California’s Death Valley reached nearly 52 degrees Celsius (125.6) on Sunday.
Just the beginning
As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, scientists are clear that extreme weather events such as heat waves will only become more frequent and more intense.
Global temperatures have already risen 1.2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels due to humans burning planet-heating fossil fuels.
“This is just the beginning,” said Simon Lewis, the chair of global change science at the University College London.
“Current policies globally have us hitting 2.7 degrees (Celsius) warming by 2100. That’s truly terrifying,” Lewis said in a statement.
“As scientists agreed last year: There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Deep, rapid and sustained cuts in carbon emissions to net zero can halt the warming, but humanity will have to adapt to even more severe heatwaves in the future.” he said.
Last month was the planet’s hottest June on record by a substantial margin, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, accompanied by record high ocean temperatures and record low levels of Antarctic ice.
That unprecedented heat has continued into this month. The first week of July was the hottest week on record, according to preliminary data from the World Meteorological Organization, putting the planet into what Christopher Hewitt, WMO climate services director, described as “uncharted territory.”
Extreme heat is among the deadliest weather phenomena.
Chris Hilson, the director of the University of Reading’s Centre for Climate and Justice, noted “news reports from tourist hotspots like the Acropolis and Rome have tended to make this extreme weather event seem merely like a summer holiday inconvenience.”
However, he said, the reality is that “these heatwaves often lead to many premature deaths, especially among the elderly.”
“This is a matter of climate justice or fairness because climate harms such as extreme heat are being unequally felt,” Hilson said, and “we must ensure that we continue to cut polluting emissions of carbon dioxide to prevent these events from becoming even more frequent; but the authorities also need to put adaptation measures in place with an eye on these unequally felt harms.”
These measures include “cool zones or drop-in centres with transport to get there, more trees in relevant residential neighbourhoods, and appropriate (and preferably renewable-powered) aircon in care homes,” Hilson added.
Climbing temperatures in Italy, Greece and Spain
As a high pressure anticyclone pushes up from North Africa, temperatures in Europe are expected to come close to, or even breach, the continent’s record of 48.8 degrees Celsius (118.4 degrees Fahrenheit) set in 2021, according to the ESA.
The peak of Italy’s heat will be between Monday and Wednesday, according to Italian weather news service Meteo.it, with temperatures expected to climb above 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures will remain high at night meaning there will be little respite from the heat.
Italian authorities have advised people to drink plenty of water, eat lighter meals and avoid direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m.
In Greece, where temperatures have risen above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), authorities were forced to close the Acropolis in Athens, from noon to 5pm local time on Friday and again over the weekend.
In Spain, temperatures in the cities of Seville, Cordoba and Granada have reached 40 degrees Celsius. Even the normally cooler region of Navarra in the north of the country is experiencing up to 40 degrees Celsius.
The heat has also helped prime the land for fires.
Wildfires on the island of La Palma in Spain’s Canary Islands, which started on Saturday morning, have burned through 4,650 hectares (11,490 acres), destroying 20 houses and forcing the emergency evacuation of thousands of people, according to a Reuters report.
Fires have also broken out on Tenerife, another of the Canary Islands, forcing around 50 people to evacuate and burning through around 60 hectares (123 acres).
In Greece, more than 500 firefighters are trying to control the four wildfires.
In the area of Loutraki – a popular seaside town in the Peloponnese, southwest of Athens – 1,200 children were evacuated from a summer camp amid a wildfire there, local mayor Giorgos Gkionis told Greek media.  A nursing home was also evacuated.
Meanwhile, two large wildfires are raging southeast and northwest of Athens. The largest of the two started after midday local time in the area of Kouvaras – southeast of Athens – and expanded 7 miles in the first two hours. Residents of Kouvaras as well as the nearby seaside resorts of Saronida, Anavyssos and Lagonisi have been ordered to protectively evacuate.
A fire also closed the airport Monday in the city of Catania on the Italian island of Sicily, with flights suspended until 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to a Twitter post from the airport authorities.
Firefighters have controlled the fire and it’s not yet clear if the region’s high temperatures played any role. Catania was one of several cities under a hot weather red alert on Sunday, according to a Reuters report.

The world’s largest and most populous continent is reckoning with the deadly effects of extreme summer weather, as countries endure blistering heatwaves and record monsoon rainfall, with governments warning residents to prepare for more to come.
This month torrential rains inundated parts of Japan, China, South Korea and India, upending the lives of millions and causing flash floods, landslides and power cuts. Record temperatures also led to a rise in heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable communities such as the elderly.
On Saturday, at least 13 people in the central South Korean city of Cheongju died after waters from a burst riverbank flooded an underpass, trapping vehicles, including a public bus.
At least 41 people have died in South Korea in recent days and thousands more have been forced to evacuate their homes and seek temporary shelter, as heavy downpours hit central and southern parts of the country.
In response to the loss of life, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for an overhaul of the country’s approach to extreme weather.
“This kind of extreme weather event will become commonplace — we must accept climate change is happening, and deal with it,” Yoon said Monday.
In neighboring Japan, record rainfall in the southwest of the country resulted in devastating flooding that left at least six people dead, and many others still missing.
“It’s raining like never before,” a spokesman for Japan’s Meteorological Agency said in a statement that called for maximum vigilance from residents in affected areas.
It is a pattern seen throughout the region — from parts of the Philippines and Cambodia in the south where widespread flooding has led to transport disruptions in major cities including the capitals Manila and Phnom Penh — to parts of India further north where record rainfall brought several states to a near standstill and claimed the lives of dozens, according to officials.
The capital Delhi on July 10 marked its wettest July day in more than 40 years, according to authorities. The heavy downpours forced school closures and left many vulnerable without shelter.
One extreme to another
While some regions are grappling with deadly downpours, others are facing searing heat.
On Monday, a weather station in northeastern China recorded a record high temperature of 52.2 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit), while Japan saw temperatures rise to 39.7 degrees Celsius (103 Fahrenheit).
In total, more than five weather stations in China exceeded highs of 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) Monday — among the hottest in history. This follows a record hot summer in the capital Beijing which saw temperatures in early July soar past 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) — prompting officials to issue heat red alerts for two weeks as the global climate crisis intensifies.
The heatwave hits amid the arrival of US Climate Envoy John Kerry in China on Sunday for talks between Beijing and Washington to resume cooperation on climate discussions.
China, one of the world’s biggest polluters, has been seeing its share of extreme weather events — with torrential downpours and flooding battering other parts of the country particularly in the south.
Heatwaves have also struck parts of Japan. Temperatures as of Monday morning rose to highs of 39.7 degrees Celsius (103 Fahrenheit) in the city of Kiryu, located in Gunma Prefecture on Honshu island — Japan’s largest and most populous which also houses Kyoto and Tokyo, and 39.6 degrees Celsius in Hatoyama a town located in Saitama Prefecture.
Cases of heat stroke have become increasingly common among Japan’s elderly, who account for 28% of the population.
Temperatures in the capital Tokyo have soared to dangerous levels in recent years, leaving government officials to call for electricity rationing as the country struggles with growing power shortages.
A vulnerable region
Scientists have warned the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events will continue to increase as the human-caused climate crisis accelerates.
In its annual climate update, the World Meteorological Organization said the world is on track to breach a critical climate threshold in the next five years as global temperatures continue to climb above pre-industrial levels.
Asia, with an estimated total population of 4.4 billion people, is acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with recent bouts of extreme weather resulting in water shortages, crop failures and a slow down in the economy.
That vulnerability was thrown into sharp focus last year when catastrophic flooding hit Pakistan killing more than 1,700 people and leaving millions homeless.
The South Asian country is now dealing with its worst economic crisis in decades, worsened by inflation spiking because of the floods ruining last year’s harvests.
“One thing is very clear: what happened in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, warning that climate change would not spare countries.
“The entire definition of national security has changed today. And unless the leaders of the world come together to act and act now on an agreed common agenda, there will be no earth to fight wars over. Nature will be fighting back. And for that, humanity is no match at all.”
Neighboring India, the world’s most populous nation, is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide.
After suffering recent blistering heat waves in the north and east, thousands were then forced to flee severe flooding in states like Himachal Pradesh last week after heavy rains battered villages and turned roads into rivers.
Every year, India is hit by severe flooding and landslides during the monsoon season, which drenches the country from June to September.
Assam, a state with a population of more than 31 million people, is among the worst hit.
More than 495,000 people spread across 22 districts were impacted by floodwaters and about 14,000 evacuated to relief camps when rain swept across the region. Disaster management officials and state authorities in late June reported at least 10 deaths since the rains began.
Video broadcast on local television showed villagers wading neck-deep through the muddy water with their cattle, and homes, shops and cars submerged in the floods.
Red alerts, indicating the highest threat level, were issued for several northern states including Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Haryana. Landslide warnings were also issued for Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.
The heavy downpours also forced school closures in a number of areas including Uttar Pradesh and the capital New Delhi.
The impact of such weather extremes is hard to miss and India’s poor are among the most vulnerable.
Floods have posed a particular danger to the 35% of the population — roughly 472 million people — who live in urban slums, according to the World Bank.
“The irony of it is that the poor of the world are actually victims of climate change,” even if they aren’t the ones who “created the problem,” Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment and veteran Indian environmentalist told CNN last year.
“Floods, droughts and other devastating climate events are “all showing us very clearly what will the future be,” she added."

Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
A phenomenon that scientists have called “underground climate change” is deforming the ground beneath cities, a study conducted in Chicago has found.
This shifting of land under urban areas could pose a problem for buildings and infrastructure, threatening long-term performance and durability, according to the research.
Technically known as “subsurface heat islands,” underground climate change is the warming of the ground under our feet, caused by heat released by buildings and subterranean transportation such as subway systems.
“The denser the city, the more intense is underground climate change,” said lead study author Alessandro Rotta Loria, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Soil, rocks and construction materials deform when subjected to temperature variations. For example, the ground underneath buildings can contract when heated, causing unwanted settlement, Rotta Loria said.
New York City is sinking due to its million-plus buildings, study says
“Deformations caused by underground climate change are relatively small in magnitude, but they continuously develop,” he said. “Over time, they can become very significant for the operational performance of civil infrastructure like building foundations, water retaining walls, tunnels and so on.”
But underground climate change is not the same as what we think of as climate change in the atmosphere, which is largely driven by greenhouse gases and has far-reaching effects, said David Archer, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.
“Calling it climate change seems like a bit of a coattail thing,” Archer, who was not involved with the study, said.
The term “underground climate change,” however, was not coined for this study — it has been in use, and the phenomenon a subject of research, for some time.
Studied for the past 25 years, underground climate change can cause issues such as groundwater contamination or problems with underground railways by making tracks prone to buckling or causing passengers to become ill due to excessive heat. Its effects on civil infrastructure, however, had not been explored until this study, according to Rotta Loria.
The research, published this month in the journal Communications Engineering, was conducted by installing 150 temperature sensors across the Chicago Loop district, both above and below ground, and in a variety of places such as basements, tunnels and parking garages. Sensors were also placed in Grant Park along Lake Michigan to compare temperatures from an unbuilt area with no excess heat coming from construction or transportation.
Data was collected over three years, and the results showed that the ground under the Loop was up to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) warmer than the ground beneath the park.
“We found underground structures, such as basements, where the air temperature was very high,” Rotta Loria said. “And the consequence of that is that at least a portion of the heat will diffuse towards the ground over time, and that’s the origin of the phenomenon.”
Researchers then used the data to build a computer model of the Chicago Loop and simulate the effect of the rising temperatures on the ground, from the 1950s until the 2050. They found that depending on the composition of the soil, the ground reacts unevenly to warming and can both expand and contract by amounts that — while imperceptible to humans — could cause problems for buildings.
“It’s important to stress that underground climate change does not threaten the safety of people and does not threaten to collapse structures and buildings,” Rotta Loria said. “It does pose a potential challenge for the functionality and the durability of structures, because excessive ground deformations can lead to distortion, tilting and potentially cracking.”
As a result, water could flow more easily into cracked structures, potentially causing corrosion in materials such as reinforced concrete.
“There is what I call a silent hazard,” Rotta Loria said. “Buildings that are more prone to issues, because they were designed and built with outdated approaches, are also those that contribute the most to underground climate change, because they lack appropriate thermal insulation and therefore inject the most heat into the ground.”
It’s not all doom and gloom, however, according to Rotta Loria. “This study can make us realize that we are in front of an opportunity — we can take action, and in different ways,” he said.
Future buildings will not significantly increase the phenomenon, because modern construction technologies and regulations mandate better insulation and energy efficiency. And for those structures that already exist, understanding underground heat presents opportunities, according to Rotta Loria.
Humans pump so much groundwater that Earth’s axis has shifted, study finds
“We can take action by applying thermal insulation to underground building enclosures, to minimize the amount of waste heat that goes into the ground,” he said. “But if for any reason we aren’t able to thermally insulate the buildings to enhance their energy efficiency, we could at least deploy geothermal technologies underneath or next to them to absorb the waste heat that is generated and use it for heating and cooling.”
David Toll, a professor of engineering and codirector of the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University in the United Kingdom, said the study is important as the effects of thermal movements of the ground beneath cities have not been a focus of much research.
“My conclusion from the study would be that, for the Chicago Loop, we now know that these thermal movements that have taken place, and those predicted for the immediate future,  are not large enough to be of concern. That is a very useful finding,” said Toll, who did not participate in the research.
“However, that is not to say that such temperature changes below other cities, with different ground conditions, could not be potentially problematic.”"
What record warm ocean temperatures could mean for hurricane season,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/weather/hurricane-season-ocean-temperature-florida-climate/index.html,"What record warm ocean temperatures could mean for hurricane season
Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.
The Atlantic hurricane season is headed into uncharted territory with water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico warmer than they have ever been on record.
Seasonal forecasters are warning it means you need to prepare for a more uncertain forecast for the rest of the season with the potential for more storms and stronger ones.
Warm ocean water is one of the key ingredients for fueling hurricanes and it’s been in abundance so far this year. Scientists first sounded the alarm in April and the ocean warmth has only escalated since. Water in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic has been record warm, especially for this early in the year. It includes off the coast of Florida, where water temperatures in the Florida Keys were close to 97 degrees in some spots last week.
It is important because warm ocean water breeds stronger, bigger and wetter storms. It gives hurricanes the energy they need to grow and sometimes rapidly intensify, something hurricane forecasters told CNN we could see more of this season. Warm oceans can also lead to more evaporation and wring out more rainfall falling from any storms.
But hurricane season predictions involve more than just warm water. It’s just one factor in the birth and survival of tropical cyclones, and it is creating more uncertainty than usual in what could happen the rest of the hurricane season.
“Uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty! That’s really the story going forward with this season,” Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University told me.
Klotzbach and the team at CSU are some of the pioneers of long-term hurricane season outlooks, and just increased the number of expected hurricanes and major hurricanes in their prediction for this season due to the warmer water in the Atlantic.
What makes this year even more uncertain is we are now under the influence of El Niño which typically suppresses activity in the Atlantic with increased wind shear, the changing of wind direction and speed with height which can blow budding storms to pieces and shred existing storms to death.
Klotzbach said the confluence of these record warm temperatures at the same time as a moderate to strong El Niño hasn’t been “observed historically.”
The million-dollar question right now is which will win out: warm ocean temperatures or El Niño. Early season predictions called for a near-average season, but Klotzbach and team seem to think the warm water will win out and are now calling for “an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.”
Warm water won in June. According to Klotzbach, June had the lowest wind shear in the southern Atlantic Basin since 1988. Arlene, Bret and Cindy formed as a result.
Wind shear and dry air from Saharan dust picked up in the month of July, suppressing hurricane activity for the most part, but August through October could be different.
“Most climate models are forecasting slightly to somewhat-below normal shear in August, September and even into October,” Klotzbach said. “If that were the case, we would likely have an extremely busy season given how warm the Atlantic is.”
As of now, there’s not much noteworthy on the horizon as far as tropical development goes.  Subtropical Storm Don is meandering around the north-central Atlantic but poses no threat to land. Forecast models aren’t picking up any development this week. Forecasts for next week are hinting at some tropical development, but it’s far too early to have confidence in how, if or when this could materialize.
What we do know is hurricane season typically starts ramping up as we head into August. The first hurricane usually forms in early to mid-August. The eight-week span from mid-August through mid-October is when ocean temperatures are nearing their highest levels in the Atlantic, wind shear lessens considerably and when nearly 90% of all hurricane activity in the Atlantic happens.
The bottom line is this season is already unprecedented given the hot ocean temperatures, so forecasting the season in the uncharted territory we’ve entered is a challenge. We’ve got a lot of hurricane season left to go, which means you should prepare for the worst and hope for the best."
The icy patience of an Arctic photographer,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/arctic-photography-florian-ledoux-climate-c2e-spc-intl-scn/index.html,"The icy patience of an Arctic photographer
Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
The polar bear was just a faraway speck in a frozen white expanse. A film crew began to follow at a distance, gradually getting closer. Suddenly the bear picked up a scent and changed direction – the crew followed, hoping it would lead to footage of a kill. The bear came to a rest at a seal hole in the ice and started to wait. So did the crew.
For 12 hours they sat, waiting for the bear to make a move. For 12 hours the bear lay half asleep, half awake at the edge of the hole. It was too long; the crew had been awake working for 22 hours straight on the sea ice and needed to get back to camp. Cold and exhausted, they admitted defeat. Hours of waiting for little reward is not uncommon. “It’s the price we pay to get unique images,” recounts award-winning French photographer and filmmaker Florian Ledoux.
This is the reality of wildlife photography – it is always on nature’s terms. But that’s the challenge and attraction of it, too. “Every shot we get in the Arctic is a battle,” he says. “We push our limits; we feel alive by doing it.”
Ledoux is speaking to CNN over a video call from his home in Tromsø, northern Norway. He’s wearing a red and white knitted turtleneck and, at just 2pm local time, the sky through the window behind him is a rich indigo in December’s polar night.
He has spent the last two winters on the Arctic sea ice, filming iconic scenes for the BBC’s nature documentary series “Frozen Planet” and the Disney film “Polar Bear” among others. Driven by a passion to preserve nature, his extraordinary aerial photography has earned him awards such as the 2018 Siena International Photo Awards drone photographer of the year and Nature TTL’s photographer of the year in 2020. Now he’s planning for his 2023 winter expedition, which will see him setting off from Longyearbyen, the world’s northernmost settlement, to spend days and nights on the sea ice.
“If we start at the end of February, we have a bit of light. The sun passes above the horizon around 11am or 12pm and then it’s dark at 2pm or 3pm,” he explains. From then on, the hours of light rapidly increase. “At the beginning of April, you can’t see the stars anymore, and by mid-April you have the midnight sun,” he adds.
The months when the sun just starts to poke through create the perfect palette for a photographer, Ledoux says. Every pastel shade of blue shines through and as the sun disappears, a pink belt shimmers on the horizon.
But capturing this Arctic twilight comes at a cost. Ledoux describes how the obliterating winter conditions take their physical toll – overwhelming darkness and low vitamin D levels affect your mood, the lack of routine messes up your body clock, and you are forever fighting the bitter cold, with temperatures on some days plummeting to minus 40 degrees Celsius. On those days, everything you touch with bare hands sticks to your skin and every time you exhale the moisture freezes on your face, he says. Despite wearing several layers of clothes, huge down mittens and a neoprene face mask and ski goggles, the cold bites through.
Yet these are the days Ledoux lives for. There was a time last winter, when the air was crisp, the sun was low, and an intense silence enveloped the sea ice. He spotted steam rising from behind an iceberg and, following it with his drone, discovered a large male polar bear asleep on the ice: “His body was warm and as he was breathing, smoke came out of his mouth like a dragon.”
Starring roles
Despite being out in the wilderness beyond most human contact, Ledoux is often at the mercy of a producer’s shot list. Disney, Netflix or the likes will request a specific shot of a polar bear, such as a successful hunt or a mating scene. Ticking these off can take days or months, but the key is not to rush it.
After finding a bear, the crew will position itself ahead of the bear and wait for it to gradually come closer. “We want to make sure the bear likes us,” says Ledoux, adding that to capture candid and unique behavior the bear needs to feel comfortable in their presence. If a bear is skittish or reacts badly to them being there, they will stop pursuing it. “That’s just the way it is – if it doesn’t want to be the star, you can’t force it.”
Over time, Ledoux believes you begin to recognize individual bears. Some look different, with the shape of their face or physical markings giving them away. Others have distinct characters; some are shy and some are curious and playful.
One of his blockbuster shots, which took pride of place in Disney’s “Polar Bear”, shows two bears joyfully ice skating together. Ledoux had never witnessed two bears having such fun: “It was pure magic. We were so high after that we forgot to eat all day or night.”
The feeling of being close to a polar bear is addictive, he says. The first time he saw one he had goosebumps, and despite hundreds of encounters since, that reaction hasn’t died down. “They are so majestic and beautiful … It brings (up) a lot of emotions,” he adds. His goal is to convey these emotions through his images.
Melting ice
One of Ledoux’s photos, which landed the cover of Oceanographic Magazine and Wildlife Photographic, shows a polar bear leaping precariously between broken bits of ice. It sends a message of fragility and reflects the threat of shrinking ice sheets. The Arctic is heating up nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, causing ice to melt and threatening the whole ecosystem that depends on it.
Even in the few years Ledoux has explored the Arctic, he has witnessed these changes. It has rained for days in the winter months and the terrain they can work on is diminishing as sea ice becomes less stable.
“It’s important to document,” he says, comparing his role to that of a war photographer, albeit at a slower pace and less imminently dangerous. There is an urgency, and he feels a duty to record what is happening.
“Would I fly the drone just for flying the drone? No,” he says. “The drone is a tool that allows me to capture some unique beauty and perspective of nature, to give a voice to the one that cannot speak.”
This story has been updated to clarify Florian Ledoux’s filming process."
A weekslong heat wave will intensify this weekend and push temperatures close to 130 degrees,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/weather/heat-wave-phoenix-california-las-vegas-climate/index.html,"A weekslong heat wave will intensify this weekend and push temperatures close to 130 degrees
An already dangerous weekslong heat wave will only worsen this weekend as a heat dome intensifies and reaches peak strength over parts of the Western United States.
The heat dome is so formidable the National Weather Service in Phoenix called it “one of the strongest high pressure systems this region has ever seen.” Around 100 heat records could fall today through the weekend as it intensifies, piling onto the more than 1,000 high temperature records broken in the US since June.
More than 90 million people are under heat alerts after the heat dome expanded into places like California, which is now experiencing its first extreme heat wave of the year.
It has already been dangerously hot for weeks in Texas, Florida and Arizona, where Phoenix is in the middle of a likely record-breaking streak of consecutive 110-degree days, forcing many businesses and parks to close or readjust their hours. The low temperature in Phoenix might not drop below 90 degrees for eight consecutive days, another record.
The heat will be so intense, forecasters suggested residents of Las Vegas avoid the outdoors between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., with the city forecast to challenge its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees on Sunday. It won’t get much cooler at night, with low temperatures nearing 90 degrees – a particularly dangerous side effect of the climate crisis.
Even the hottest place on Earth, California’s Death Valley, could reach rare highs, with 130 degrees possible Sunday, forecasters at the National Weather Service told CNN. It has only happened a handful of times, one of which is the all-time global record high temperature of 134 degrees.
In turn, Death Valley National Park in California and Saguaro National Park in Arizona posted warnings on their websites advising people not hike after 10 a.m. local time.
Officials at New Mexico’s White Sands National Park cautioned,”High temperatures over 100F degrees are expected. We strongly recommend to not start a hike if the temperature is over 85F degrees.”
Also, Texas authorities at Big Bend National Park said temperatures top 110 degrees daily along the Rio Grande river and throughout the desert areas.
“These are extremely dangerous/deadly temperatures! Hikers should be OFF TRAILS in the afternoon. Stay hydrated. Limit your exposure,” the park said on its website.
This kind of extreme heat is one of the hallmarks of human-caused climate change, the symptoms of which are tallying up this year into a global record box score of sorts: “unprecedented” ocean heat off the coast of Florida and in the North Atlantic; record heat in Beijing, in what could be one of the hottest summers in China; record energy demand and heat in Texas; and an ongoing “Cerberus” heat wave, threatening to topple European temperature records.
It all adds up to what could be the hottest year on record.
Businesses, parks close as temperatures climb
Skyrocketing temperatures across the western US have forced some businesses and parks to close or change their hours, such as the Sacramento Zoo, which shortened its hours due to the heat, closing early Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m. PT as temperatures are forecast to reach 109 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend.
In Bakersfield, California, where the highest temperature this weekend is set to reach 114 degrees Fahrenheit, the Kern County Museum announced it would be closed “due to extreme heat” this weekend, according to a museum social media post. In Southern California, the Cleveland National Forest announced on its Facebook page that four of its trails – the San Diego River Gorge, Cedar Creek Falls, Three Sisters Falls and Eagle Peak – will be closed through the weekend due to “excessive heat.”
Other businesses in California, such as the California Gray’s Flower Garden in Quincy and the Nascere Vineyards in Chico announced plans to close their doors over the weekend as temperatures are expected to reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
The Bison Café in Quitaque, Texas said it was limiting its hours due to higher temperatures that are making the kitchen “very uncomfortable” for cooks.
Separately, in Phoenix, the Arizona Animal Welfare League decided to close its doors for the weekend. “The safety of our pets is our top priority and with temperatures expected to hit over 115, our staff’s main focus will be on keeping our animals cool and comfortable during this time,” a Facebook post from the organization reads.
A ‘perfect storm’ of deadly heat
The records also add up into something more serious for human health, doctors say.
“Make no mistake about it: This heat is deadly, and being in it for long periods of time is deadly,” Dr. Matthew Levy of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine told CNN.
The extreme temperatures could trigger heat illness in as little as 20 to 30 minutes for people doing anything strenuous outdoors, because heat acts as a “perfect storm,” which overloads the body until it eventually short-circuits and then shuts down, Levy said. The time frame would be even shorter for those most vulnerable to heat, like the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions.
Heat illness is a serious concern this weekend for the millions of residents in major metro areas like Phoenix and Las Vegas.
People across the Southwest and California’s Central Valley are under a rare “extreme” level of heat risk on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to the weather service.
The “extreme HeatRisk” is the highest possible risk level for heat, akin to a “high risk” for tornadoes, and is meant to warn of significant heat impacts requiring preparation.
These areas should prepare for spikes in heat-related ER visits, potential power outages from demand and temperatures high enough to turn deadly, especially for outdoor workers and those without reliable cooling.
Levy said workers can stay safe by taking frequent hydration breaks, wearing clothing able to reflect the sun and having a “buddy system” so no one is left in the heat alone when illness strikes. For those who don’t have reliable cooling, he recommends finding a cooling center and having a plan to get there before the need arises.
Before the latest wave, heat has already killed at least 12 people in Phoenix’s Maricopa County this year, and killed 425 people last year. The city has opened “respite centers” to help provide relief and the state has asked residents to keep their vehicles stocked with water.
The heat won’t go away after this weekend, even if temperatures peak: Longer term temperature outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center point to above normal temperatures across Southern California, the Southwest, South and Florida through next week.

What is El Niño?,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/weather/what-is-el-nino-xpn/index.html,"What is El Niño?
El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world.
Warm water normally is confined to the western Pacific by winds that blow from east to west, pushing it toward Indonesia and Australia. But during an El Niño, the winds slow down and can even reverse direction, allowing the warmer water to spread eastward all the way to South America.
Scientists are still searching for an answer as to why this happens, but the slowing of these winds can last for weeks or months.
El Niños – among many large-scale weather patterns that act in tandem to influence global weather – occur every two to seven years in varying intensity, and the waters of the eastern Pacific can be up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) warmer than usual.
El Niño, which in Spanish means “little boy,” is the opposite of the La Niña, or “little girl,” climate pattern.
El Niño offers a global study in opposites
A strong El Niño heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe.
It can especially affect the jet stream – a narrow band of strong wind in the upper atmosphere – over the Pacific, which gets stronger and dumps more frequent and intense storms over the western US, especially California, and along South America’s west coast.
The atmosphere, however, is something of a zero-sum game: More rain in North and South America falls at the expense of normally rainy southern Asia and Australia, which in turn can experience droughts.
El Niño has been known to cause intense flooding across eastern sections of Africa – leading to landslides, an increase in waterborne diseases and even food shortages – while northern and southern parts of the continent experience severe drought.
A strong El Niño also influences cyclone seasons around the planet. The warmer the Pacific is, the more hurricanes or typhoons it gets – while fewer hurricanes form in Atlantic Ocean because increased upper-level winds prevent them from developing. This happened during the 2015 hurricane season, with the Pacific breaking records while the Atlantic seeing a relatively quiet year.
It can affect US rainfall – and Pacific fish
Like snowflakes, no two El Niños are exactly alike. For instance, an area of warmer water in the northern Pacific that became known as “the blob” during the 2014-2016 El Niño event wasn’t there during the 1997 El Niño.
But during typical El Niño years, more rain falls in the southwestern and southeastern United States, while the North experiences much drier and warmer weather.
And weather isn’t the only thing El Niño affects. Warmer surface waters in the eastern Pacific drive away cold-water fish that are the backbone of the fishing industry in much of Latin America. In fact, fishermen there first noticed the phenomenon and named it “little boy” or “Christ child” in Spanish, since it often appeared around Christmas.
Its climate crisis impact is under review
The influence of the climate crisis on El Niño is still a matter of debate.
Climate change could make El Niños’ impact worse, some recent studies show. And while the overall number of El Niños is unlikely to increase as the planet warms, amplified, so-called “super” El Niños will be twice as likely, other research suggests.
Among the most likely byproducts of global warming are more extreme precipitation events because warmer temperatures can hold more water vapor in the atmosphere. That could make El Niño-induced floods even more devastating."
How to make your next vacation better for the environment,https://www.cnn.com/travel/environmentally-friendly-travel-tips/index.html,"How to make your next vacation better for the environment
Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.
Being an environmentally friendly tourist can be challenging. Tourism is an industry that brings many negative environmental impacts – our pleasure often comes at the expense of local habitats or wildlife.
Maya Bay on Thailand’s uninhabited Ko Phi Phi Leh island became famous as the location of the 2000 Hollywood movie “The Beach.” But this led to rapid growth in visitors to the bay – as many as 8,000 a day at its peak – and put enormous strain on the bay’s natural habitats.
In 2018, the bay was closed to tourists for four years to let its coral reefs and wildlife recover.
But tourism can also be an inspiring way to connect with oneself, with others and with new places. As tourists, we can learn, share and contribute to positive environmental practices.
As a tourist, you also have influence. The money you spend, the social interactions you have and the resources you consume all help to shape an area.
So here are four pieces of advice for making your next vacation better for the environment.
Spend locally
We’ve all heard variations on the mantra “take only memories, leave only footprints”. This message of less consumption and lower impact is a good ethos for environmentally sensitive tourism. The first thing to do is think about how you can leave more positive footprints behind.
An excellent way to make the most of your economic footprint is to stay and shop in independent businesses. These businesses tend to pay local taxes and are owned by and employ local people. More of the money you spend stays in the immediate area as a result.
Where tourist money directly benefits local people and businesses, their support for conservation is often encouraged. Tourists visiting rhino sanctuaries in Botswana, for example, bring income and support jobs. In 2010, the country’s Khama Rhino Sanctuary employed 26 permanent staff and many more casual laborers.
This economic security can, in turn, prompt local people to appreciate the importance of protecting vulnerable animal species like rhinos. Separate research on people living around Kenya’s Maasai Mara nature reserve found that people whose livelihoods were dependent on tourism were more likely to support efforts to conserve local wildlife.
Tread lightly
Tourism creates waste and uses up resources. Treading carefully will minimise the environmental impact you have on your vacation destination.
A simple way to lower your environmental footprint is to use fewer resources at every stage of your vacation. A single tourist uses 300 liters of water in their holiday accommodation on average each night. Reusing towels, flushing the toilet less and shortening your shower time can all help to reduce demand for water resources.
Thinking about the footprints you leave as a tourist is a useful mindset. You may even become more aware of the positive legacy you can leave behind.
Learn about the local area and the environmental issues that matter there. If habitat loss is a problem, contribute to local organisations that support conservation. Organisations like the National Trust even offer vacations in the UK that help to fund their work.
Two flight attendants fell in love on an airplane. Here’s what happened next
Place matters
Tourism shifts you away from the familiar and gives you space for self-reflection. Research has found that people have been inspired by travel to make life changes such as relocating or shifting career.
Many keen rock climbers, for instance, adopt a minimalist and mobile lifestyle. One study on climbers’ lifestyles in the US showed that the challenges of life on the road, gatherings at campgrounds and the considerable amount of time spent in nature can be enriching.
Rock climbers’ lifestyles are inspired by and connected to natural settings. And many alternative types of tourism are too. These tourists can become powerful advocates for the protection of the places they care deeply about. Surf tourists, for example, have driven various campaigns against the discharge of sewage into UK bathing waters.
You and those you travel with can be similar cheerleaders for the places you care about. Join organizations fighting for their conservation, contribute to their sustainable development and share your appreciation of these places with others.
Stay curious
A final thing you can do as a tourist is to keep exploring. It can be tempting to stay in a tourist bubble and not leave the confines of your resort or stick with familiar travel groups and activities.
Cruises are a classic example of bubble tourism. The places visited do not really matter; the floating hotel is the main attraction.
But cruise tourism rarely benefits local populations and brings significant negative environmental impacts. In the Trujillo Bay area of Honduras, for example, increases in garbage and sewage have been reported since commercial cruise tourism began operating in the area in 2014.
Similar concerns have prompted calls to restrict cruise tourism in popular European destinations like Venice, Marseille and Barcelona. In 2022, more than 50,000 people signed a petition to ban cruise ships from Marseille.
Going beyond familiar or fashionable tourist bubbles can help you avoid such negative associations. Short-haul city breaks are a more environmentally friendly option.
Travelers to these destinations are more likely to use means of transportation that are associated with less CO₂ emissions than long-haul travel, such as trains or coaches. And in urban areas, their activities are likely to take place in a concentrated geographical area.
Thinking about the footprints you leave and the memories you take can help you to become a more environmentally aware tourist. Leave positive imprints behind, tread carefully, put yourself out there and keep exploring.
This is a mantra to adopt and share with your travel groups to get the most out of your holiday experiences while simultaneously reducing your impact on the planet.

"Climate change is making our oceans change color, new research finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/12/world/climate-change-ocean-colors-scli-intl-scn/index.html,"Climate change is making our oceans change color, new research finds
The color of the ocean has changed significantly over the last 20 years and human-caused climate change is likely responsible, according to a new study.
More than 56% of the world’s oceans have changed color to an extent that cannot be explained by natural variability, said a team of researchers, led by scientists from the National Oceanography Center in the UK and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, in a statement.
Tropical oceans close to the equator in particular have become greener in the past two decades, reflecting changes in their ecosystems, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
The color of the ocean is derived from the materials found in its upper layers. For example, a deep blue sea will have very little life in it, whereas a green color means there are ecosystems there, based on phytoplankton, plant-like microbes which contain chlorophyll. The phytoplankton form the basis of a food web which supports larger organisms such as krill, fish, seabirds and marine mammals.
It’s not clear exactly how these ecosystems are changing, said study co-author Stephanie Dutkiewicz, senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and the Center for Global Change Science. While some areas are likely to have less phytoplankton, others will have more – and it’s likely all parts of the ocean will see changes in the types of phytoplankton present.
Ocean ecosystems are finely balanced and any change in the phytoplankton will send ripples across the food chain. “All changes are causing an imbalance in the natural organization of ecosystems. Such imbalance will only get worse over time if our oceans keep heating,” she told CNN.
It will also affect the ocean’s ability to act as a store of carbon, Dutkiewicz said, as different plankton absorb different amounts of carbon.
While the researchers are still working to unpick exactly what the changes mean, what is clear, they said, is that the changes are being driven by human-induced climate change.
‘Clear trend’
The researchers monitored changes in ocean color from space by tracking how much green or blue light is reflected from the surface of the sea.
They used data from the Aqua satellite which has been monitoring ocean color changes for more than two decades and is able to pick out differences that are not visible to the human eye.
They analyzed color variation data from 2002 to 2022 and then used climate change models to simulate what would happen to the oceans both with additional planet-heating pollution and without.
The color changes matched almost exactly what Dutkiewicz predicted would happen if greenhouse gases were added to the atmosphere – that around 50% of our oceans would change color.
Dutkiewicz, who has been running simulations that showed the oceans were going to change color for years, said she is not surprised at this finding.
“But still I found the results very sobering; yet another wake-up call that human induced climate change [has] significantly impacted the earth system,” she told CNN via email.
Dutkiewicz told CNN it was difficult to say whether color changes could become visible to humans if the process continues.
“If a big tipping point was reached in some places: maybe. Though you’d have to study the colors for a while to be able to pick up on the changes,” said Dutkiewicz.
Next up, Dutkiewicz will try to better understand the color changes in different ocean regions, as well as looking into what might be causing them, she said."
US climate envoy John Kerry set to travel to Beijing this weekend,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/politics/john-kerry-climate-envoy-china/index.html,"US climate envoy John Kerry set to travel to Beijing this weekend
US climate envoy John Kerry is set to travel to Beijing this weekend for climate talks with his Chinese counterparts, a Biden administration official told CNN.
The meeting comes as the US and China seek ways to work together on the climate crisis – a topic of top concern for both nations. It will mark the third visit by a US Cabinet official to the Chinese capital in a matter of weeks as Washington seeks to steer relations with Beijing back on course after months of inflamed tensions.
A meeting between Kerry and his counterpart in China, Xie Zhenhua, has been months in the making, Biden’s climate czar told CNN in May. Kerry and Xie’s work together has been a relative bright spot amid an otherwise bumpy US and China relationship.
“At some point, we’re going to travel over there and pick up where we left off,” Kerry said at the time.
The three issues top of mind for Kerry when he spoke to CNN in May for a potential meeting in China included the country implementing its plan to cut emissions of super-polluting methane, demonstrating it can move away from coal faster and working with the US on the issue of deforestation.
Last week saw the hottest global temperature ever recorded, according to data from two climate tracking agencies that covers multiple decades. And as the climate crisis intensifies, scientists are clear that record-breaking heat waves are set to become more frequent and more severe.
Kerry’s planned trip comes after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrapped up meetings with China’s new economic leadership, including Premier Li Qiang and Pan Gongsheng, the newly appointed Communist Party chief of China’s central bank.
Yellen in her talks with the officials urged the country to support international funds intended to help developing countries confront the climate crisis, as Beijing grappled with one of the most severe heat waves on its record.
“Climate change is at the top of the list of global challenges, and the United States and China must work together to address this existential threat,” Yellen said.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also traveled to Beijing in June to meet with senior Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping
Yellen walked away with the message that “the world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive,” while Blinken felt the countries had “made progress and we are moving forward.”
Still, even as the US looks to resume diplomatic relations with the country, it has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies, successfully pushed allies in Japan and the Netherlands to restrict sales of advanced semiconductors to China and rallied other advanced economies to counter Beijing’s “economic coercion.”

"A ‘perfect storm’ is unfolding this summer and it’s ‘supercharging’ the weather, scientist says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/weather/flooding-heat-perfect-storm-climate-ingredients/index.html,"A ‘perfect storm’ is unfolding this summer and it’s ‘supercharging’ the weather, scientist says
A “perfect storm” is unfolding this summer, one climate scientist told CNN, as atmospheric ingredients combine to create deadly flooding in the Northeast US and record-breaking heat in the Southwest US and around the world.
Deadly flooding inundated parts of the Northeast, trapping people in their homes and killing at least one woman who was swept away by the fast-moving water. Rivers in Vermont rose quickly in the torrential rain on Monday to levels not seen since Hurricane Irene in 2011.
On Sunday, more than 7.5 inches of rain fell at West Point, New York, in just six hours — a 1,000-year rainfall event for the area, according to a CNN analysis of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense, it only happens on average once every 1,000 years.
The climate crisis is stacking the deck in favor of more intense weather events like the heavy rain and flooding in the Northeast, said Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist and distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
“Sure, weather is weather. It’s going to happen — rainfall, flooding events are going to happen,” Mann told CNN. “What climate change is doing is it’s supercharging them, so when you get one of those weather systems that’s producing large amounts of rainfall, you get more rainfall.”
There’s another, more surprising way that the climate crisis could be driving these extreme rainfall events, Mann said, and it’s something on the forefront of climate research: The jet stream could be getting “stuck” in positions that prolong these kinds of extreme events.
The jet stream is the fast-moving river of air high in the atmosphere that ushers weather systems across the globe. Importantly, it’s fueled by the extreme difference in temperature between the equator and the poles.
But the planet is not warming equally in all locations, Mann explained. The Arctic is warming much faster than the Lower 48, for example, which “reduces the temperature difference from the equator to the pole.”
Scientists suspect that this decrease in temperature difference is changing how the jet stream behaves.
“The jet stream basically stalls and those weather patterns remain in place — those high and low pressure centers remain in place,” Mann said. “And we’re seeing more of these sort of stuck, wavy jet stream patterns that are associated with these very persistent weather extremes, whether it’s the heat, drought, wildfire or the flooding events.”
As the Northeast is inundated with flooding rain, dangerous heat is threatening other parts of the world. Temperatures are soaring in the Southwest this week, where Phoenix could break its record for consecutive number of days above 110 degrees.
Last week, the planet’s average daily temperature climbed to record levels in data tracked by two climate agencies in the US and Europe. Climate scientists told CNN that the global temperatures were likely the highest in at least 100,000 years.
Meanwhile, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found that last month was the hottest June by a “substantial margin” above the previous record, which was set in 2019.
Given the exceptional heat, scientists are concerned that 2023 could be the hottest year on record.
Mann said that El Niño is “adding extra heat, extra fuel to the fire.” El Niño, which is a warm phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, is combining with the climate crisis “and what you get is new record levels of heat at the planetary scale.”
But Mann said without the climate crisis, which is caused by burning fossil fuels, “we simply wouldn’t be seeing these extreme events.”
“Those are conspiring. They’re combining,” Mann said. “The steady warming combined with an El Niño; extreme weather events related to those changing jet stream conditions – it all comes together, if you will, in a perfect storm of consequences, which translates to truly devastating and deadly weather extremes that we’re dealing with here right now.”

Global heat in ‘uncharted territory’ as scientists warn 2023 could be the hottest year on record,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/08/world/extreme-global-temperature-heat-records-climate/index.html,"Global heat in ‘uncharted territory’ as scientists warn 2023 could be the hottest year on record
The world is blasting through climate records as scientists sound the alarm: The likelihood is growing that 2023 could be the hottest year on record, and the climate crisis could be altering our weather in ways they don’t yet understand.
And they are not holding back – “extraordinary,” “terrifying” and “uncharted territory” are just a few of the ways they have described the recent spike in global temperature.
This week, the planet’s average daily temperature soared to highs unseen in modern records kept by two climate agencies in the US and Europe.
While the records are based on data that only goes back to the mid-20th century, they are “almost certainly” the warmest the planet has seen over a much longer time period – “probably going back at least 100,000 years,” according to Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center.
And they were far from the only climate superlatives scientists have reported this year.
Last month, the world experienced its warmest June on record by a “substantial margin,” according to a report by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
Ocean heat has been off the charts, with surface temperatures last month reaching record levels for June. Parts of the North Atlantic have seen an “unprecedented” marine heat wave, with temperatures up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than usual.
And in Antarctica, where temperatures are running well-above average for this time of year, sea ice plunged to record low levels, which scientists have linked to the warm waters off the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
The world is “walking into an uncharted territory,” Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, told CNN. “We have never seen anything like this in our life.”
This is what global warming looks like
While scientists say the records are alarming, most are unsurprised – though frustrated their warnings have been mostly ignored for decades.
“This is exactly what we’ve been expecting to see for a long time,” Francis told CNN.
What the world is experiencing are the impacts of global warming combined with the El Niño climate phenomenon – the arrival of which the World Meteorological Organization officially confirmed on Wednesday.
It works like this: As the world burns fossil fuels and pumps out planet-heating pollution, global temperatures are steadily warming. That leads to more intense heat waves along with a host of other impacts, such as more extreme weather, melting glaciers and rising sea levels.
Superimposed on top of these long-term warming trends are natural climate fluctuations, the most significant of which are La Niña, which has a cooling effect, and El Niño, which has a heating effect.
“So we have a naturally warm world plus the increasingly hot climate change signal,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK.
While the record temperatures may have been expected, the magnitude by which some have been broken has surprised some scientists.
That this June was half a degree warmer than a typical June “is just extraordinary” for a global temperature record, said Buontempo. Usually these records – which are averages of temperatures all over the world for the entire month – are broken by a tenth or even hundredth of a degree.
Still others have been caught off guard by the nature of extreme weather events.
“We were expecting to see more and more frequent heat waves and floods and droughts around the world. But it’s the intensity of some of those events that is a bit surprising,” said Peter Stott, a science fellow in climate attribution at the UK’s Met Office.
There’s “an increasing worry that climate change is not quite as linear as we might have thought,” he told CNN. Scientists are trying to work out if weather patterns themselves might be changing, making heat waves much more intense than climate models predict.
Shaping up for the hottest year on record
While scientists cannot yet be definitive, some say this year is at least on pace to become the warmest on record.
The stars are aligning for the record to fall. Historically, global heat records tend to topple in El Niño years, and the current record-holder, 2016, coincided with a strong El Niño.
In May, a Berkeley Earth analysis put the chances of 2023 being the hottest on record at 54%. As last month turned out to be the hottest June on record, that percentage is going to increase, said Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth.
By how much remains uncertain, he told CNN, “but it’s looking more likely than not that 2023 will be a record year.”
Records are how the world keeps tabs on the climate crisis. Yet some scientists caution the attention given to these big numbers can overshadow the real-world hazards they amplify: Heat waves, floods and droughts becoming much more frequent, severe and long-lasting as the Earth heats up.
“It’s quite frustrating,” Otto said. The world gets hung up on blockbuster records but “these heat records are not exciting numbers,” she told CNN. “They mean that people and ecosystems are dying, that people are losing their livelihoods, that agricultural land will be unusable.”
The human impact of extreme weather this year has already been stark.
At the end of June, Texas and the South sweltered in a triple digit heat wave with extreme humidity that made temperatures feel even hotter and made it harder for bodies to cool themselves. The heat extended to Mexico, where extreme temperatures killed at least 112 people between March and the end of June.
China has been grappling with blistering temperatures for weeks. Beijing, which is facing one of its most brutal heat waves on record, saw temperatures soar past 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week.
In India, parts of the north have been struggling with unrelenting heat, while nearly half a million in the country’s northeast have been affected by severe flooding that has triggered devastating landslides which have taken lives.
“All of these kinds of extreme events are absolutely consistent with what we expect to see happening more often as we just continue to warm the globe,” Francis said.
And as El Niño strengthens, we’re likely to see more extreme weather, she added, not just in the summer but also in the winter, when El Niños have the biggest influence on Northern Hemisphere weather.
“I’d say buckle up.”
Unheeded warnings
For climate scientists, this is the “I told you so” moment they never wanted.
“This needn’t have been happening,” Stott said.
For decades, scientists have been warning about what would happen to global temperatures if the world failed to kick its fossil fuel habit and rein in planet-heating pollution. But they went unheeded, he said.
To see climate change unfold in front of us “is terrifying,” he added, because “this will just carry on getting worse and worse, and more and more extreme. So what we’re seeing now is only a foretaste of what could happen if efforts to reduce emissions aren’t successful.”
The only silver lining may be the records help raise alarm bells and persuade people to pressure political leaders to act, Otto said. “​​I hope that maybe more people will realize that this is really happening, and it’s really dangerous.”"
"This week’s record-breaking global temperatures are likely highest in ‘at least 100,000 years’",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/07/world/global-temps-warmest-on-record-climate/index.html,"This week’s record-breaking global temperatures are likely highest in ‘at least 100,000 years’
The planet’s temperature soared again on Thursday to levels not seen in the modern record-keeping era, marking the fourth straight day of record temperatures. These alarming new records are likely the highest temperatures in “at least 100,000 years,” one scientist told CNN.
The global average daily temperature climbed to 17.23 degrees Celsius (63.01 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, which uses data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction.
It’s been a week of record-breaking temperatures. On Monday, the average global temperature reached 17.01 degrees Celsius (62.62 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest in the NCEP’s data, which goes back to 1979. On Tuesday it climbed to 17.18 degrees Celsius, where it remained on Wednesday.
Before this week, the record in NCEP’s data was 16.92 degrees Celsius and was set in August 2016.
Though this week’s records are not yet official, another global climate tracking agency confirmed several in its own data. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said Monday’s and Tuesday’s global temperatures were also records in its data, which dates back to 1940.
While the records are based on observational data sets that only go back to the mid-20th century, they are “almost certainly” the warmest temperatures the planet has seen over a much longer time period, according to Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center.
Francis estimated that this week’s temperatures are the warmest “probably going back at least 100,000 years,” calling the records “a huge thing.”
Scientists know this because of the many millennia of climate data extracted from proxies like tree rings, ice cores and coral reefs – data that is a cornerstone to their understanding of the climate system and how humans have contributed to rapid global warming since the industrial revolution.
Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth who was one of the first to share that global temperatures were soaring this week, told CNN it’s very likely that “we’re going to keep seeing more of these records fall” this summer.
July is typically the planet’s hottest month, but temperatures are already in overdrive because of the combination of El Niño – a natural climate phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean – and the human-caused climate crisis, which is driving global temperatures steadily higher.
“It’s not a record to celebrate and it won’t be a record for long, with northern hemisphere summer still mostly ahead and El Niño developing,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK, said earlier this week.
“It just shows we have to stop burning fossil fuels, not in decades, now,” Otto said. Temperature records aren’t just numbers, “but for many people and ecosystems it’s a loss of life and livelihood.”

Global shipping industry climate pledge slammed as a ‘wishy washy’ compromise,https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/07/world/shipping-imo-climate-pledge-intl/index.html,"Global shipping industry climate pledge slammed as a ‘wishy washy’ compromise
The shipping industry has agreed a climate pledge to reduce its planet-heating pollution to net zero “by or around” 2050. While the agreement, published on Friday, marks an increased climate ambition from a hugely polluting industry, experts have slammed the deal as woefully inadequate in the face of an escalating climate crisis.
The shipping industry, which transports more than 80% of the world’s traded goods, produces around 3% of all human-caused planet-heating pollution due to the fossil fuels it uses to propel ships across the ocean.
But until now, the industry has not had a commitment to reach net zero – which would mean removing from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits.
That changed on Friday, when the International Maritime Organization, the UN body that regulates global shipping, published a new climate strategy after days of negotiations between the organization’s 175 member states.
In the new agreement – the 2023 IMO Strategy on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships – countries agreed shipping would reach net zero “by or around, i.e. close to 2050” depending on “national circumstances.”
The plan also includes interim commitments under the heading “indicative checkpoints,” where countries would aim to reduce planet-heating pollution from shipping by at least 20% by 2030 and 70% by 2040, compared to 2008 levels. The document also refers to “striving” targets of a 30% cut by 2030 and an 80% cut by 2040.
IMO secretary-general Kitack Lim said in a statement that the new climate strategy provides a “clear direction, a common vision, and ambitious targets.”
Industry groups welcomed the deal. In a statement, Simon Bennett, deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, said: “This week’s agreement is historic for our industry and sends a very strong message that the maritime sector is serious about achieving net zero and addressing dangerous climate change in line with the Paris Agreement.”
Some Pacific Island nations celebrated the adoption of new targets.
“These higher targets are the result of relentless, unceasing lobbying by ambitious Pacific islands, against the odds,” Albon Ishoda, special presidential envoy for the decarbonisation of maritime shipping from the Marshall Islands, said in a statement.
“This outcome is far from perfect, but countries across the world came together and got it done,” Ralph Regenvanu, a Vanuatu politician, said in a statement.
Many climate groups, however, were highly critical of what they see as a toothless plan and a missed opportunity.
Some countries and climate experts had been calling for much more ambitious targets including a commitment to reduce planet-heating pollution by up to 50% by 2030 and nearly completely by 2040.
John Maggs, the president of the Clean Shipping Coalition criticized the “vague and non-committal language” in the new climate strategy. “There is no excuse for this wish and a prayer agreement. They knew what the science required, and that a 50% cut in emissions by 2030 was both possible and affordable,” he said in a statement.
Faïg Abbasov, from the non profit Transport & Environment, said the agreement was a missed opportunity.  “This week’s climate talks were reminiscent of rearranging the deckchairs on a sinking ship. The IMO had the opportunity to set an unambiguous and clear course towards the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal, but all it came up with is a wishy-washy compromise,” he said in a statement.
Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key threshold, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
The IMO’s Lim said the strategy marked a “new chapter” for shipping, but added, “at the same time, it is not the end goal, it is in many ways a starting point for the work that needs to intensify even more over the years and decades ahead.”"
"El Niño is here and the world must prepare for more extreme heat, UN weather agency warns",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/world/wmo-el-nino-warmer-weather-climate-intl-hnk,"El Niño is here and the world must prepare for more extreme heat, UN weather agency warns
Governments must prepare for more extreme weather events and record temperatures in the coming months, the World Meteorological Organization warned Tuesday, as it declared the onset of the warming phenomenon El Niño.
El Niño is a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean that brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and has a major influence on weather across the globe, affecting billions of people.
“The onset of El Niño will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records and triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
The declaration “is the signal to governments around the world to mobilize preparations to limit the impacts on our health, our ecosystems and our economies.”
To save lives and livelihoods, governments must establish early warning systems and prepare for further disruptive weather events this year, he said.
The last three years have been some of the warmest on record, even with El Niño’s sister phase, La Niña – which is marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures.
A “double whammy” of a very strong El Niño and human-caused warming from the burning of fossil fuels led to 2016 becoming the hottest year on record, according to the WMO, the United Nations’ agency for weather, climate and water resources.
But the first El Niño to develop in seven years layered on top of human-caused global heating, could push 2023 or 2024 to break 2016’s heat record, the WMO said.
The WMO said there was a 90% probability of El Niño continuing during the second half of 2023 at moderate strength.
Along with increased ocean warming, El Niño events are usually associated with increased rainfall in parts of southern South America, the southern United States, the Horn of Africa and central Asia.
But it can also amplify severe droughts, heat waves and wildfires over Australia, Indonesia, parts of southern Asia, Central America and northern South America.
Other impacts include dangerous tropical cyclones in the Pacific and the mass bleaching of fragile coral reefs.
In India, a major rice producing nation, El Niño can weaken the monsoon that brings the rainfall the country relies on to fill aquifers and grow crops.
El Niño this year could also dent US economic growth, potentially impacting everything from food prices to winter clothing sales, a recent study found. The study attributed $5.7 trillion in global income losses to the 1997-98 El Niño and $4.1 trillion in losses to the 1982-83 El Niño.
The world could also be temporarily pushed past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels – a key tipping point beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. But the world has already seen around 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution.
According to the WMO there is a 66% likelihood that the annual average near-surface global temperature between 2023 and 2027 will temporarily be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels for at least one year.
“This is not to say that in the next five years we would exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement because that agreement refers to long-term warming over many years,” said WMO director of climate services Chris Hewitt.
“However, it is yet another wake up call, or an early warning, that we are not yet going in the right direction to limit the warming to within the targets set in Paris in 2015 designed to substantially reduce the impacts of climate change.”
A multitude of climate records have already been broken in 2023, with soaring temperatures, unusually hot oceans and record high levels of carbon pollution in the atmosphere and record low levels of Antarctic ice.
Across Asia, Europe and the Americas, early and prolonged heat waves this year have killed people, animals and crops, sparked concerns about food security and water scarcity, and set the stage for unprecedented wildfires.

Why nighttime heat can be so dangerous – and why it’s getting worse,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/weather/nighttime-heat-danger-climate-change-xpn-scn/index.html,"Why nighttime heat can be so dangerous – and why it’s getting worse
Summers are getting hotter than ever, shattering all-time high temperature records, straining the energy grid and damaging critical infrastructure.
Heat waves also are coming to include another increasingly dangerous element: overnight temperatures that don’t cool down enough to offer sufficient reprieve from oppressive heat, particularly for people without access to air conditioning.
“Most people don’t realize that hot nighttime temperatures have been outpacing daytime temperature increases across most populated regions worldwide in recent decades,” Columbia University’s Data Science Institute postdoctoral research scientist Kelton Minor told CNN.
Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis, scientists have warned. On average, nights are warming faster than days in most of the United States, the 2018 National Climate Assessment found.
“We think it’s because as the days grow warmer, there is more moisture in the air that traps the heat,” the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health’s executive director, Lisa Patel, told CNN. “During the day, that moisture reflects the heat, but at night, it traps the heat in.”
Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities because of the urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings.
Places with a lot of asphalt, concrete, buildings and freeways absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with ample parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. At night, when temperatures are supposed to cool down, the retained heat is released back into the air, said University of Washington climate and health expert Kristie Ebi.
Areas with a lot of green space – with grass and trees that reflect sunlight and create shade – are cooler on summer’s hottest days, she said.
“Many cities put together cooling shelters, but people have to know where they are, how to get to them and what hours they operate,” Ebi told CNN, noting city officials must rethink urban planning to consider climate change.
“It’s going to take a while for trees to grow, but we need tree-planting programs focusing on places that are particularly vulnerable, making sure that city planning takes into account that we’re heading into a much warmer future.”
Nighttime should be when our bodies get a break from the heat, Patel said. But with the climate crisis, it’s becoming less likely to happen. Heat-related deaths could increase sixfold by the end of the century due to warmer nighttime temperatures, unless planet-warming pollution is significantly curbed, a 2022 study in the Lancet Planetary Health found.
The climate crisis is already affecting people’s ability to sleep, said Minor, co-author of a study that found people living in warmer climates lose more sleep for each degree of temperature increase. It was published in May in the journal One Earth.
“We all know what it’s like to try to fall asleep on a hot night – it’s uncomfortable,” Patel said. “We often lose sleep. It is estimated that by the end of the century, we could lose about two days of sleep per year, and it will be worse for people without access to air conditioning.”
At its most extreme, when a human body does not get the chance to recover – typically at night – heat stress can progress to heat stroke, which is associated with confusion, dizziness and passing out, Patel explained.
People around the world are already losing roughly 44 hours of sleep every year on average due to warm nighttime temperatures during just the first part of the 21st century, Minor’s study estimated. He calls this “sleep erosion,” noting each person may lose up to 58 hours of sleep by the end of the century.
“People in our study did not appear to make up for lost sleep on hotter nights by napping during the day or by sleeping more during the days or weeks after,” Minor said. “In fact, they lost additional sleep over these periods due to a delayed temperature effect, possibly due to ambient heat being trapped indoors.”
And much like other social issues, the impacts don’t fall equally across communities, he said.
“For every degree of nighttime temperature rise, we found that the elderly lost over twice as much sleep as middle-aged adults, females lost slightly more sleep than males, and critically, residents of lower-middle-income countries lost three times as much sleep compared to people living in higher income countries,” Minor said.
Heat waves that go on for several days tend to be associated with more deaths as the body can no longer keep itself cool, Patel said.
And unless planet-warming pollution is curbed, the climate crisis is set to increase exposure to dangerous heat index levels by 50% to 100% in much of the tropics and by up to 10 times across much of the globe, according to a 2022 study published in Communications Earth & Environment.
“Living through a heat wave during the day can be like running a race,” Patel said. “We need a cool break to recover and recuperate, and when nighttime temperatures don’t drop, we don’t get that critical time we need to relieve the stress on our bodies from being overheated during the day.”"
"How storms will help bring an end to one heat wave, as another builds in the West",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/weather/heat-wave-west-south-friday/index.html,"How storms will help bring an end to one heat wave, as another builds in the West
A heat wave in parts of the South and Mississippi Valley is peaking and a new one is building in the West on Friday, putting more than 70 million people in those areas under heat alerts ahead of the holiday weekend.
More dangerous severe thunderstorms and areas of heavy rain along the northern side of the heat dome are forecast to track eastward from the Central Plains to the Ohio Valley and eventually the mid-Atlantic over the next couple of days, bringing some heat relief, but also the risk of damaging storms and additional power outages.
Oppressive heat smothers South
In the mid- to lower Mississippi River Valley and the Deep South, temperatures on Friday will again near or top 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; Little Rock, Arkansas; and New Orleans are under excessive heat warnings, as heat and humidity may combine to make temperatures feel like 105 to 115 degrees.
This continues distressing, deadly heat that parts of the South have experienced for days. Eleven people died in recent days due to heat-related illnesses in Texas’ Webb County, which includes Laredo, and at least two people died from the heat in Louisiana’s Caddo Parish this month, officials said.
Parts of Texas have sweltered under triple-digit temperatures for more than two weeks – but the state is seeing signs of relief. Dallas was not under any heat alert Friday morning as temperatures there dip to more typical summer values.
“Although a few locations across Central and East Texas may reach advisory criteria, the prevalence of 105 heat indices will be far less widespread, and our protracted stretch of advisories/warnings for heat will come to an end,” the National Weather Service office in Dallas said.
Heat across the rest of the South is expected to follow a similar pattern to Dallas, with slight relief slowly occurring over the holiday weekend.
“An increase in showers and thunderstorms this weekend into next week during peak heating will bring some relief from the heat as the upper-level ridge weakens slightly across the region,” the National Weather Service office in Memphis said.
Storms will tame temps this weekend
Rounds of storms each day “will begin to erode the upper ridge (heat dome) responsible for the ongoing heat wave across the South and help bringing cooler air ever so slowly east across the Central Plains,” the Weather Prediction Center said Friday morning.
But the trade-off is rounds of dangerous storms.
Damaging winds and large hail are the main threats today as storms move around the periphery of the heat dome parked over the South. Denver, Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, are in a Level 1 of 5 risk on Friday.
A level 2 of 5 slight risk of severe storms stretches from Colorado to Kentucky on Friday, including Colorado Springs, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Nashville, Tennessee.
Thunderstorm complexes with heavy downpours, hail and damaging wind gusts will develop over the mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
On Saturday, a level 3 of 5 enhanced risk of severe storms covers portions of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, including St. Louis and Louisville. Damaging winds and large hail are the most likely threat with these storms. A Level 2 of 5 risk stretches farther east to the Virginias, Carolinas and Georgia.
By Sunday, storms look to target the Ohio Valley into the mid-Atlantic where a Level 2 of 5 risk is already highlighted. Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Indianapolis are included.
Southwest bakes as new heat wave builds
As parts of the South begin to see some relief, heat in the West is building.
Millions across Las Vegas and Phoenix will be under excessive heat warnings beginning Saturday, with temperatures projected to soar above 110 degrees for both locations this weekend. And many parts of California are under excessive heat warnings or heat advisories.
Las Vegas has gone a record-breaking 293 consecutive days without reaching 100 degrees, but is forecast to top 100 degrees today, and shoot up to 110 degrees by Sunday and beyond.
“This heat should be taken seriously and precautions need to be taken to prevent heat-related illnesses,” the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas warned. “Avoid outdoor activity during the hottest parts of the day (10 a.m. - 4 p.m.), drink extra water, take breaks in cool or shady locations, and wear light colored, light weight clothing.”
More than 600 people in the US are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As human-induced climate change forces temperatures to rise around the globe, officials urge people to take safety precautions during heat waves, including staying hydrated, avoiding leaving pets and kids in cars unattended and finding cool, indoor spaces to wait out the high temperatures.

"The mosquito era: As the world warms, these insects are thriving – and bringing disease",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/world/mosquitoes-spread-climate-dengue-malaria-scn/index.html,"The mosquito era: As the world warms, these insects are thriving – and bringing disease
There are very few winners in the climate crisis, but scientists are pretty sure there’s going to be at least one: Mosquitoes.
These insects – annoying at best, deadly at worst – thrive in warmth and humidity. As climate change ushers in more frequent and more severe heat waves, as well as storms and floods that leave behind pools of stagnant water in which most breed, it’s boom time for mosquitoes.
For the first time in decades, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of several locally acquired cases of malaria in the United States – news that has thrust mosquitoes into the spotlight. While it’s too soon to know whether these specific cases are connected to climate change, scientists have been warning that malaria could become more common in the US as temperatures rise there.
It has raised fresh concerns about mosquitoes pushing into regions they have not been in for generations – or ever – and what that might mean for the spread of the deadly diseases they transmit.
Rising temperatures allow mosquitoes to grow faster and live longer. Whereas before they would die out during harsh winters in many places, now they have a greater shot at surviving and more time to build up their populations. Heat also speeds up the time it takes for a parasite or virus to mature inside a mosquito.
“The hotter the temperature gets, the shorter that process becomes. So not only are these mosquitoes living longer, but they’re potentially becoming infectious sooner,” said Oliver Brady, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
They gain other benefits from heat, too. When it’s hotter, more people tend to be outside in the morning and late in the afternoon – prime time for mosquitoes.
Heat is also pushing cities to increase their amount of green space, which has a vital cooling effect but could also provide ideal new breeding grounds for the blood-sucking insects.
In the US, the number of “mosquito days” – those with the hot and humid conditions they love – has increased across the country, according to a recent analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group.
Researchers looked at data spanning more than four decades in nearly 250 locations and found that more than 70% of them had become more hospitable to mosquitoes.
While most of the approximately 200 mosquito species in the US are harmless, there are about a dozen which can pass on diseases to humans, including chikungunya, dengue, zika and West Nile viruses.
While serious mosquito-borne diseases recmain rare in the US, other countries are not so lucky.
In sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria has had devastating consequences, climate change is helping mosquitoes expand their range significantly, according to recent research.
Malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes have, on average, moved to higher elevations by around 21 feet a year and southward by nearly 3 miles a year, a Georgetown University report found.
It’s a pace that follows climate change and could have significant consequences for areas that have never experienced malaria before and are likely to be unprepared, said Colin Carlson, a global change biologist at Georgetown University and co-author of the report.
Dengue fever is another potentially deadly disease, which is poised to increase in a warmer world.
Also known as “breakbone fever,” it causes fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea and, in some cases, internal bleeding and death. There is no cure or specific treatment for dengue, leaving sufferers little choice but to ride out the symptoms.
Peru is currently grappling with the worst outbreak of mosquito-borne dengue fever on record, which has infected around 150,000 people and killed more than 250.
Experts have said that unusually high levels of rainfall and warmth have provided ideal conditions for the mosquitoes. While scientists are yet to assess the role climate change has played in the outbreak, Carlson said the links seem clear.
“I’m not a betting man, and I would put money on when we go and do that study, it will be climate change,” he said.
Now dengue is knocking on the door of Europe and the US.
“A billion new people will be exposed to the right weather conditions for dengue transmission, and most of those people are in Western Europe and the United States and temperate China,” said Carlson.
There have been locally spread outbreaks in Texas, Florida, Hawaii and Arizona. And last week, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warned that the Aedes albopictus species – which can transmit dengue and chikungunya – is pushing northwards and westwards in Europe as climate change grips the world’s fastest warming continent.
“What is surprising is the speed of the spread,” Celine Gossner, principal expert in emerging and vector-borne diseases at the ECDC, told CNN. In just a decade, the number of regions where this mosquito is established has increased three-fold, she said.
Even with this new exposure, however, the US and Europe are unlikely to see huge outbreaks, or large numbers of fatalities from dengue virus.
“The story of future change is really more about big increases in areas that already have dengue, that’s going to get much worse,” Brady said. He pointed to China and parts of India as particularly at risk. “That’s a really scary situation because vast numbers of people live in these areas and even minor changes could potentially be catastrophic,” he said.
Communities already on the front lines of the climate crisis are always going to be most affected by mosquito-borne disease, and that is where investment should be directed, said Shannon LaDeau, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystems Studies.
But the shift of mosquito-borne diseases into regions like the US and Europe is still likely to be a shock.
“Folks that live in the temperate zone are going to see their way of life change pretty dramatically because they’ve never had to worry about it before,” LaDeau told CNN.
The climate crisis is not all upside for mosquitoes. Some places may simply be getting too hot.
“There’s some threshold after which the chemistry in their body just doesn’t function anymore,” LaDeau said. The bad news is that these places are likely to be getting too hot for humans, too.
There is still much that remains unknown about how mosquitoes will react to the climate crisis. The relationship between climate change and disease is complex, Gossner said.
We know a lot about how temperature changes mosquitoes’ ability to transmit disease, a small amount about how quickly mosquitoes are moving to new places and very little about whether overall mosquito populations are growing, Carlson said.
Scientists are working to develop tools to be able to better assess the link between mosquito-borne diseases and climate change.
In the meantime, there are ways people can protect themselves from risk, including wearing mosquito repellent, putting screens on windows and doors and getting rid of any stagnant water from places like flowerpots and gutters.
Scientists are also working on high-tech methods to reduce populations. A project in Florida has been trialing a genetically modified mosquito designed to pass on a lethal gene that kills female mosquitoes – which are the ones that bite.
Other experiments involve using wolbachia bacteria, which can prevent viruses replicating inside a mosquito, making them less likely to transmit viruses.
There are also vaccines on the horizon for diseases such as dengue and malaria. “That’s a really big deal,” said Carlson. But whether these will be shared equitably around the world is another question, he added.
“It’s a long road to try to understand how better to use those tools. But there’s a lot of hope on the horizon,” Brady said.
Ultimately, tackling climate change will have a huge impact.
The path the world takes on reducing planet-heating pollution will lead to very different futures for mosquito-borne diseases, Brady said. “Aggressive [climate] mitigation would be by far the lowest risk.”"

Climate event El Niño could hit the economy from food prices to clothing sales this year
Earlier this month, scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that the climate event known as El Niño has officially emerged for the first time in more than four years, and it’s expected to be strong this time around.
The phenomenon generally has a wide-ranging impact on weather conditions for 9-12 months. But that’s not the only effects expected: Combined with climate change, El Niño this year could dent US economic growth, potentially impacting everything from food prices to the winter clothing sales.
“There are these major negative economic growth consequences where there’s extreme weather,” said Christopher Callahan, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth and lead author on a study in the journal Science attributing $5.7 trillion in global income losses to the 1997-98 El Niño and $4.1 trillion in losses to the 1982-1983 El Niño.
Countries can feel the negative affects of these climate patterns years after they end, the study found.
“The effects of these events last a long time, and they are far more costly than we used to think,” Christopher Callahan, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth and lead author of the study, said.
What is El Niño?
El Niño, part of a larger pattern called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is a naturally occurring climate system marked by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, and it appears every 2-7 years, according to NOAA.
That can result in more typhoons and cyclones in the Pacific, said Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, a professor at the University of Vermont who studies climate variability and change. And, because weather systems are complex, that can also suppress hurricane activity in the Atlantic, she noted.
But El Niño’s potentially dramatic impact stretches far beyond the Pacific Ocean. Jin-Yi Yu, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of California Irvine, said the climate pattern usually results in “abnormal” weather patterns, including droughts in typically rainy southeast Asia and Australia, and rainfall in the normally arid deserts of the Southwestern United States.
The climate event’s impact will become more apparent in the US by late fall: Winters are generally warmer in the north of the United States and colder and rainier in the south during El Niño, Yu said.
Food, tourism and retail industries may be affected
Callahan said extreme weather associated with El Niño causes flooding, wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters.
That could affect prices for foods Americans eat every day: Futures in sugar and cocoa are trading at multi-year highs on predictions of shortages, while robusta coffee futures are trading at all-time highs. That can translate into higher prices for chocolate, for coffee and more. Higher food prices are a common theme across El Niño events, according to a recent Deutsche Bank report.
The effects go beyond farms. Simeon Siegel, an analyst analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said unexpected swings in weather can negatively impact the retail sector.
“Although no retailer ever wants to blame the weather because it comes off as an excuse, weather is absolutely critical for most retail, particularly apparel and seasonal goods,” he said.
“Not only must the retailers or brands forecast what consumers will want, they also need to predict what nature is going to throw at them. Obviously, for companies that sell coats, grills, outdoor furniture, sweaters, or shorts, the weather can be the difference between needing to buy that coat or not,” he added.
The travel and tourism sector may also feel the sting of El Niño. For a 2021 study in the scientific journal Atmosphere, researchers analyzed the number of visits to 48 natural attractions in the United States to test willingness to travel during El Niño events. The research concluded that these weather events led to a “significant decrease” in tourist visits.
El Niño conditions also tend to amplify hurricane-like storms in the Pacific Ocean, according to Dupigny-Giroux.
In fact, according to the Deutsche Bank report, “The Pacific hurricane season saw 16 hurricanes in each of 2014 and 2015, the joint highest number on record.”
A repeat could prove to be a headache for airline companies, which are already struggling with weather-related cancellations and disruptions this summer. Inclement weather is “by far, the largest cause of flight delays,” according to the US Federal Aviation Administration.
A silver lining?
However, El Niño could bring benefits to some areas.
Chris Scheuring, a water attorney for the California Farm Bureau, said his state would welcome a rainy season after battling years-long droughts in the past.
“A wet year in general on this landscape is very good. The reservoirs refill themselves, the aquifers bounce back a little bit, and the snowpack is great. That’s a very good thing,” he said.
“It’s almost always a good thing for farming, except for those folks that suffer flood-related impacts,” he added.
To be sure, not every El Niño is guaranteed to significantly impact the weather, according to Dupigny-Giroux. “Everything is looking like we will go into at least a weak or moderately strong one, but no one is hanging their hat to say it’s a guarantee right now,” she said.
The last time there was an El Niño in 2018 through 2019, NOAA dubbed it “The Great Puny El Niño” due to its relatively weak impact on weather conditions.
However, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center recently said there were “pretty good” odds that this El Niño event will strengthen at its peak, and Dupigny-Giroux said climate change may intensify some of the resulting weather events.
“A lot of times when you hear the term climate change, you think about air temperatures, but for these types of systems, ocean temperatures are critically important, and additional warming in the air is actually being stored in the oceans,” she said.
“That means the oceans are going to be warmer, which then allow for more potential storm systems to occur.”
Callahan’s research for Dartmouth estimates that amplified El Niño patterns could produce “potentially devastating socioeconomic impacts” in the coming decades. He projects that El Niño weather events could cause $84 trillion in economic losses in the 21st century.

Opinion: The smoky air you’re breathing is a warning sign,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/28/opinions/biden-climate-change-canada-wildfires-environment-zelizer/index.html,"Opinion: The smoky air you’re breathing is a warning sign
Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author and editor of 25 books, including the New York Times best-seller, “Myth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past” (Basic Books). Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
People in vast swathes of America are breathing in the smoky air from Canada’s record-breaking wildfires. Residents of Chicago, Detroit and other areas in the Great Lakes region woke up to poor air quality this week. They are experiencing the unsettling fog that New Yorkers lived through a few weeks ago, which was eerily reminiscent of the pandemic: Broadway shows were closed, masks were on faces and many city streets were emptied.
And smoke is expected to make a return visit to the mid-Atlantic on Thursday.
Scientists have pointed out that this summer’s air quality problems are connected to the climate change crisis we have been facing for decades. Wildfires will become increasingly common as temperatures rise, producing greater bouts of drought and drier air.
Opinion: How I talk to my kids about climate change
Moments such as these require the government to take action to help protect Americans from the dangers of smog and other climate issues. The government has a wide array of tools at its disposal, from air quality tracking technology to large caches of medical supplies, which can limit the damage.
But this moment also presents an important governing opportunity for elected officials who have struggled to build political support for bold climate change measures that would get to the root of some of these issues.
President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act contained some of the most sweeping climate change measures that the nation has seen. As a result of this act, and key programs in other legislation passed during his tenure, the federal government is investing billions in transportation infrastructure connected to flooding and providing over a billion dollars to diminish the risks of wildfires and bolster forest health, which includes better pay for firefighters as well as drought mitigation.
The president was recently in California boasting about what he had done. Yet Biden would undoubtedly be the first to admit that Washington has a long way to go. The legislation was a first step towards reducing emissions, but it was only a single step towards addressing the immense policy needs that will be required to save the planet and ourselves.
One of the most difficult elements of climate change is that the threat feels remote and abstract for many Americans. Traditionally, our slow-moving political process responds best when there is an immediate crisis at hand.
Opinion: A Californian’s message to East Coasters struggling in smoke-filled air
The impetus for legislation, as Princeton University doctoral student Robert Oldham is discovering in his research, often comes from constituents who demand immediate action on an issue they deem important — often with the help of ongoing media coverage. For their elected officials, doing nothing could mean political fallout.
In recent years, however, as with the air quality, there have been more concrete examples —wildfires, flooding, beach erosion, intense heat and more — of what climate change is doing to our world.
There are many cases of legislation requiring a tangible crisis in the lives of Americans to stir Congress to action. During the 1930s, the federal government finally tackled problems such as unemployment insurance and rural electrification – only after the bottom fell out for most families as a result of the Great Depression.
President John F. Kennedy, who resisted moving on civil rights legislation in the first two years of his presidency, finally sent a bill to Congress after activists such as Martin Luther King Jr. had exposed to the nation, through protests in cities such as Birmingham, what racism really looked like in the Deep South.
During the late 1940s, the federal government only moved to reorganize and vastly expand its national security apparatus and defense spending after the very real threats of the Cold War were felt on the home-front: the peril of a communist superpower armed with atomic and nuclear weapons.
It was only after the deadly attack by al-Qaeda on our nation in 2001 that the government finally bolstered airport security, even though policymakers had spent endless hours criticizing the lax oversight we had depended on.
Most recently, it took a devastating global pandemic to shake elected officials into taking a serious look at our public health system. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan, both of which included much-needed investments for dealing with pandemics, didn’t pass Congress until 2020 and 2021, respectively. It took a major pandemic to pressure Congress into passing legislation that could help prevent another.
Governing through crisis is not the best way to handle long-term problems, but it is the way we will likely be spurred into legislative action, at least for the foreseeable future.
Importantly, crises don’t automatically translate into government action. This is where presidential leadership can matter. The smoke from wildfires enables leaders to connect the dots for voters. Doing so is not politicizing these situations but rather exercising leadership to address the root causes of an issue.
Millions of Americans are feeling the painful and immediate effects of environmental degradation. For too long we have been sitting still. We can’t afford to do so any longer."
How can people stay healthy in hot weather? Our medical analyst explains,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/28/health/heat-hot-weather-safety-wellness/index.html,"How can people stay healthy in hot weather? Our medical analyst explains
Over 50 million people in the southern United States will be under oppressive heat conditions this week. The temperature is expected to climb over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37.8 degrees Celsius, for several days. The heat index, which takes into account air temperature and humidity and is colloquially known as the “feels like” temperature, could soar to over 125 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 51.6 degrees Celsius.
As the temperatures rise, there are health concerns associated with extreme heat, including heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Who is most vulnerable, and what steps can people take if a heat wave is expected in their area? Are there specific precautions that the elderly and families with young children should take? And how can everyone prepare for hot weather events outdoors?
To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as health commissioner of Baltimore, where her duties included overseeing the city’s “Code Red” responses to extreme hot weather.
CNN: What are health concerns associated with extreme heat?
Dr. Leana Wen: High temperatures that come with extreme heat can have many serious and harmful health effects. When someone’s body temperature rises as a result of exposure to extreme heat, they could experience heatstroke, which is a medical emergency. Individuals with heatstroke have body temperatures above 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Their bodies stop being able to cool effectively, and they may become confused and dizzy. They have changes in their heart rate, and they may faint. These individuals need immediate cooling and emergency medical care; indeed, heatstroke can be fatal. Less severe heat-related illnesses include heat exhaustion, which can progress to heatstroke, and heat cramps, which are often associated with exercising in hot weather.
In addition to the direct health effects, high temperatures can also put strain on the heart and lungs. The interaction of heat and cardiovascular disease was either the direct or contributory cause in 1 in 4 heat-related deaths since 1999, according to data from the US Environmental Protection Agency. Higher temperatures are also associated with particle and ozone pollution, which have negative health effects, too.
CNN: What are symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke?
Wen: Symptoms of heat exhaustion include headache, nausea, dizziness, weakness, elevated body temperature and decreased urination. Heat exhaustion is often seen in people working or performing fitness activities for prolonged periods of time in hot environments. If someone is suspected to have heat exhaustion, they should be cooled by getting out of the sun and ideally into a cool, air-conditioned space. Cold compresses and cold drinks will help, too. If the person appears to be confused, fainting or getting worse, call 911 (in the US).
Heatstroke is the medical emergency I referenced above. Immediate medical care is essential, and bystanders should not hesitate to call 911 when they suspect heatstroke.
CNN: Who’s most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, and what steps can they take if a heat wave is forecast in their area?
Wen: Individuals most vulnerable are the elderly and the very young; those with significant underlying medical conditions; and people with social situations that make them more prone to experiencing the harms of extreme weather.
Elderly individuals have decreased capacity to adapt to changes in body temperature and are also at higher risk of dehydration. The same goes for young children, who have less physiological reserve and may not be able to reliably report how they are feeling. Individuals with chronic medical conditions are also more susceptible to the added strain placed on them by heat-related illnesses.
These more vulnerable individuals should use extra caution during hot weather events. Limit time outdoors when it’s very hot outside. Certainly, do so if your local official has issued a heat advisory, but even if they have not, know your own limits when the weather starts heating up.
In extreme heat, here are 14 ways to keep your body and home cool without AC
Try to move fitness activities inside, or if they must be outside, do them in the early mornings or evenings. If you have to be out during the heat of the day, try to stay in the shade. Make sure to use sun protection and drink plenty of fluids. If you start developing any symptoms, like headaches, dizziness, muscle cramps, lack of energy or tiredness, get out of the sun and go inside to cool, air-conditioned places immediately.
The other group that’s highly vulnerable are individuals who have specific social circumstances. People experiencing homelessness, for example, or those living without air conditioning, are at high risk because they may not have the option to seek cooler shelter. They should seek out resources from their local and state government, which may provide cooling centers and temporary shelters during periods of extreme hot weather. People who must work outdoors should also use caution as much as possible, including staying well hydrated and aiming to do activities that require heaviest exertion during times of the day when it’s not as hot.
CNN: Are there specific precautions that families with young children should take?
Wen: First, recognize that young kids often lack the ability to report their symptoms. Children may also become overly excited and want to play outside, even if they are overheating. And they may forget to drink fluids. Especially if you live in environments where your children are not used to hot weather, monitor them closely. Make sure they are drinking plenty of water, and consider setting a time limit of 15 to 20 minutes outside in the heat, at which point they must come in and cool down.
What scientists say keeps mosquitoes at bay
Second, make sure never to leave kids or pets in the car. The inside of cars heats up rapidly, and sadly, over 38 children die in overheated cars every year in the US. Even if you are running a short errand, take children with you and don’t leave them unattended in a closed car.
CNN: How can everyone prepare for hot weather events?
Wen: In addition to taking steps to prevent heat-related illnesses, everyone should prepare in advance and have contingency plans. For example, if your home’s air conditioning stops working, could you go to a relative’s house or a neighbor’s? Also, what are other weather emergencies that could happen in your area and what will you do if, say, a tornado warning is in effect? Finally, everyone should have a “go bag” of emergency supplies that’s ready for use. Be sure to communicate these plans with your family so that everyone knows what to do."
"Texas’s nighttime temperatures are a symptom of a new, more dangerous kind of heat wave",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/27/weather/texas-heat-wave-nighttime-temperatures-climate/index.html,"Texas’s nighttime temperatures are a symptom of a new, more dangerous kind of heat wave
A brutal heat wave is expanding across Texas and the South this week, impacting millions of Americans with triple-digit temperatures and extreme humidity that is cranking up the heat index, making it feel hotter than 110 degrees in some of the region’s most populous cities.
But forecasters are warning that there is a more dangerous aspect to this heat wave, and one that is becoming more common because of the climate crisis: overnight temperatures are not cooling down enough, offering little reprieve from the oppressive heat — particularly for people who don’t have access to air conditioning.
The National Weather Service highlighted the insidious nature of this week’s heat wave in a statement on Monday, when forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center noted “there may be more danger than a typical heat event, due to the longevity of near-record or record high nighttime lows and elevated heat index readings.”
Overnight temperature records are expected to far outpace daytime records this week. Around 90 afternoon high-temperature records could be broken across the South, from Texas to the Mississippi Valley and parts of Florida, according to data from the National Weather Service.
But overnight temperatures will also stay abnormally high, with potentially 180 nighttime records broken over the next seven days.
Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis, scientists have warned. On average, nights are warming faster than days in most of the US, according to the 2018 National Climate Assessment.
“We think it’s because as the days grow warmer, there is more moisture in the air that traps the heat,” Lisa Patel, the executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, told CNN. “During the day, that moisture reflects the heat, but at night, it traps the heat in.”
Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities because of the urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings.
Dallas, for example, is set to go six consecutive days without seeing temperatures drop below 80 degrees Fahrenheit overnight — a June record for the city.
Areas with a lot of asphalt, concrete, buildings and freeways absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. At night, when temperatures are supposed to cool down, the retained heat is released back into the air, said Kristie Ebi, a climate and health expert at the University of Washington.
Areas with a lot of green space – with grass and trees that reflect sunlight and create shade – are cooler on summer’s hottest days.
“Many cities put together cooling shelters, but people have to know where they are, how to get to them and what hours they operate,” Ebi told CNN, noting that city officials need to rethink urban planning to consider climate change.
“It’s going to take a while for trees to grow, but we need tree planting programs focusing on places that are particularly vulnerable — making sure that city planning takes into account that we’re heading into a much warmer future.”
Houston has had nine days far this month that haven’t dropped below 80 degrees — nearly double what’s typical for June. This has only happened two other times in the city’s records.
Nighttime should be when our bodies are given a break from the heat, Patel said. But with climate change, that’s becoming less likely to happen. A recent study found that heat-related deaths could increase six-fold by the end of the century due to warmer nighttime temperatures, unless planet-warming pollution is significantly curbed.
Researchers have also warned the climate crisis is already affecting people’s ability to sleep. A study published last month found that people living in warmer climates lose more sleep for each degree of temperature increase.
“We all know what it’s like to try to fall asleep on a hot night — it’s uncomfortable,” Patel said. “We often lose sleep. It is estimated that by the end of the century, we could lose about two days of sleep per year, and it will be worse for people without access to air conditioning.”
Patel explains that at its most extreme, when a human body does not get the chance to recover — typically at night — heat stress can progress to heat stroke, which is associated with confusion, dizziness and passing out.
And while this can happen to anyone, she said the impacts are more amplified on the elderly, people with chronic underlying health conditions, and young children, particularly infants. Heat waves that go on for several days tend to be associated with more deaths as the body can no longer keep itself cool.
“Living through a heat wave during the day can be like running a race,” Patel said. “We need a cool break to recover and recuperate, and when nighttime temperatures don’t drop, we don’t get that critical time we need to relieve the stress on our bodies from being overheated during the day.”

Humans approaching limits of ‘survivability’ as sweltering heatwaves engulf parts of Asia,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/26/india/india-heatwave-extreme-weather-rain-intl-hnk/index.html,"Humans approaching limits of ‘survivability’ as sweltering heatwaves engulf parts of Asia
Heavy showers blanketed northern India over the weekend, offering some much needed respite from a blistering heatwave that ravaged the region. But with mercury levels expected to remain high in other areas, the soaring heat has highlighted how millions in the world’s most populous nation are among the most vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis.
The weekend downpour in Uttar Pradesh was a welcome change for the northern state of 220 million after temperatures in some areas soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) last week, sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses.
On Sunday, temperatures dropped acutely in Lucknow to around 32 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit), as the capital, along with other cities, experienced the first rain during this year’s monsoon season. Video broadcast on local television showed people getting soaked in the rain and commuters navigating waterlogged roads.
The rain in Uttar Pradesh is likely to continue this week, bringing cooler temperatures to the region. But in the neighboring state of Bihar, unrelenting heat has extended into its second week, forcing schools to shutter until Wednesday.
At least 44 people have died from heat-related illness across the state in recent weeks, a senior health official told CNN, but the number could be much higher as authorities struggle to accurately assess how many people have died from heatstroke.
Temperatures are expected to slightly cool over the coming days, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), however experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heatwaves in the future, testing India’s ability to adapt.
“India has a history of dealing with heat… There are going to be millions affected,” said Dr. Chandni Singh, Senior Researcher at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements, adding the number of deaths that will be result from staggering heat depends on how prepared health systems are to deal with it.
“If health systems aren’t functioning, when you don’t have adequate emergency services, it will lead to (more deaths),” she said. “But what we know for certain is we are going to be approaching limits to survivability by mid-century.”
India is not the only country in the region to experience such sweltering heat in recent weeks.
Temperatures in northeast China are expected to remain high in the coming days, with mercury levels rising above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in certain cities, according to its meteorological observatory.
In Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, temperatures soared to 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) last week before weekend rain brought some relief to the region.
And studies warn the impact of extreme heat could be devastating.
Prolonged heat
India often experiences heatwaves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged.
Last April, India experienced a heatwave which saw temperatures in capital New Delhi go beyond 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) for seven consecutive days. In some states, the heat closed schools, damaged crops and put pressure on energy supplies, as officials warned residents to remain indoors and keep hydrated.
India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide.
And experts say the the cascading effects of this will be devastating.
A study published in April by the University of Cambridge said heatwaves in India are putting “unprecedented burdens” on India’s agriculture, economy and public health systems, stalling efforts to reach its development goals.
“Long-term projections indicate that Indian heatwaves could cross the survivability limit for a healthy human resting in the shade by 2050,” the study said. “They will impact the labor productivity, economic growth, and quality of life of around 310 - 480 million people. Estimates show a 15% decrease in outdoor working capacity during daylight hours due to extreme heat by 2050.”
Singh said India has already taken steps to mitigate the impacts of high temperatures, including altering working hours for some outdoor workers and increasing heat education.
But the effects of extreme heat will impact our environment, energy consumption and eco-systems, she warned.
“Typically in a heatwave, you also see related water scarcity and droughts. You see the failure of the electricity grid. These risks start stressing the entire system,” she said. “Crop productivity will get affected. There will be huge impacts on other animals. When we come up with heat reduction plans, these are all things that are important to remember.”
Extremes of weather
India’s heatwave in the north came as heavy rain battered the country’s northeast, with pre-monsoon rain in Assam state triggering landslides and heavy flooding.
Nearly half a million people have been affected after heavy showers battered the region, turning roads into rivers and submerging entire villages. The rain in Assam came one week after after tropical cyclone Biparjoy hit India’s west coast, ripping trees and toppling electricity poles.
Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan also saw heavy rain in capital Islamabad over the weekend, bringing some relief from the high temperatures the week prior.
The rain may cause urban flooding in key cities, the country’s weather forecasting center said, advising farmers to manage their crops and encouraging travelers to remain cautious.
China is expected to see soaring temperatures across several cities, including capital Beijing.
Last week, Beijing’s temperature soared above 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit), setting a new record for the capital’s hottest day in June.
According to the country’s meteorological observatory, Beijing, Tianjin, Heibei, Shandong will “continue to be baked by high temperatures.”

The North Atlantic is experiencing a ‘totally unprecedented’ marine heat wave,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/europe/marine-heatwave-north-atlantic-climate-scn-intl,"The North Atlantic is experiencing a ‘totally unprecedented’ marine heat wave
Temperatures in parts of the North Atlantic Ocean are soaring off the charts, with an “exceptional” marine heat wave happening off the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland, sparking concerns about impacts on marine life.
Parts of the North Sea are experiencing a category 4 marine heat wave – defined as “extreme” – according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In some areas, water temperatures are up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 Fahrenheit) hotter than usual.
Global oceans have been exceptionally warm for months. April and May saw the highest ocean surface temperatures for those two months since records began in 1850.
The regional picture is even more stark, according to the UK Met Office: Temperatures in the North Atlantic in May were around 1.25 degrees Celsius (2.25 Fahrenheit) above average.
“The eastern Atlantic, from Iceland down to the tropics, is much warmer than average. But areas around parts of north-western Europe, including parts of the UK, have among some of the highest sea-surface temperatures relative to average,” Stephen Belcher, the Met Office’s chief scientist, said in a statement.
Many scientists are sounding the alarm.
The heatwave is “very exceptional,” said Mika Rantanen, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. It is “currently the strongest on Earth,” he told CNN.
Richard Unsworth, an associate professor of biosciences at Swansea University in the UK and a founding director of Project-Seagrass, called the Atlantic heat wave “totally unprecedented.”
It is “way beyond the worst-case predictions for the changing climate of the region. It’s truly frightening how fast this ocean basin is changing,” he told CNN.
Risks are high for marine species, such as fish, coral and seagrass – many of which adapted to survive within certain temperature ranges. Hotter water can stress and even kill them.
“There’s a very high potential that animals such as oysters, plants and algae will be killed by this European marine heatwave, particularly within shallow waters where temperatures may super heat beyond the background levels,” Unsworth said.
Earlier this month, thousands of dead fish washed up along the Gulf Coast in Texas, a mass death which scientists believe is connected to rising ocean temperatures, as warmer water is able to hold less oxygen. And in 2021, an extreme heat wave cooked around a billion shellfish to death on Canada’s West Coast.
Scientists say there are a number of factors behind the extreme heat.
“It is the classic combination of the underpinning of human-caused climate change with a layer of natural variation within the climate system on top,” the UK Met Office said in a statement.
Planet-heating pollution rises as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, which means higher temperatures for oceans and land.
El Niño, which tends to have a warming effect globally, is expected to drive temperatures even higher this year.
And other factors may also play a role, including a lack of dust from the Sahara, which usually helps cool the region by reflecting away sunlight. “Weaker than average winds have reduced the extent of dust in the region’s atmosphere potentially leading to higher temperatures,” said Albert Klein Tank, the head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, in a statement.
Weaker winds may also have helped increase temperatures, as strong westerly winds typically cool the ocean surface, Rantanen said.
Another potential driver of ocean heat could be anti-pollution regulations which require ships to cut sulfur in their fuel, reducing aerosols in the atmosphere. While these aerosols have a negative impact on human health, they also have a cooling impact by reflecting away sunlight.
As climate change intensifies, marine heat waves are set to become more common. The frequency of marine heat waves has already increased more than 20-fold due to human-caused global warming, according to a 2020 study.
“While we can’t in detail predict the intensity, duration and location of severe heating events such as the current marine heatwave, we know they’re increasingly likely to be more prevalent as our climate system collapses further,” Unsworth said."
"Heat, drought and fire: Europe’s year of extremes in 2022 will not be a ‘one-off,’ new report finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/19/europe/europe-state-of-climate-heat-drought-intl/index.html,"Heat, drought and fire: Europe’s year of extremes in 2022 will not be a ‘one-off,’ new report finds
The climate crisis is taking an enormous toll on Europe, which was ravaged by extreme heat, drought, wildfires and glacier melt last year, a new analysis has concluded.
A joint report by the World Meteorological Organization and the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found that last summer was the hottest on record for Europe and caused more than 16,000 excess deaths, according to the report.
“Unfortunately, this cannot be considered a one-off occurrence or an oddity of the climate,” said Carlo Buontempo, the director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement. He added that current understanding of the climate system “informs us that these kinds of events are part of a pattern that will make heat stress extremes more frequent and more intense across the region.”
Several countries, including the UK, Spain, Switzerland and Italy, saw their hottest years on record in 2022.
Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world, according to the report, and has been warming twice as fast as the global average for the last four decades.
The continent was not only hot but also extremely dry, with big implications for agriculture and water supply. Many parts of the continent saw very low levels of precipitation last year, with France experiencing its driest January-to-September period on record. In Spain, water reserves plunged to just over 40% of capacity, the report found.
Persistent drought and high temperatures fueled intense wildfires. Europe experienced the second-largest burned area on record in 2022, the report found, with Central Europe and the Mediterranean, in particular, seeing large areas scorched by fire.
Glaciers in the European Alps had a bad year, experiencing a record loss of ice mass due to low snowfall, warm temperatures and Saharan dust, which makes glaciers darker, meaning they absorb more heat and melt faster.
And oceans were unusually warm, with average sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic the hottest on record. Rates of warming in parts of the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic and Black Seas, and the southern Arctic were more than three times the global average, the report found.
With the arrival of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon with a global warming effect, many scientists are concerned 2023 could see even starker climate extremes.
But there are hopeful signs too. The report found that renewable energy generated more electricity than fossil gas for the first time ever last year, with wind and solar accounting for 22.3% of the EU’s electricity, while fossil gas accounted for 20% and coal power for 16%.
“Increasing use of renewables and low-carbon energy sources is crucial to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement."
"Himalayan glaciers could lose up to 80% of their ice by 2100 as temperatures rise, report warns",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/asia/himalayan-glaciers-melt-climate-scn-intl-hnk,"Himalayan glaciers could lose up to 80% of their ice by 2100 as temperatures rise, report warns
The world’s highest peaks are at risk of losing up to 80% of their volume by the end of the century with profound consequences for millions of people under worst case climate scenarios, international scientists in Nepal warned in a new report.
The report, published Tuesday by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), examined the impact of climate change on an area stretching 1.6 million square miles (4.1 million square kilometers) from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east.
The report found that glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountain range region melted 65% faster in the 2010s compared with the previous decade, which suggests higher temperatures are already having an impact.
Ice and snow in the region feeds 12 rivers that provide freshwater to two billion people in 16 countries, including China, India and Pakistan, and eventually too much water will eventually lead to too little, the report warns.
The same group published a report in 2019, which found that even in the most optimistic case, where average global warming was limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the region would lose at least one third of its glaciers.
The group’s updated report shows those projections have since worsened.
With between 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the world’s highest mountain region stands to lose 30% to 50% of its volume by 2100, the latest report said.
If the world breaches 3 degrees Celsius of warming, glaciers in Nepal and Bhutan in the eastern Himalayas are at risk of losing 75% of their ice, and by just one degree more, that ticks up to 80%, according to the report.
The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year between 2023 and 2027 is predicted to be between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degree Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 average, according to the World Meteorological Organization
Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
“In all three pillars of climate action – in mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage – we are at a standstill or going the wrong way; while the consequences of inaction are accelerating by the day,” Prof. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh was quoted as saying in the report.
Rapid warming and glacial melt
About 240 million people live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, many of their cultures dating back thousands of years, and another the 1.65 billion live downstream.
Many high mountain communities depend on glacial waters to irrigate crops and to maintain their livestock, but the accelerated melting would inundate farmlands downstream followed by periods of drought as water sources dry up, the report said.
The erosion of glacial slopes also heightens the likelihood of floods, landslides and avalanches, increasing the risk to millions living in mountain communities.
“For them, this is home, and their livelihoods are mostly dependent on agriculture, livestock, tourism, and medicinal and aromatic plants,” report co-author Amina Maharjan, a senior specialist in livelihoods and migration at ICIMOD.
“What we realized in doing this assessment is that all of these are very, very sensitive to slight changes in climatic conditions and cryospheric conditions in the region,” she said.
For example, snowfall patterns are increasingly out of sync with seasonality, blanketing pastures and shrinking the grazing land for livestock, Maharjan explained. Over the past half decade, yaks have died due to a lack of food in India, Nepal and Bhutan, leaving farmers with huge income loses, she added.
The remoteness and rough terrain of the region also means that mountain communities often lack access to immediate disaster response.
“The glaciers of the Hindu Kush Himalaya are a major component of the Earth system. With two billion people in Asia reliant on the water that glaciers and snow here hold, the consequences of losing this cryosphere are too vast to contemplate. We need leaders to act now to prevent catastrophe,” said Izabella Koziell, deputy director general of the ICIMOD.
Unique species are also threatened by adverse changes to the climate of the diverse ecosystems that include tropical and subtropical rainforests, temperate coniferous forest and cold deserts, the report said.
Fourteen species of butterflies have already become extinct from the Murree Hills of Pakistan, according to the report, while endemic frog species are among the most impacted by climate change as they experience breeding problems and developmental deformities."
Biden touts his climate credentials in California,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/19/politics/joe-biden-california-climate-change/index.html,"Biden touts his climate credentials in California
President Joe Biden on Monday touted his administration’s record on climate change, which he called “the most aggressive climate action ever,” while hitting Republicans in Congress for trying to block it.
“What we’re seeing here is an amazing success story of how you can work together to make our communities more climate resilient – that matters, it matters, resiliency matters,” he said from the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center and Preserve in Palo Alto, California, after a tour.
“I’ve toured many sites across the country that clearly show climate change as a genuine existential – as the existential threat to humanity – the existential threat to humanity.”
Biden’s defense of his climate record comes less than one week after four major environmental groups endorsed his 2024 reelection for president in the first-ever joint endorsement from the LCV Action Fund, NextGen PAC, the Sierra Club, and the NRDC Action Fund.
Biden heavily courted climate and environmental justice groups during his last campaign and has made the climate crisis central to his governing agenda with new announcements over the last couple months on environmental justice initiatives and aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants.
However, some groups have expressed frustration over his administration’s approval of a major Alaska oil project earlier this year.
During his remarks Biden recounted previous trips to California during which he surveyed wildfire damage, noting that last year natural disasters caused $165 billion in damages across the country.
“But the worsening impacts are not inevitable – building on our incredible efforts locally, my administration is doing all we can to help recover and build, so we can be prepared to adapt,” he said, outlining a series of new steps specifically focused on climate resilience.
Among those steps are the $575 million “Climate Resilience Regional Challenge,” which will be launched by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The initiative will help coastal and Great Lakes communities “become more resilient to extreme weather and other impacts of the climate crisis,” according to a White House fact sheet.
Other moves include $2 billion in Department of Energy funding – including $67 million for California alone – to modernize the electrical grid and make it more climate resilient, and the first-ever White House Climate resilience summit.
The funding is provided through the Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s signature health care and climate legislation.
However, that law has been under siege by congressional Republicans who are trying to repeal some of its provisions.
“This is how we’re going to meet the moment – unfortunately, some of our MAGA Republican friends in Congress are continuing to try to undo all the progress we’ve already made in the first two and a half years,” Biden said.
“They were holding the country hostage over the debt limit unless I would gut the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act – I had determined not to let that happen … and in the end, we didn’t just protect some of the climate money and clean energy provisions, we protected every single solitary one.”"

President Joe Biden will highlight climate commitments made by his administration and announce new federal funding for climate resilience projects as part of a three-day trip to the Bay Area in Northern California that begins Monday, according to a White House official.
Biden’s trip builds on several campaign-related stops over the past week at which he outlined key planks for his reelection bid, including touting stricter gun safety measures at a summit in Connecticut and underscoring his economic pitch in Philadelphia.
It also comes less than a week after four major environmental groups backed Biden’s campaign for a second term in a first-ever joint endorsement from the LCV Action Fund, NextGen PAC, the Sierra Club and the NRDC Action Fund. In a speech in Washington after the endorsement, Biden called climate change “the only truly existential threat,” adding, “If we don’t meet the requirements that we’re looking at, we’re in real trouble.”
Biden heavily courted climate and environmental justice groups during his 2020 campaign and has made combating climate change central to his governing agenda with announcements over the past few months on environmental justice initiatives and aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants.
Some environmental groups and activists have expressed frustration over his administration’s approval of a major Alaska oil project earlier this year and more recently over the White House pushing for the Mountain Valley pipeline to be included in the debt ceiling package enacted earlier this month.
On Monday, Biden will tour coastal wetland areas and discuss actions his administration has taken to alleviate the climate crisis and protect the environment during a visit to the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center and Preserve in Palo Alto, California, according to the White House official.
As part of his remarks, which will be delivered alongside state, community and environmental justice leaders, the president will announce that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is launching a $575 million “Climate Resilience Regional Challenge,” which will help coastal and Great Lakes communities “become more resilient to extreme weather and other impacts of the climate crisis,” according to a White House fact sheet.
Biden issued an executive order prioritizing environmental justice in April, establishing the new Office of Environmental Justice within the White House Council on Environmental Quality. In a speech at the time ahead of Earth Day, Biden said that “environmental justice will be the mission of the entire government woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.”
The funding to be announced Monday, which is part of the president’s signature climate and health care law enacted last year, will support building natural infrastructure, protecting public access to coastal natural resources and other measures aimed at protecting communities for storm surge, flooding and rising sea levels, according to the White House.
Biden will also announce that he expects to host a White House Summit on Building Climate Resilient Communities later this year during which his administration will release a new National Climate Resilience Framework that will outline steps the federal government can take to promote climate resiliency, according to the fact sheet.

Four alarming charts that show just how extreme the climate is right now,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/17/world/four-climate-charts-extreme-weather-heat-oceans,"Four alarming charts that show just how extreme the climate is right now
Soaring temperatures. Unusually hot oceans. Record high levels of carbon pollution in the atmosphere and record low levels of Antarctic ice.
We’re only halfway through 2023 and so many climate records are being broken, some scientists are sounding the alarm, fearing it could be a sign of a planet warming much more rapidly than expected.
In a widely shared tweet, Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science, called rising ocean and air temperatures “totally bonkers.”
He added, “people who look at this stuff routinely can’t believe their eyes. Something very weird is happening.”
I know there are a million people sharing temperature anomaly charts and maps lately, but there's a good reason for that. This is totally bonkers and people who look at this stuff routinely can't believe their eyes. Something very weird is happening. pic.twitter.com/vZ9eKEs22b
Other scientists have said while the records are alarming, they are not unexpected due to both the continued rise of planet-heating pollution and the arrival of the natural climate phenomenon El Niño, which has a global heating effect.
Whether the broken records are a sign of climate change progressing beyond what climate the models predict, or are the outcome of the climate crisis unfolding as expected, they remain a very concerning signal of what’s to come, scientists said.
“These changes are deeply disturbing because of what they mean for people this coming summer, and every summer after, until we cut our carbon emissions at a much faster pace than we’re currently doing,” Jennifer Marlon, research scientist at Yale School of the Environment, told CNN.
The world is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in preindustrial times, and the next five years are predicted to be the hottest on record.
“We’ve been saying this for a long time – as polar scientists and as climate scientists – we’ve been saying you can count on the next few decades to consistently get warmer,” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told CNN. “We’re not going to turn back until we actually do something about this.”
Here are four charts showing just how record-breaking this year has already been, with the hottest months still to come.
Global temperatures spike
This year is shaping up to be one of the hottest yet, with global data showing temperatures spiking to unusually high levels.
The first eleven days of June saw the highest temperatures on record for this time of year by a substantial margin, according to an analysis released Thursday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. It is also the first time global air temperatures during June exceeded preindustrial levels by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the scientists found.
Heat records are being broken across the world.
In Canada, where an unusually stifling heat wave is blanketing much of the country, temperatures have broken multiple records. The heat has helped set the stage for “unprecedented,” early wildfires already burning an area about 15 times bigger than average for this time of the year and sending hazardous smoke into the United States.
Several all-time heat records were also broken earlier this month in Siberia, as temperatures shot up above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Parts of Central America, as well as Texas and Louisiana are also facing blistering temperatures. And Puerto Rico experienced extreme heat this June, with temperatures feeling like more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service.
Swaths of Southeast Asia have experienced their “harshest heat wave on record,” while record temperatures in China have killed animals and crops and sparked concerns about food security.
“The current situation is bizarre,” Phil Reid with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, told CNN. “The strangest El Niño ever. How are you supposed to define or declare an El Niño when everywhere is hot?”
Ocean heat heads off the charts
Oceans are heating up to record levels and show no sign of stopping. Rising ocean surface temperatures began alarming scientists in March when they started to climb and then skyrocketed to reach record levels in April, leaving scientists scrambling to figure out why.
Last month was the hottest May on record for the world’s oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s a pattern of warming that has been going on for years. In 2022, the world’s oceans broke heat records for the fourth year in a row.
Climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who closely tracks extreme temperatures around the globe, said he didn’t think the rapid warming would come so soon. “Even before El Niño was officially declared, the tropics and the oceans were already experiencing a very fast warming,” Herrera told CNN. “It was expected, yes,” he added. “But not as fast as it has been.”
Ocean warming poses dire consequences, including coral bleaching, the die-off of marine life and rising sea levels. And while El Niño usually ushers in a less active Atlantic hurricane season, high ocean temperatures help fuel them, potentially negating or outweighing El Niño’s dampening effect.
Antarctic sea ice at record lows
Antarctica’s sea ice is currently at record lows for this time of year, with some scientists concerned it is a further sign the climate crisis has arrived in this isolated region.
In late February, Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent since records began in the 1970s, at 691,000 square miles. It’s “not just ‘barely a record low,’” Scambos told CNN at the time. “It’s on a very steep downward trend.”
As the Antarctic has moved into its winter, and the sea ice has started to grow again, levels are still tracking at record low levels for this time of year.
The decline is “truly exceptional and alarming,” Scambos said, underscoring Antarctica’s sea ice extent is roughly 386,000 square miles – about twice the area of California – below where it should be for this time of the year.
“2023 is just heading off into crazy territory,” he said. Both Reid and Scambos said there is a link between this decline and the warm waters off the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Even a tenth of a degree of warming, they said, is enough to inhibit sea ice growth.
The decline in sea ice also poses severe harm to the continent’s species, including penguins who rely on sea ice for feeding and hatching eggs.
“Bottom line, the conditions the Antarctic system depends on to keep heat and ice and certain water types in their place are breaking down a little bit,” Scambos said. “It started with an unusual series of storms in 2016, but there’s been a persistent effect that is now leading to more heat being stirred up into the polar water layer, and that is stifling sea ice growth.”
Record carbon dioxide levels
The levels of carbon dioxide in the air, which is released from the burning of fossil fuels, hit a record in May, scientists from NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego reported early this month.
The record of 424 parts per million continues “a steady climb further into territory not seen for millions of years,” the scientists noted in a statement. Carbon pollution levels, which fuel the climate crisis, are now more than 50% higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution began, NOAA has said.
“Every year we see carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere increase as a direct result of human activity,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “Every year, we see the impacts of climate change in the heat waves, droughts, flooding, wildfires and storms happening all around us.”"

People often want to know if an extreme weather event happened because of climate change, said Friederike Otto, climate scientist and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative.
But it is not a simple question. “You can’t answer this with yes or no,” she told journalists at a briefing last week. It is because climate change alters the likelihood and intensity of extreme events, she said.
Otto and other scientists are using a scientific technique to transform our understanding of how this dynamic plays out. And, more often than not, they are finding the clear fingerprints of climate change on extreme weather events.
Called “attribution,” the method involves analyzing real world observations as well as climate models to establish whether a particular extreme event could have happened in a world without global heating.
While attribution studies are not done for every extreme weather event, they help bring home the realities of the direct and immediate damage the climate crisis is doing to people’s lives, which scientists say will only get worse if the world continues to pump out planet-warming pollution.
“We’re always going to have extreme weather, but if we keep driving in this direction, we’re gonna have a lot of extreme weather,” said Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder.
From intense heat and record-breaking drought, to severe storms fueled by hotter air and oceans, here are 10 disasters showing the devastating impacts of the human-caused climate crisis.
The “impossible” events
In some cases, the impacts of climate change are so clear and so overwhelming, scientists conclude extreme weather events would have been all but impossible without global warming. These six events fit the category:
Siberian heat wave, 2020
In 2020, a prolonged, unprecedented heat wave seared one of the coldest places on Earth, triggering widespread wildfires. Temperatures in the small Siberian town of Verkhoyansk hit 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), the warmest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic.
The punishing heat, which spanned from January to June and pushed temperatures 5 degrees Celsius above average, would have been “almost impossible” in a climate not warmed by carbon pollution, according to rapid attribution study by the attribution initiative.
The heat wave was made at least 600 times more likely by the climate crisis, the scientists concluded, finding such prolonged Arctic heat would happen less than once every 80,000 years without human-induced climate change.
Andrew Ciavarella, lead author of the research and senior detection and attribution scientist at the UK’s Met Office, called the findings “truly staggering.”
Pacific Northwest heat wave, 2021
The end of June 2021 was unforgettable for parts of the Pacific Northwest. A historic heat wave killed hundreds, triggered devastating fires and worsened an already unrelenting drought in parts of the region.
Oregon, Washington, and western provinces of Canada including British Columbia, saw record-shattering temperatures, which reached as high as 121.3 degrees Fahrenheit (49.6 Celsius) in the Canadian village of Lytton, which subsequently was burned down by a wildfire.
According to an analysis by more than two dozen scientists at the attribution initiative, the June heat wave “would have been virtually impossible” without the influence of human-caused climate change.
“Our results provide a strong warning: Our rapidly warming climate is bringing us into uncharted territory that has significant consequences for health, well-being, and livelihoods,” the authors wrote.
Northern Hemisphere drought, 2022
From North America to Europe to China, vast swaths of the Northern Hemisphere experienced extreme drought in the summer of 2022, straining water resources, ruining crops, and priming the landscape for perilous wildfires.
Attribution initiative scientists concluded climate change made these drought conditions at least 20 times more likely. The soaring temperatures would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, the analysis also found.
The Western US saw shrunken water levels, worsening drought, and fallowed farmland. And China and Europe saw thousands of heat-related deaths. The heat and drought in Europe claimed least at 15,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
“The 2022 Northern Hemisphere summer is a good example of how extreme events caused by climate change can also unfold over large regions in longer periods of time,” Otto said.
Horn of Africa drought, 2020-2023
A three-year drought in the Horn of Africa, one of the world’s most impoverished regions, has caused crops to wither, water to disappear, and livestock to starve in large parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.
The drought, which is the worst in 40 years, has had a catastrophic human impact, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving more than 20 million facing acute food insecurity.
It would not have happened without climate change, which made it at least 100 times more likely, according to a rapid attribution analysis.
“Almost half of the country’s population is affected, over 3 million people are displaced,” Mamunur Rahman Malik, the Somalia representative for the World Health Organization, told CNN in April. “The country continues to pay the price of global warming and climate change,” he added.
Mediterranean heat, 2023
In April, a blistering heat wave with temperatures far more typical of late summer swept Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Algeria, exacerbating a severe drought that had already left crops dry and drained critical water resources.
Human-caused global heating made the western Mediterranean heat wave at least 100 times more likely. Scientists said the heat, which exceeded 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit (40.6 Celsius) in parts of Morocco, would have been “almost impossible without climate change.”
Before the Earth warmed, such an intense event would be expected only once in 40,000 years, the scientists found.
Extreme heat in South Asia, 2023
Large parts of South Asia faced a brutal heat wave in April. Countries including Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, India and Bangladesh all saw new all-time temperature records.
In Thailand, temperatures topped 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 Celsius) for the first time ever, but humidity meant temperatures felt much higher.
In Thailand and Laos, the humid heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” without the climate crisis, according to attribution initiative scientists. While the heat in India and Bangladesh was made at least 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change, the same analysis found.
… and the ones made much more likely or more severe by climate change
For other extreme weather events, the effect of the human-caused climate crisis is to make them more likely or more severe:
Australia Black Summer fires, 2019-2020
Australia experienced months of blood-red skies and thick gray smoke in the summer of 2019 to 2020, as devastating wildfires swept many parts of the country. Stark images emerged of firefighters rescuing koalas and people pouring water on the burned hands of kangaroos.
The fires, which tore through around 50 million acres, were linked to more than 400 deaths, with thousands admitted to the hospital due to wildfire smoke-related conditions. Nearly three billion animals were either killed or displaced by the bush fires.
Human-caused climate change made the conditions leading to the severe fires at least 30% more likely, a World Weather Attribution analysis found.
Western US drought, 2020-2023
The Western United States has faced its worst drought in centuries over the past few years, fueling devastating wildfires and triggering water shortages.
In California, the summer of 2021 saw the most extreme drought on record for the state. A hydroelectric power plant at Lake Oroville, the state’s second-largest reservoir, was forced to shut down due to low water levels for the first time since it opened in 1967.
Meanwhile, two of the country’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, dropped so low, government officials imposed unprecedented water cuts for the states of Nevada and Arizona, as well as in Mexico.
A study from the journal Nature Climate Change found the period from 2000 to 2021 was the driest the West has ever been in 1,200 years, noting human-caused climate change made the megadrought 72% worse.
Hurricane Ian, 2022
When Hurricane Ian swept across the Caribbean and into Florida in 2022, it left a trail of destruction in its wake, killing more than 100 people and caused roughly $65 billion of damage.
Extreme rainfall caused huge amounts of damage and scientists say it was made more intense by global heating.
The hurricane was at least 10% wetter because of climate change, according to an analysis by scientists at Stony Brook University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Pakistan floods, 2022
Major flooding caused by record monsoon rains claimed the lives of nearly 1,500 people during the summer of 2022, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages.
The floods left a third of Pakistan underwater. The country received more than three times its usual rainfall in August, making it the wettest August since 1961. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Pakistani people were facing “a monsoon on steroids.”
Climate change made the rainfall in the hard-hit provinces of Sindh and Balochistan 50% more intense than it would have been had the climate not warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius, an attribution initiative study found."
"The planet’s coldest, saltiest ocean waters are heating up and shrinking, report finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/world/antarctic-deep-ocean-water-shrinking-climate-scn-intl/index.html,"The planet’s coldest, saltiest ocean waters are heating up and shrinking, report finds
Deep ocean water in the Antarctic is heating up and shrinking, with potentially far-reaching consequences for climate change and deep ocean ecosystems, according to a report.
“Antarctic bottom water” is the coldest, saltiest water on the planet. These waters play a crucial role in the ocean’s ability to act as a buffer against climate change by absorbing excess heat and human-caused carbon pollution. They also circulate nutrients across the ocean.
But in the Weddell Sea, located east of the Antarctic Peninsula, this vital water mass is in decline, due to long-term changes in winds and sea ice, according to the study published Monday by the British Antarctic Survey.
Scientists used decades of data taken by ships as well as from satellites to assess the volume, temperature and saltiness of this slice of deep Antarctic Ocean.
“Some of these sections were first visited as far back as 1989, making them some of the most comprehensively sampled regions in the Weddell Sea,” Povl Abrahamsen, a physical oceanographer at BAS and co-author, said in a statement.
They found that the volume of the cold bottom waters has shrunk by more than 20% over the past three decades. They also found that ocean waters deeper than 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) have warmed four times faster than the rest of the global ocean.
“We used to think that changes in the deep ocean could only occur over centuries. But these key observations from the Weddell Sea show that changes in the dark abyss can take place over just a few decades,” Alessandro Silvano from the University of Southampton in the UK, a co-author of the study, said in a statement.
The reason these deep waters are shrinking is down to changes in sea ice formation caused by weakening winds, the study found. Stronger winds tend to push ice away from the ice shelf, which leaves areas of water open for more ice to form. Weaker winds have meant these gaps are smaller, slowing sea ice creation, according to the study.
New sea ice is vital to create the Weddell Sea’s very cold, salty water. As the water freezes, it pushes out salt and as salty water is denser, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.
The changes in these deep waters can have far-reaching consequences. They are a vital part of global ocean circulation, transporting human-caused carbon pollution into the deep ocean where it remains for centuries, said Silvano. If this deep circulation weakens, “less carbon can be absorbed by the deep ocean, limiting the ability of the ocean to mitigate global warming,” Silvano told CNN.
Oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the world’s excess heat since the 1970s and absorb almost a third of human-produced carbon pollution.
This cold, dense water also has a vital role in supplying oxygen to deep ocean waters. How and whether deep ecosystems could adapt to less oxygen “is unclear,” added Silvano.
Holly Ayres, a researcher at the department of meteorology at Reading University in the UK who was not involved in the study, said the BAS research is a step forward in our knowledge about  deep ocean water in the Antarctic.
“To have combined decades of ship-based observations and satellite data is a big leap in our understanding of the formation process, and may be helpful in our understanding of how Antarctic bottom water will form in the future,” Ayres told CNN.
While the changes the study identified are the result of natural climate variability, climate change is also having an impact on Antarctica’s deep waters.
In a March study, scientists found that melting ice is diluting the saltiness of the ocean and slowing down the the circulation of deep ocean water in the Antarctic. Failure to limit planet-heating pollution could lead to the collapse of the circulation of deep ocean water, with potentially devastating consequences for the climate and marine life, the report found.
BAS new study is “an early warning” Shenjie Zhou, an oceanographer at BAS and lead author of the study, told CNN. “The ongoing changes in the deep water layer in the Antarctic are already happening and it’s not heading in the direction that we want.”"
Opinion: How I talk to my kids about climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/opinions/east-cost-smog-climate-change-action-education-schifter/index.html,"Opinion: How I talk to my kids about climate change
Editor’s Note: Laura Schifter is a senior fellow with the Aspen Institute and leads This Is Planet Ed, the institute’s initiative on climate change information. She is also a lecturer at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. She lives in Arlington, Virginia. The views expressed in this essay are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.
End-of-year performances, class parties, teacher gifts, camp schedules, last day of school pictures: for parents across the country, the to-do lists right now are long, and they come with a mixture of emotions.
There’s gratitude for another school year completed, but sadness in seeing your child getting yet another year older and closer to that dreaded moment when they will be moving away from home. There’s also excitement for the lazy days of summer, hearing the jingle of the ice cream truck or playing in the splash zone at the park.
This year, those feelings are further clouded by the smoggy haze that shrouded much of the Northeast this week and threw many end-of-year celebrations into flux.
On Wednesday, as usual, my second grader asked Alexa for the weather. Alexa replied, “By the way, there’s an air quality alert in effect.” I didn’t need Alexa to inform me of this; stepping outside in Washington, DC, the smoke was visible in the air, coming all the way from wildfires in Canada. I wondered if it was safe for my three children to breathe.
Over the past few days – and indeed over the past few years – I’ve noticed two new emotions have crept in: dread and guilt.
My community is sizzling to a crisp
I feel dread knowing that the next few months will be marked by moments of extreme weather — around the country and the world — that will likely be unprecedented. This extreme weather, which will only get worse each year, will surely become a normal part of how children experience summer.
Will it be another heat dome over the Pacific Northwest? Flooding in Kentucky? Fires in California? Something in Europe or Pakistan? This summer, will extreme weather hit closer to home? We won’t know for sure what it will be or where, but we can predict that these extreme weather events are becoming more common.
I got an email from my kids’ school this past week: “Weather Notice: Code Red Air Quality.” All outdoor activities and play were canceled.
In April, the Environmental Protection Agency released a report highlighting the health impacts of climate change on children and youth: Increasing rates of asthma, worse allergies, lost learning and more risk of displacement. Poor air quality, in particular, affects child brain development and mental health.
My guilt sets in. This is the reality of our children’s lives, and we, collectively as adult humans, are responsible. Our greenhouse gas emissions — largely from burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, manufacturing, buildings and the clearing of land for agriculture — are changing our atmosphere.
Opinion: A Californian’s message to East Coasters struggling in smoke-filled air
Our atmosphere acts like a heat-trapping blanket, which has created the perfect conditions for a stable environment in which humans can thrive. But we have been changing the material of that blanket from a quilt to a heavy comforter, trapping more heat and destabilizing our climate. These moments of extreme weather will become more typical, more intense and more destructive.
I grew up with an underlying assumption of what summer might entail. My children will grow up needing to process and adapt to the reality that summer might bring with it dangerous weather and the inability to play, carefree, outside.
So, what can we do? As a society, we have a responsibility to prepare our children for climate instability. And we must do our part now to reduce our emissions and adapt.
This can start at home and in our communities.
Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist suggests one of the most important things we can do about climate change: talk about it. This includes conversations with our kids.
When I picked up my daughter from preschool on Wednesday, she said, “Mommy, we didn’t have recess because of wildfires! Is it because of our Earth blanket?”
Yes. We talk about what we can do to adapt: stay inside for recess and reschedule the school’s field day. She said she noticed her teacher wearing a mask.
My second grader added, “And we can get power from the sun, compost and walk instead of drive!” We haven’t thought about this as a singular “climate change talk,” but rather as part of how we talk — how we try to help them make sense of the world. We make it a mission to always be connected to solutions.
We can also show kids that we are working to address the problem through our actions. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provide unprecedented opportunities to advance solutions in our homes, schools and communities. The nonprofit Rewiring America created an IRA Savings Calculator, which explains how much you can save in your home with the tax credits available. A family of four in Arlington, Virginia, making $125,000 per year can save up to $7,500 off an electric vehicle, up to $2,000 for a heat pump air conditioner and 30% off rooftop solar installation, to name a few.
While not all parents can make changes in their home, most could advocate for change at their kids’ schools. The organization I lead, This Is Planet Ed at the Aspen Institute, in partnership with National Parent Teacher Association and Mothers Out Front, created an advocacy toolkit to help. Schools can get up to $40,000 off an electric school bus and potentially up to 50% off the cost of adding solar.
Driving home, my fourth grader sang a Taylor Swift song. The line “Or it’s gonna go down in flames” hit me and my stomach dropped.
The only way to prevent the dread and guilt from taking over is by taking action. For all our kids, it’s time we prioritize their future and help ensure they can thrive in a changing climate."
This country’s love affair with air conditioning shows a Catch 22 of climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/asia/air-conditioning-singapore-climate-change-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"This country’s love affair with air conditioning shows a Catch 22 of climate change
When the temperature soared to 99 degrees Fahrenheit last month, Singapore resident Chee Kuan Chew saw just one option: cancel all plans and stay indoors in air-conditioned comfort.
“You can’t survive without air con in Singapore,” Chee said. “It’s impossible with the heat.”
The 20-year-old university student lives with his family in a four-bedroom flat in Ang Mo Kio, a bustling district that made headlines in the Southeast Asian city state when its temperatures hit a 40-year high in a recent heat wave. Thankfully, Chee said, his home has five air conditioners – one in each bedroom and a larger unit in the living room.
“I drank plenty of water, took cold showers and kept the air conditioning on for the entire weekend. That’s my way of managing the heat,” Chee said.
Taking solace in air conditioning in Singapore is hardly unreasonable behavior. Situated roughly 85 miles north of the equator, the island nation is famously hot and humid, with temperatures that stretch into the 80s year-round – a climate that has helped make it one of the most air-conditioned countries in the world, with more units per capita than any of its Southeast Asian neighbors.
Indeed, in this city, air conditioning has become almost a way of life. An office or mall without it is near unthinkable; 99% of private condominiums are air conditioned, as are the majority of public housing apartments.
Lee Kuan Yew, the country’s founding prime minister, once called air conditioning “the greatest invention of the 20th century” and credited it for helping to transform the island from a backwater British colony into one of the world’s pre-eminent financial centers (one that today also enjoys some of the world’s highest per capita wages).
But Singapore’s love affair with air conditioning has an enormous cost.
It has trapped a nation already hot – and getting hotter – in what experts describe as a “dangerous, vicious cycle.” It’s a climate change Catch 22 paradox that faces all nations which rely on air conditioning to make life just that little bit more tolerable.
Put simply: the warmer the world gets, the more people turn to their air conditioners. And the more they turn to their air conditioners, the warmer the world gets.
Global warming paradox
Compared to gas guzzling cars and flatulent cows, air conditioners often fly under the radar when it comes to most media coverage of global warming culprits. But the machines are a potent force in accelerating climate change.
The World Economic Forum (WEF) has estimated that – if not reined in – air conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for up to a 0.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures by the end of the century.
Their effect on global warming is two-fold. Firstly, like refrigerators, many air conditioners today use a class of coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are harmful greenhouse gases.
Secondly, and perhaps ultimately even more problematically, air conditioners tend to use large amounts of electricity, generated by the burning of fossil fuels.
According to the International Energy Agency, air conditioners and electric fans account for about 10% of all global electricity consumption.
As a relatively compact nation, Singapore – with a population of about 5.4 million and an area a little smaller than New York City – contributes just a fraction of the HFCs and electricity demand that help drive global warming.
Even with its high per capita usage, its total emissions are dwarfed by those of Japan and the United States, for example, where about 90% of households use air conditioning according to the WEF.
Still, that doesn’t mean Singapore won’t suffer the consequences of a warming world just as much. And as an already hot nation that is heating up fast, it has less leeway than some others before temperatures become simply intolerable.
According to government data released in 2019, the city state has been heating up twice as fast as the rest of the globe over the past six decades. Maximum daily temperatures could also reach highs of 37 degrees Celsius by 2100, officials warned.
The heat island effect
But rising temperatures in Singapore are not just about global warming.
They are also caused by the Urban Heat Island effect, in which highly urbanized areas experience higher temperatures than their surrounding locales.
The effect is caused by urban structures such as buildings, roads and vehicles trapping and releasing heat into the environment, especially at night, and is particularly pronounced in highly developed and relatively densely packed places like Singapore.
It is made worse by the waste heat generated in cities by vehicles, factories and air conditioners, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Matthias Roth, a professor at the National University of Singapore who specializes in the subject, said that Singapore’s recent temperature rise was largely the result of a combination of background global warming and the Urban Heat Island effect.
While he cautioned it was difficult to quantify the exact contribution of heat emissions from air conditioning on the Urban Heat Island effect, he said that “in selected commercial areas with much human activity and traffic, as well as tall, multi-story buildings closely spaced together and using air conditioning… this local warming can perhaps contribute 1 to 2 degrees Celsius to the environment.”
While Roth noted these areas were “generally small and low in numbers and therefore would not significantly affect the average air temperature across the entire city,” he also pointed out that air conditioners are “not very energy efficient and when used in large numbers and often on a continuous basis, they can make up a large part of the energy consumption in hot places.”
In some ways, how much of the temperature rise is caused by global warming and how much by the Urban Heat Island effect is a moot point, as either way the result is the same: people feel hotter.
And the hotter people get, the more they use their air conditioning.
Breaking the loop
Still, experts say there are ways to break the air conditioning doom-loop.
Under the United Nations’ Kigali Amendment, agreed in 2016, many countries are phasing out HFCs – those harmful coolants used in many air conditioners – and replacing them with more climate friendly options, such as hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs.
Similar moves have worked in the past. The Kigali Amendment is an update to the Montreal Protocol that helped to phase out ozone-destroying Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in the 1980s.
Experts say there are also ways to cut down on the second problem with air conditioners – how much energy they use – by using other methods to keep cool.
Abundant green spaces, shading, water bodies and clever ventilation are among the more sustainable “passive cooling strategies” suggested by Radhika Khosla, associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment.
“While there are many instances when air conditioning is necessary, given the combination of hot temperatures and high humidity, what’s important is to always consider non-air con options first instead of making air conditioning the go-to solution for providing relief from extreme heat,” Khosla said.
“Singapore, with its experience of living with high heat and humidity, must set an example for other countries in identifying, promoting and scaling sustainable cooling solutions,” she added.
A breath of fresh air conditioning
Fittingly, the same place that once heralded air conditioning as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century is also at the forefront of efforts to make it fit for purpose in the 21st.
Singapore’s National Environment Agency (NEA) has banned the supply of high-GWP (global warming potential) refrigerants since October 2022 and says it encourages households to use fans rather than air conditioning where possible. The government agency has also advised residents to set timers and temperatures to no lower than 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and service units regularly to maintain efficiency, it told CNN.
Taking environmental concerns into account, one local university built what it says is the country’s “first net-zero energy building” – boasting naturally ventilated open spaces and an innovative “hybrid cooling system supplying 100 per cent fresh pre-cooled air.”
Operational since 2019, the six-story SDE 4 building at the National University of Singapore’s School of Design and Environment campus is testament to how thermal comfort “did not have to come at the expense of the environment,” its architects told CNN. “We worked hard to ensure that it would be a net-zero building,” deputy dean Heng Chye Kiang said.
Here, ceiling fans are used as alternatives to AC units. Smart senors measure and manage variables from temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide to air particles, light and sound to “further drive down energy consumption.”
“We hope it will inspire other buildings and designers to achieve the same and reduce energy usage in the fight against climate change,” the school said.
Heng added that after some years of operation, the building had turned out to be “energy positive” – producing more energy than it consumes – “by a large margin.”
In other words, amid a troubling paradox, there’s some positive energy, too."

The world’s biggest companies have made almost no progress on limiting global warming since 2018
The vast majority of the world’s biggest companies have done almost nothing in the past five years to cut their planet-heating pollution enough to avoid catastrophic climate change.
Large companies are either more likely to contribute to extreme levels of warming or are not disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions at all, according to a new report from ESG Book, seen by CNN.
The leading sustainability data provider found that the efforts of just 22% of the world’s 500 biggest public companies by market value are aligned with the Paris Agreement, aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That’s a measly gain from 18% of firms in 2018.
Climate scientists consider a 1.5 degree rise in the average global temperature a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
Almost half, or 45%, of companies are aligned with warming of at least 2.7 degrees Celsius — a disastrous level of warming that could expose billions of people to dangerously hot conditions. That’s down from 61% in 2018.
“Our data presents a clear message: we need to do more, and we need to do it quickly,” ESG Book CEO Daniel Klier said.
“Without a fundamental change in the way the global economy operates, it’s not obvious how we see a significant shift.”
The report is the latest in a string of evidence that the world is way off track to reach its climate goals. At the same time, major polluters such as Shell and BP
            
                (BP) are shifting their focus back to fossil fuel production following a year of bumper profits helped by soaring oil and gas prices.
Slow progress
In its analysis, ESG Book assigned “temperature scores” to companies based on publicly reported emission data and factors such as emission reduction targets to determine firms’ contribution to global climate goals.
The analysis covered companies with a market value of at least $10 billion in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, India and the European Union.
It accounted for direct emissions from operations as well as indirect emissions from use of the companies’ products. This is particularly important for oil and gas firms as most of their emissions are generated from the burning of their products such as gasoline and jet fuel.
In the UK, India and the EU, the number of companies with emission reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement has barely budged since 2018.
Progress in the United States and China has been better, although off a lower base.
In the United States, 20% of companies are Paris-aligned, up from 11% in 2018. In China, 12% are Paris-aligned, compared with just 3% five years ago.
“The encouraging thing is we know what levers to pull, and a lot of these companies are now much more active. But as the data shows, we’re not necessarily all moving at the right pace,” Klier told CNN.
In his view, a combination of more stringent government policies, changes to consumer behavior and technological breakthroughs will be required to bring about a meaningful shift in the current climate trajectory.
Institutional investors, such as pension funds, also have an important role to play in directing more capital toward renewable technologies, he said.
There are signs this money flow is gathering pace. According to the International Energy Agency, investment in solar power is set to overtake investment in oil production for the first time this year.
“For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about $1.7 are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a report last month.
Still, slightly more than $1 trillion is expected to flow toward oil, gas and coal this year, significantly above the level consistent with the world reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the IEA said.
There is now a 66% chance the planet’s temperature will rise above the 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming for at least one year in the next five years, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report in May. While that would only be a temporary breach, it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating, leading to a rapid rise in sea levels, more extreme weather and the demise of vital ecosystems, the group said.

The war in Ukraine has brought an enormous human toll: Thousands of civilians have been killed, millions have been forced to flee overseas, it has destroyed homes, schools and hospitals.  But beyond the immediate, visceral impacts, the conflict is also causing a climate disaster at a time when the world is already struggling to meet climate goals, according to a new report.
A team of carbon accounting experts has evaluated the climate impact of the first year of the conflict, which started in February 2022.
They found that a total of 120 million metric tons of planet-heating pollution can be attributed to the first 12 months of the war, according to the report published Wednesday. That’s equivalent to the annual emissions of Belgium, or those produced by nearly 27 million gas-powered cars on the road for a year.
“It’s the first time that the emissions of a war have been mapped on such a comprehensive scale,” Lennard de Klerk, the report’s lead author and an expert in war-related emissions, told CNN.
The report, titled Climate Damage Caused by Russia’s War in Ukraine, follows on from a first interim assessment presented at the UN COP27 climate conference in November 2022.
Data was drawn from a wide range of sources, including satellites, scientific papers, expert interviews, industry reports and open-source intelligence.
The team of researchers looked at the climate impact of the planet-heating pollution produced directly from warfare, including fuel use for tanks, planes and other equipment, construction of fortifications and production of weapons. They also examined impacts from the consequences of the war, such as fires, destruction – and required reconstruction – of infrastructure and changes to the European energy mix.
Nearly 22 million metric tons of planet-heating pollution came from warfare, almost 20% of the total emissions attributable to the conflict, the report found.
But this may be a conservative estimate. The emissions of the military were challenging to calculate, de Klerk told CNN. It’s not possible, for example, to just get in touch with Russia to ask them how much fuel they are using in their tanks and planes, he said.
“We probably will only be able to really get a more accurate estimate once the war is over,” de Klerk said.
Others were easier to calculate, especially the amount of planet-warming pollution from fires caused by shelling, bombing and explosions. Using remote monitoring tools based on satellite data, the researchers concluded that these fires produced nearly 18 million metric tons, accounting for 15% of the total war emissions
The number of fires burning over an area larger than one hectare (2.5 acres) increased 36-fold in the first year of the war compared to the 12 months before it started, according to the report. While the winter months saw fire activity dip, it is expected to pick up again as summer approaches, de Klerk said.
The biggest climate impact, however, accounting for almost half the pollution from the war, will come from the post-war reconstruction of damaged and destroyed buildings and infrastructure, the report found.
Rebuilding will require vast amounts of materials such as cement and concrete, which produce very high levels of carbon pollution.
Over the course of the conflict, increasing Russian attacks on and destruction of energy infrastructure has pushed up the planet-heating pollution estimated to be produced during reconstruction, the report found.
“The biggest chunk of the emissions are still in the future reconstruction of Ukraine,” de Klerk said.
The report also looked at impacts outside of Ukraine, including the methane pollution released after the sabotage of the Russian gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 in September 2022. “We had an enormous release of methane emissions… that was really a surprise,” de Klerk said.
Changes to Europe’s energy mix were also analyzed but found a mixed outcome.
Very high prices for gas and oil following Russia’s invasion caused Europe to make some decisions, including burning more coal, which increased levels of planet-heating pollution. But the conflict also helped usher in a faster transition to renewables, as countries looked to lessen their dependence on Russian oil and gas.
The report authors even calculated the extra planet-warming pollution created by airlines rerouting flights to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
“If you look at the environmental costs of what’s happening in Ukraine, that war is a catastrophe when it comes to carbon emissions,” James Appathurai, NATO’s deputy assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, told Reuters.
As the war continues to unfold in Ukraine, “the human catastrophe and the damage that’s being done to the country is overwhelming,” de Klerk said. Climate considerations will not be what’s occupying Ukrainians at the moment, he acknowledged, adding: “It’s a matter of survival.”
But it is still important to analyze and document the often overlooked, longer-term climate impacts of the conflict, he said.
“We want to show the world that the damage that Russia is doing with these acts of aggression is not only within Ukraine, but impacts the whole world through the additional emissions of greenhouse gases, which is everyone’s problem,” he said.
Global commitments to keep warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels are already slipping out of reach.
Rachel Kyte, dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University, who was not involved in the research, said the report highlighted the crucial impact of war on the world’s ability to tackle climate change
“The report raises important questions about including warfare in countries’ climate reporting and their transitions to net-zero and to greater resilience,” she told CNN. “For the whole of Europe, and the world, Ukraine’s reconstruction, following a just peace, must be green.”
The war in Ukraine has shown the importance of understanding the climate impact of warfare, de Klerk said, adding: “It’s something that we simply cannot continue to ignore.”"
A ‘once-in-200 years’ heat wave caught Southeast Asia off guard. Climate change will make them more common,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/asia/southeast-asia-heat-wave-humidity-climate-intl-hnk-dst-scn-dg/index.html,"A ‘once-in-200 years’ heat wave caught Southeast Asia off guard. Climate change will make them more common
Every day, countless mopeds criss-cross the congested city of Hanoi, in Vietnam, with commuters traveling to work or motorbike taxis dropping off everything from parcels to cooked food and clients.
One of them is Phong, 42, who starts his shift at 5 a.m. to beat the rush hour, navigating the dense swarm of mopeds and drives for over 12 hours a day with little rest.
But an unprecedented heat wave that engulfed his country in the past two months has made Phong’s job even more arduous. To get through the heat of the day, he equipped himself with a hat, wet handkerchiefs and several bottles of water – precautions that provided little relief as recorded daytime temperatures soared to more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
The average May temperature in Hanoi is 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit).
“If I get a heatstroke, I would be forced to suspend driving to recover,” he told CNN. “But I cannot afford it.”
Phong, who declined to give his surname, said he carries a tiny umbrella to protect his phone, the main tool he uses for work as a driver for the ride-hailing platform Grab, along with his bike. If the phone breaks, he misses out on much-needed income. “I was worried that the battery would overheat once exposed to the sun,” he said.
Nearby in the same city, sanitation worker Dinh Van Hung, 53, toils all day cleaning garbage from the bustling streets of Hanoi’s central Dong Da district.
“It is impossible to avoid the heat, especially at noon and early afternoon,” Dinh told CNN. “Extreme temperatures also make the garbage smell more unpleasant, the hard work is now even more difficult, directly affecting my health and labor.”
Dinh says “there is no other way” but to change when he starts and finishes his shift.
“I try to work early in the morning or afternoon and evening,” he said. “During lunch break when the temperature is too high, I find a sidewalk in a small alley, spread out the cardboard sheets to rest for a while and then resume work in the afternoon.”
Phong and Dinh are among millions of drivers, street vendors, cleaners, builders, farmers, and other outdoor or informal economy workers across Southeast Asia who were hit the hardest during what experts called the region’s “harshest heat wave on record.”
Workers like them make up the backbone of many societies but are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, with dangerously high temperatures greatly impacting their health and the already precarious nature of their professions.
April and May are typically the hottest months of the year in Southeast Asia, as temperatures rise before monsoon rains bring some relief. But this year, they reached levels never experienced before in most countries of the region, including tourism hotspots Thailand and Vietnam.
Thailand saw its hottest day in history at 45.4 degrees Celsius (114 degrees Fahrenheit) on April 15, while neighboring Laos topped out at 43.5 degrees Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit) for two consecutive days in May, and Vietnam’s all-time record was broken in early May with 44.2 degrees Celsius (112 degrees Fahrenheit), according to analysis of weather stations data by a climatologist and weather historian Maximiliano Herrera.
Herrera described it as “the most brutal never-ending heat wave” that has continued into June. On June 1, Vietnam broke the record for its hottest June day in history with 43.8 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) – with 29 days of the month to go.
In a recent report from the World Weather Attribution (WWA), an international coalition of scientists said the April heat wave in Southeast Asia was a once-in-200-years event that would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change.
The scorching heat in Southeast Asia was made even more unbearable and dangerous due to high humidity – a deadly combination.
Humid heat causes extreme distress and climate change can make it worse
Humidity, on top of extreme temperatures, makes it even harder for your body to try and cool itself down.
Heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion, have severe symptoms and can be life-threatening, especially for those with heart disease and kidney problems, diabetes, and pregnant people.
“When the surrounding humidity is very high, the body will continue to sweat trying to release moisture to cool itself, but because the sweat is not evaporating it will eventually lead to severe dehydration, and in acute cases it can lead to heat strokes and deaths,” said Mariam Zachariah, research associate in near-real time attribution of extreme events to climate change at World Weather Attribution initiative at Imperial College London.
“Which is why a humid heat wave is more dangerous than a dry heat wave,” she told CNN.
To understand the health risks of humid heat, scientists often calculate the “feels-like” temperature – a single measure of how hot it feels to the human body when air temperature and humidity are both taken into account, sometimes alongside other factors such as wind chill.
Perceived heat is usually several degrees higher than observed temperature and gives a more accurate reading of how heat affects people.
CNN analysis of Copernicus Climate Change Service data found that between early April and late May, all six countries in the continental portion of Southeast Asia had reached perceived temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) or more every single day. This is above a threshold considered dangerous, especially for people with health problems or those not used to extreme heat.
In Thailand, 20 days in April and at least 10 days in May reached feels-like temperatures above 46 degrees Celsius (115 degrees Fahrenheit). At this level, thermal heat stress becomes “extreme” and is considered life threatening for anybody including healthy people used to extreme humid heat.
Throughout April and May, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Malaysia all had several days with potential to cause extreme heat stress. Myanmar had 12 such days – until Cyclone Mocha brought relative relief, but severe devastation, when it made landfall on May 14.
The April-May heat wave in Southeast Asia caused widespread hospitalizations, damaged roads, sparked fires and led to school closures, however the number of deaths remains unknown, according to the World Weather Attribution report.
The study found that, because of climate change, the heat was more than two degrees hotter in perceived temperature than it could have been without global warming caused by pollution.
“When the atmosphere becomes warmer, its ability to hold the moisture becomes higher and therefore the chances of humid heat waves also increase,” Zachariah, one of the authors, told CNN.
If global warming continues to increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), such humid heat waves could occur ten times more often, according to the study.
And if emissions continue to increase at the same pace, the next two decades could already see 30 more deaths per million from heat in Thailand, and 130 more deaths per million by the end of the century, according to the UN’s Human Climate Horizons projections.
For Myanmar that number would be 30 and 520 more deaths per million respectively, for Cambodia – 40 and 270, data shows.
Extreme temperatures hit the poor and vulnerable the most
Extreme weather events also expose systemic inequalities.
“Occupation, age, health conditions and disabilities, access to health care services, socioeconomic status, even gender – these are all factors that can make people more or less vulnerable to heat waves,” said Chaya Vaddhanaphuti, one of the WWA report’s authors and lecturer at the department of geography at Chiang Mai University in Thailand.
Marginalized members of society, those without adequate access to healthcare and cooling systems, and those in jobs that are exposed to extremely hot and humid conditions are most at risk of heat stress.
“It’s important to talk about who can adapt, who can cope, and who has the resources to be able to do this,” Emmanuel Raju, also an author and director of the Copenhagen Center for Disaster Research, said in a press conference on May 17.
“For those working in the informal economy a lost day means a day lost in wages,” Raju said.
More than 60% of the employed population in Southeast Asia work in informal employment, and over 80% in Cambodia and Myanmar, according to a 2018 International Labour Organization (ILO) report.
In late April, Thai health authorities issued an extreme heat alert for the capital Bangkok and several other places across the country, warning people to stay indoors and of heat stroke dangers.
But for migrant workers like Supot Klongsap, nicknamed “Nui,” who temporarily left his home to work in construction in Bangkok during the pre-monsoon season, staying indoors was simply not an option.
He said that this year’s hot season was exceptional, causing him to sweat all the time and feel exhausted. “I started to sweat from 8 a.m., and it was difficult to work. I felt very exhausted from losing so much water.”
Nui, who slept at the construction site, said even the nights were unbearable. “Water coming from the pipe even during nighttime remained very hot just like it was boiled. It was difficult to find comfort.”
He said the accommodation for construction workers is roofed and walled with corrugated sheets, and it barely protects from heat. Any access to air-conditioned rooms is a luxury Nui couldn’t afford. “We had to rely on buying ice and adding it to our drinks, our simple way to cool down,” he said.
A 2021 study found that outdoor workers in developing countries have higher core body temperature than to those working indoors, and they are two to three times more at risk of dehydration, leading to a higher chance of reduced kidney function and other related conditions.
In Thailand, the government recommends reactive measures, such as staying indoors, hydrating adequately, wearing light-colored clothes, and avoiding certain foods, Chaya told CNN.
“But that doesn’t mean that everybody has the same capacity to do so.”
The burden of cost often falls on individuals, Chaya said, making it their responsibility to cope with the heat.
What is needed, he said, is a cohesive international plan that can protect the more vulnerable populations in the face of increasing climate change risks, and proactive measures to prevent potential health issues.
Governments need to develop large-scale solutions, such as early warning systems for heat, passive and active cooling for all, urban planning, and heat action plans, World Weather Attribution scientists recommended in their report.
Communities adapt to protect livelihoods
Intensifying heat waves not only affect individuals’ health, but threaten the environment and people’s livelihoods, worsen air quality, destroy crops, increase wildfire risk, and damage infrastructure – so the need for government action plans on heat waves are vital.
In Yotpieng and Phon villages in northeastern Laos, people’s livelihoods are intimately connected with weather patterns.
Villagers’ lives here revolve around tea. For centuries, every day at 7 a.m. the tea farmers start collecting leaves, until 11 a.m. when they would bring the harvest back home. The survival of these communities depends on collecting tea leaves to generate income for whole families.
But this year’s extreme heat is disrupting their ability to work according to their ancient working habits – they had to change from working in the morning to the afternoon during heat waves, and they are worried the quality and quantity of tea leaves will be affected, members of the local community told CNN.
”[The] weather is extremely hot for everyone this year and farmers are struggling,” according to Chintanaphone Keovichith, management officer at the Lao Farmer Network.
“This year the weather is hotter than last year, and the tea leaves are dry,” said tea farmer, Boua Seng.
The manager of a 1,000-year-old tea processing factory, Vieng Samai Lobia Yaw, said she is worried this year’s tea leaves have not grown enough, which decreases harvest by almost 50% daily.
“It’s so wasteful – we spend more capital on laborers’ fees but getting less product,” she said.
For now, tea farmers in Laos have invented solutions to protect their trees. Some have planted large fruit trees, such as peach or plum, to provide shade for tea plantations, while others added more compost to nourish their plants.
“The tea [trees] in the shade will have a nice green leaf, but the ones without shade will have yellow leaf,” explained tea farmer Thongsouk. “We also collect additional income by selling fruit products.”
But they cannot do it alone.
Without a comprehensive international approach to rapidly reduce planet-warming pollution and to address the interconnected impacts of extreme weather events on individuals, communities, and the environment, the health and economic costs from heat waves will only worsen as the climate crisis unfolds.
As May turns into June, many are still waiting for some respite.
“May was the worst month – that’s when the rain usually comes in, but this year [it] still hasn’t arrived yet,” said Chintanaphone.

"The Arctic may be sea ice-free in summer by the 2030s, new study warns",https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/world/arctic-sea-ice-free-climate-change/index.html,"The Arctic may be sea ice-free in summer by the 2030s, new study warns
The Arctic could be free of sea ice roughly a decade earlier than projected, scientists warn – another clear sign the climate crisis is happening faster than expected as the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution.
A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found Arctic sea ice could disappear completely during the month of September as early as the 2030s. Even if the world makes significant cuts to planet-heating pollution today, the Arctic could still see summers free of sea ice by the 2050s, scientists reported.
The researchers analyzed changes from 1979 to 2019, comparing different satellite data and climate models to assess how Arctic sea ice was changing.
They found that declining sea ice was largely the result of human-caused, planet-heating pollution, and previous models had underestimated Arctic sea ice melting trends.
“We were surprised to find that an ice-free Arctic will be there in summer irrespective of our effort at reducing emissions, which was not expected,” Seung-Ki Min, lead author of the study and professor at Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, told CNN.
Arctic ice builds up during the winter and then melts in the summer, typically reaching its lowest levels in September, before the cycle begins again.
Once Arctic summers become ice-free, the buildup of sea ice in the colder seasons will be much slower, Min said. The warmer it gets, the more likely the Arctic is to stay free of sea ice further into the colder season.
Under a “higher emissions pathway” – in which the world continues to burn fossil fuels and levels of planet-warming pollution continue to rise – the study projects the Arctic will see a complete loss of sea ice from August until as late as October before the 2080s, Min said.
The study’s findings contrast with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2021 state-of-the-science report, which found the Arctic would be “be practically ice-free near mid-century under intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.”
This new study shows it could happen 10 years earlier, regardless of emission scenarios, Min said.
Over the past several decades, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, a 2022 study showed. There has already been a rapid loss of sea ice in the region, with September sea ice shrinking at a rate of 12.6% per decade, according to NASA.
An Arctic with no summer sea ice would send dire ripple effects around the world. The bright white ice reflects solar energy away from the Earth. When this ice melts, it exposes the darker ocean, which absorbs more heat causing additional warming – a feedback process called “Arctic amplification.”
The decline of sea ice can also have an effect on global weather stretching well beyond the Arctic.
“We need to prepare ourselves for a world with warmer Arctic very soon,” Min said. “Since Arctic warming is suggested to bring weather extremes like heatwaves, wildfires, and floods on Northern mid- and high latitudes, the earlier onset of an ice-free Arctic also implies that we will be experiencing extreme events faster than predicted.”
A sea ice-free Arctic could also lead to an increase in commercial shipping as new routes open up, which would have a knock-on effect. According to last year’s annual Arctic report card by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a surge in shipping traffic would lead to more emissions and pollution in the region.
Mika Rantanen, researcher with the Finnish Meteorological Institute and lead author of the 2022 study, told CNN the study published Tuesday benefited from “novel and state-of-the-art methodology” to predict when the Arctic will be ice-free.
“The methodology is very careful and brings a high degree of certainty in the attribution,” said Rantanen, who was not involved in the study. “The most striking result is not that the sea ice loss is attributed to greenhouse gas increases, which was already largely known, but that they project ice-free Arctic earlier than previously thought by about decade.”
Min said the findings show that the Arctic is on the verge of becoming “seriously ill,” and that the region has reached a “tipping point.”
“We can regard the Arctic sea ice as the immune system of our body which protects our body from harmful things,” Min said. “Without the protector, the Arctic’s condition will go from bad to worse quickly.”"
First installment of new Obama oral history project focuses on climate,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/obama-oral-history-project-climate/index.html,"First installment of new Obama oral history project focuses on climate
A new oral history project focused on former President Barack Obama’s administration was released on Wednesday, with the first installment centering on climate.
The project consists of work completed by Incite, an interdisciplinary social science research institute at Columbia University, since 2019. The work from the past four years includes 470 interviews and about 1,100 hours of audio and video with senior officials, policymakers, activists and others involved with the Obama administration.
Peter Bearman, director of Incite at Columbia University, said the project was motivated by “an urge to decenter the experience of the president and center the study around the experiences and interactions of people both inside and outside of the administration.
He said many of the narratives in the first installment speak about key environmental and energy issues that took place during the Obama administration, including the Keystone Pipeline, food and food security, energy and international climate negotiations, such as the Paris Agreement.
Climate is one of about 40 issue domains the project focuses on. Other sets of interviews on topics such as health care and Black politics are planned to be released throughout the rest of this year and into 2024.
During a Wednesday discussion previewing the oral history project, panelists focused on climate change and the environment and discussed how climate was prominent in the Obama years, from his initial campaign and throughout his years in office.
“We pushed very hard during the campaign to raise the climate issue,” environmental activist Frances Beinecke said. “And we raised it during the primaries, and then when he was the candidate we raised it. During that period, we also worked on the platform, on the Democratic platform, making sure that climate was a main feature of the platform.”
The initial release consists of 17 of the hundreds of interviews. Former US Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Gina McCarthy and environmental activist Bill McKibben are among those interviewed in the first release of the series.
Valerie Jarrett, former senior adviser to Obama, referred to climate as “one of the largest threats and concerns” and “one of the biggest priorities” for Obama.
“By preserving these narratives, we ensure that future generations have access to the lived experiences and lessons learned,” Jarrett said during the event. “But ultimately, these interviews will serve a lot as an important record for both historians and scholars, to not just learn, but to learn with an act towards the future.”"
"If climate goals are meant to protect us from ‘significant harm,’ then they aren’t good enough, scientists say",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/us/just-climate-thresholds-significant-harm-study/index.html,"If climate goals are meant to protect us from ‘significant harm,’ then they aren’t good enough, scientists say
For years, the world has been focusing on a key climate change threshold: limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But even at that threshold – which could begin to be breached within the next five years – millions of people will still face “significant harm,” including death, displacement and food and water scarcity, an international commission of researchers reported Wednesday.
In a study published in the journal Nature, the panel of more than a dozen researchers integrated environmental justice – the idea that climate thresholds should minimize significant harm – with climate science. And with that standard, they found the world has already breached critical boundaries, leaving less safe, habitable space for life on Earth.
At 1.5 degrees Celsius, the authors found that more than 200 million people could still be exposed to unprecedented heat, and more than 500 million people would be exposed to longterm sea level rise. And they said that the key climate threshold nations pledged to meet in the Paris Agreement in 2015 – one that would ensure a “safe and just” world – should have been 1 degree Celsius.
But the planet’s average temperature has already soared to around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, which has already triggered catastrophic and deadly climate and weather changes, including more extreme heat waves, floods and landscape-altering wildfires.
“Science is showing clearly that we are at risk of destabilizing the entire planet and its life support systems,” said Johan Rockström, the lead author on the study and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and co-chair of the Earth Commission.
“Unfortunately, the doctor will tell you that we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these living components that build up this complex, adaptive, self-regulating system,” he told reporters, likening the study to a doctor’s visit, and that the prescription is “a list of quantitative safe and just boundary conditions that you have to live within to be able to cure yourself.”
While past scientific efforts to define Earth’s boundaries have been strong and compelling, climate science has historically looked at the conditions needed to maintain the planet’s stability, but excluded justice as a key component, said Joyeeta Gupta, a co-author on the study and an environmental researcher at the University of Amsterdam.
“We argue that there is no safe planet without justice,” Gupta said, underscoring that incorporating justice to the Earth system’s boundaries reduces significant harm to communities and individuals.
The research is a “worthy attempt” to identify and quantify the human toll associated with different levels of environmental degradation, such as climate change, water availability and biodiversity, said Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study but was a lead author on the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
“This paper highlights the human costs of the emissions choices we are making every single year – costs that will extend many generations into the future, when we do not move to enact emissions in line with the most ambitious targets,” Cobb told CNN. It also “provides further ammunition to climate justice advocates as policymakers seek a greater understanding of how continued warming will worsen existing climate injustices from region to region and across the next decades to centuries.”
Scientists are calling on governments, businesses and policymakers to take the crisis more seriously as climate thresholds are breached and the world gets warmer.
“The intention of this paper was to try and show that there is already a lot of damage at 1 degree, and that this is more just than a 1.5-degree target,” Gupta said. “We want to make sure that countries take this as seriously as possible.”"
"Global temperature rise could see billions live in places where human life doesn’t flourish, study says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/asia/global-warming-billions-dangerous-climate-heat-report-intl-hnk/index.html,"Global temperature rise could see billions live in places where human life doesn’t flourish, study says
If the current pace of global warming goes unchecked, it will push billions of people outside the “climate niche,” the temperatures where humans can flourish, and expose them to dangerously hot conditions, according to a new study published Monday.
The study, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, evaluated the impact on humans if the world continues on its projected trajectory and warms 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial temperatures.
Factoring in both the expected global warming and population growth, the study found that by 2030 around two billion people will be outside the climate niche, facing average temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher, with around 3.7 billion living outside the niche by 2090.
Timothy Lenton, one of the study’s two lead authors, said that one third of the global population could find themselves living in climate conditions that don’t support “human flourishing.”
“That’s a profound reshaping of the habitability of the surface of the planet and it could lead potentially to large scale reorganization of where people live,” Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, said in a video shared by the institute.
According to the report, the niche consists of places where the annual average temperature spans from 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit) to around 27 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Celsius). Outside this window, conditions tend to be too hot, too cold or too dry.
The study determined that while less than 1% of the global population is currently exposed to dangerous heat, with average temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius or higher, climate change has already put more than 600 million people outside the niche.
“Most of these people lived near the cooler 13 degree Celsius peak of the niche and are now in the ‘middle ground’ between the two peaks. While not dangerously hot, these conditions tend to be much drier and have not historically supported dense human populations,” said study co-author Chi Xu, a professor at Nanjing University.
If the Earth warms 2.7 degrees Celsius, India, Nigeria, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan would be the top five countries with the most population exposed to dangerous heat levels, the study found.
The entire population of some countries, such as Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as small islands already at risk from rising sea levels, would face unprecedented high temperatures.
In the worst case scenarios, if the Earth warms up by 3.6 or even 4.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, half of the world’s population would be outside the climate niche, constituting what the report calls “an existential risk.”
According to the report, living outside the niche could lead to increased mortality rates, as exposure to temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius could be lethal, especially if humidity is so high the body can no longer cool itself to a temperature that can maintain normal functions.
Extreme heat is also predicted to decrease crop yields, and increase conflict and the spread of disease.
Scientists have long warned that warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius would result in catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes. As the areas within the climate niche shrink as global temperatures rise, a larger swath of the population will also be more frequently exposed to extreme weather events including droughts, storms, wildfires and heatwaves.
Experts say there is still time to slow the pace of global warming by moving away from burning oil, coal and gas and toward clean energy, but the window is closing.
Every fraction of a degree will make a difference, Lenton said. “For every 0.1 degrees Celsius of warming above present levels, about 140 million more people will be exposed to dangerous heat.”
Earlier this month, the World Meteorological Organization announced that within the next five years, there is a 66% chance that the planet’s temperature will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels for at least one year.
“We’ve left it so late to tackle climate change properly that we’re now at a point that to achieve the rate of change we need, means something like a five times speeding up of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions or the decarbonization of the global economy,” Lenton said."

As the largest ocean in the world, the Pacific is home to more than 2 million people across 22 countries and 30,000 islands. But with a warming planet and rising sea levels, countless ancestral homes, biodiverse ecosystems, and traditional ways of life are increasingly becoming more endangered.
“The single greatest threat to our very existence is climate change,” said former Fijian Defense Minister Inia Seruiratu in 2022. “It threatens our very hopes and dreams of prosperity.”
At least five islands have already been lost to the sea. Some Pacific Islanders have had to leave as climate refugees. But for the communities that remain, many organizations are helping to advance climate justice, sustainability, and conservation on the frontlines of the crisis.

‘Sounding the alarm’: World on track to breach a critical warming threshold in the next five years,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/17/world/global-warming-breach-wmo-climate-intl/index.html,"‘Sounding the alarm’: World on track to breach a critical warming threshold in the next five years
The world is now likely to breach a key climate threshold for the first time within the next five years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, due to a combination of heat-trapping pollution and a looming El Niño.
Global temperatures have soared in recent years as the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. And that trend shows no sign of slowing. In its annual climate update, the WMO said that between 2023 and 2027, there is now a 66% chance that the planet’s temperature will climb above 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels for at least one year.
As temperatures surge, there is also a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years – and the five-year period as a whole – will be the warmest on record for the planet, the WMO reported.
Breaching the 1.5-degree threshold may only be temporary, the WMO said, but it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating – hastening sea level rise, more extreme weather and the demise of vital ecosystems.
Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
“This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas, in a statement.
The temperature increases are fueled by the rise of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels, as well as the predicted arrival of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon with a global heating effect.
“A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” Taalas said. “This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.”
The current hottest year on record is 2016, which followed a very strong El Niño event. El Niño tends to ramp up the temperatures the year after it develops, which could put 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record.
The world has already seen around 1.2 degrees of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. And despite three years of cooling La Niña, temperatures have soared to dangerous levels. The last eight years were the warmest on record.
The report stated that the chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius has risen steadily since 2015, when the WMO put the chance of breaching this threshold at close to zero.
The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year between 2023 and 2027 is predicted to be between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degree Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 average, said the WMO. That refers to the period before the sharp increase of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels.
“Global mean temperatures are predicted to continue increasing, moving us away further and further away from the climate we are used to,” said Leon Hermanson,  a Met Office expert scientist who led the report, in a statement.
Why does 1.5 degrees matter?
Scientists have long warned that the world needs to stay within 1.5 degrees of warming to avoid catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes.
Warming above this point increases the risk of triggering major tipping points, including the death of coral reefs and the melting of polar ice sheets, which will add to sea level rise, devastating coastal communities.
In the US alone, 13 million people could be forced to relocate because of sea level rise by the end of the century. For many low-lying Pacific Island nations, warming over 1.5 degrees is a threat to their survival.
Temperature rises also increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms, wildfires and heatwaves.
Already this year a slew of temperature records have been broken – and in some cases smashed – across the world.
In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. High temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April, while record-breaking temperatures scorched locations in the Pacific Northwest in May.
Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees could reduce the number of people exposed to extreme heatwaves by around 420 million, according to NASA.
The window to act is closing
The 1.5 threshold may be important, but it’s not a tipping point in itself.
With every fraction of a degree the world warms, the worse the effects will be. But, that also means every fraction of a degree by which warming can be reduced, will help.
Scientists say that, while the window to act is fact closing, there is still time to reduce global warming by moving away from burning oil, coal and gas and toward clean energy.
Many have also called for adaptation measures to prepare for the climate impacts that are already baked in, such as vast coastal walls to protect communities from sea level rise.
Countries will meet at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai at the end of the year, where they will undertake a “global stocktake” – an assessment of their progress toward targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement.
They are expected to be a long way off track on meeting goals to keep within 1.5 degrees of warming by cutting planet-heating pollution by more than 40% by 2030."

Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.
The West has taken a dive straight into summer, with temperatures well above those normally seen even at the end of July. Record-breaking temperatures and a heat wave will continue to grip the entire region through much of this week.
Yesterday, several locations across the Pacific Northwest broke daily high temperature records:
“Today will be the 4th day in a row with highs in the 80s for Seattle,” the National Weather Service office in Seattle said. “This will tie the record for most consecutive days with highs 80 degrees plus in the month of May.”
For reference, Seattle’s normal high at the end of July is around 79 degrees, so temperatures are well above even the normal highs seen in the dog days of summer.
Many people in the Pacific Northwest do not have air conditioning, and with overnight lows running warm as well, the body is not able to easily recover from the daytime heat. It has prompted heat alerts for more than 10 million people across the Pacific Northwest and portions of Central California.
The weather setup very much resembles a weather pattern seen in the middle of summer for the region. A big dome of high pressure is sitting over the Northwest, allowing dry, downslope winds to come off the mountains, spiking temperatures well above average.
As the heat continues to build this week, nearly 150 high temperature records will be in jeopardy across the West.
While the heat will spread farther east throughout the week to include the Rockies and central and southern Plains, the most dramatic heat will be in the West. Temperatures are running 20 to 30 degrees above normal across the Pacific Northwest.
“To put it in perspective, highs will be near record values each day,” the weather service in Boise, Idaho, said. “These hot temperatures will increase snowmelt in the mountains. Mainstream rivers fed by snowpack will be running high, swift and cold.”
Weather service offices all across the West are urging people to stay out of the water and find relief from the heat in other ways. Water temperatures are in the 50s for the most part, cold enough to cause cold water shock and hyperthermia.
This heat is not just affecting the US. It has been even more extreme across western portions of Canada.
Several cities across British Columbia set new monthly records Sunday, including Lytton, which topped out around 97 degrees; hotter than the average temperature Phoenix, Arizona, experiences around this time of year.
Environment Canada has issued heat warnings for northern portions of Alberta and portions of British Columbia, where high temperatures are forecast to reach the mid 80s. Temperatures here are running 15 to 25 degrees above normal, so the weather agency is urging people to cancel outdoor plans if they aren’t necessary, as heat-related illnesses are possible.
One bit of good news is, “While the developing heat may result in daily temperature records being broken, it must be emphasized that the expected hot conditions will not approach those reached during the ‘Heat Dome’ of late June 2021,” Environment Canada said.
The heat is also having a huge effect on Canada’s active start to the fire season. There are currently 89 fires burning in Alberta alone, where fires have scorched 1.3 million acres so far this year. It puts 2023 as the fifth-busiest fire season on record in Alberta, and we still have several months of fire season yet to go.
While the hottest temperatures may have peaked over the weekend, the long-range outlook looks to remain quite warm for the Northwest.
The Climate Prediction Center has the Northwest above normal as far as temperatures go through the next two weeks at least. While it doesn’t mean temperatures will be as extreme as they currently are, the trend is definitely on the warmer side.

More than 50 high temperature records could be broken through Monday as heat builds across the western US and Canada.
Temperatures will run as much as 25 degrees above normal, with temperatures possibly hitting 90 degrees this weekend or early next week in Seattle.
If this happens, this would be the earliest 90-degree day on record for Seattle.
Areas around Portland, Oregon, could be in record-breaking territory for four days straight, from Friday through Monday, with highs expected to climb into the 90s.
“A strong upper-level dome of high pressure will entrench itself across the Pacific NW and British Columbia this weekend,” CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. “It’s really the perfect set-up for those who love summer warmth because the winds near the ground will turn offshore throughout the weekend allowing for dry, downsloping winds to spike temperatures well above average.”
Roughly 12 million people in the US are under heat alerts, including residents of western Washington, western Oregon, portions of northern California and the San Joaquin Valley.
High temperatures will approach triple digit readings in the San Joaquin Valley this weekend into early next week, resulting in a moderate risk for heat-related illnesses for heat-sensitive groups and people who are new to the area if simple precautions are not taken. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/DCKt8Yoinh
“Temperatures in the mid to high 90’s are expected to start tomorrow and will continue through next week, with Sunday and Monday being the warmest days in the high 90’s and possibly reaching the triple digits for the first time this year,” the National Weather Service office in Hanford, California, said, about Saturday’s forecast.
The hot temperatures in the Valley will translate into hot temperatures in higher elevations too, resulting in melting snow.
“This will cause rivers and streams to run high and possibly flood. Be cautious around these rivers and streams as they will be running high and fast, and will also be very cold,” the weather service office in Hanford warns.
Overnight temperatures will also stay much warmer than normal, which won’t allow the body the relief it needs from the extreme heat. This could exacerbate heat illnesses for those without air conditioning.
The heat will stretch as far north as Canada through the weekend as well. The Canadian weather agency, Environment Canada, has issued a special weather statement warning of the extreme temperatures for portions of British Columbia and Alberta.
Temperatures will be running as much as 25 to 30 degrees above normal for some locations, reaching as high as the low 90s, which will make the ongoing wildfire problem even worse.
Wildfires continue to rage across Canada
Nearly 150 wildfires are burning across Canada, 82 of which are in Alberta. The province is getting off to one of its fastest starts to the wildfire season this year, with roughly 1.1 million acres already burned to date.
“The last time Alberta had this fast of a start to the wildfire season was 2016,” Provincial Information Officer for Alberta Wildfire, Josée St-Onge, told CNN.
By this date in 2016, 488 wildfires had burned more than 1.2 million acres. By comparison, so far this year we have seen 426 wildfires, which have burned nearly 1.1 million acres.
The wildfire smoke now covers much of Canada and has even entered the Northeast US. Portions of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are under air quality alerts, including Washington, DC and Philadelphia, as the smoke particles will be unhealthy for sensitive groups.

May is a very busy month for wildfires across Canada, and the season typically continues through the summer. If the current pace continues in Alberta, 2023 could break into the top 5 years for acreage burned by next week, with still much of the fire season remaining.
These are the five years with the most burned acreage in Alberta:
This hot air is isolated in the West, as of now. Across the foothills and Rockies, temperatures will be quite different, running 15 to 25 degrees below normal."
Why John Kerry is confident Biden’s climate policies can survive a Republican president,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/12/politics/john-kerry-republicans-china-biden-climate/index.html,"Why John Kerry is confident Biden’s climate policies can survive a Republican president
As the US barrels into a high-stakes and consequential election cycle, US climate envoy and former Secretary of State John Kerry is confident of one thing: If a Republican is elected president, they won’t be able to reverse the Biden administration’s wins on climate change and clean energy.
The economy has so drastically and fundamentally changed in the past several years, Kerry argued – spurred in large part by the Democrats’ climate and energy law passed last year – that the markets would reject a challenge to the nation’s clean energy trajectory.
“I don’t think anybody elected president – Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative – could change what is happening today,” President Joe Biden’s top climate diplomat told CNN in a candid and wide-ranging interview in his State Department office.
“The power of the marketplace is bigger than the presidency on (climate change) now,” Kerry said. “So much money has been invested in retooling and redirecting business strategies and investments.”
Kerry has been pleasantly surprised at the pace that clean energy manufacturing, electric vehicle and battery factories are flocking to the US, and noted EU officials are “a little annoyed” about generous US clean energy subsidies drawing business away from them.
“Our message to them is ‘do the same thing; let’s get going,’” Kerry told CNN. “We have made a giant leap forward.”
The 79-year-old Kerry – who has served as Biden’s climate envoy long after Washington insiders assumed he would retire – is gearing up for his third international climate summit this November in Dubai. He speaks to Biden “when I need to talk to him” and described the president as “super seized” by international climate issues.
Despite whispers of a possible retirement that started two years ago, he’s outlasted multiple staff members, visited Mexico, Brazil, Europe and Japan this year alone, and is showing few signs of slowing.
Kerry and his team are actively working on an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua after Xie recently recovered from a serious illness for which he was hospitalized, Kerry said. There is still lots of unfinished business between the US and China, the world’s two largest emitters.
“At some point, we’re going to travel over there and pick up where we left off,” Kerry said.
Negotiations with China
Sitting behind his desk, Kerry ticked off three issues he hopes to resolve with China: the country implementing its plan to cut emissions of super-polluting methane, demonstrating it can move away from coal faster and working together on the issue of deforestation.
“Those are the three things that are on the table as a result of the meetings that we had” last year, Kerry said. “Now, we’d like to go further, and we think there are things that we could cooperate on.”
Kerry and Xie have known each other for 25 years, Kerry said. And their work together has been a relative bright spot amid a thorny US and China relationship.
But the climate envoys haven’t been immune; China abruptly pulled out of ongoing climate talks last year after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan in the face of fierce objection from China. The two countries agreed to resume at COP27 in Egypt late last year, but Kerry got Covid at the conference, leaving little time for actual negotiation.
China announced in 2021 that it would develop a plan to limit emissions of methane – an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that scientists have focused on in recent years as a critical climate issue. Kerry said he has seen China’s methane plan but told CNN he is not sure if they have updated or strengthened it since.
“It’s very possible; they’ve been deploying a lot of renewables in the last six, seven months,” Kerry said. “I’m not sure whether their plans may have shifted, that’s part of what we need to talk about.”
A world off-track
Though he was optimistic about cooperation with China, Kerry was blunt about the world’s chances to stave off the worst of the climate crisis. Nations are way off-track on their goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
“No,” he told CNN. “Tragically, right now, not enough people are doing enough to achieve that goal.”
Kerry said he was heartened to see some countries, including the US, making significant progress by moving to clean energy. But there are still too many that are moving slowly from fossil fuels – particularly the dirtiest one, coal.
“What is not exciting is there’s too much coal use still and too much unabated fossil fuel emissions that are fouling the air,” Kerry said. “We need to move much faster to bring ourselves in alignment with the 1.5-degree goal.”
Kerry noted India has set an aggressive target of adding 500 gigawatts of renewable energy to its grid, even as it remains highly dependent on coal.
“That’s a huge goal,” Kerry said. “They’re pushing very hard to try to achieve that. We want to help them, bringing finance to the table or other things. And if they do that, they would be in alignment with 1.5 [degrees Celsius].”
Kerry added that it is difficult for climate models to quantify how quickly progress is being made as the Inflation Reduction Act spurs private investment in clean energy, which he called a “monumental accomplishment.”
“That’s one of the things I find really super encouraging,” Kerry said. “I don’t think any of us who are looking at these models have an ability to be able to define, with accuracy, what the impact is of all the investment, all the private sector decisions that get made. I truly believe that we’re in a better place than we’ve been in a number of years because of the changes that are taking place.”
House Republican investigations
The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into Kerry’s role in the administration, and the “nature” of his negotiations with China. Kerry told CNN he hopes his climate negotiations are not politicized.
“This is not a partisan issue. This should have nothing to do with politics,” Kerry said. “We’re all looking for the best marketplace solutions, the best things that we can do to create jobs, accelerate the transition, increase the health and safety of Americans by cleaning up the air and getting rid of the pollution.”
Kerry also said he has been in touch with House Republicans on climate proactively, meeting with the Conservative Climate Caucus, a group chaired by Rep. John Curtis of Utah.
“I think we’re going to maybe get a smaller group together; we talked about getting together,” Kerry said. “I’m open to talking anytime.”
‘Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good’
Despite Biden’s significant climate wins in Congress, the president has taken a hit among young voters for approving the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska earlier this year.
While Kerry reiterated that the Biden administration was legally hamstrung by previously contracts with oil company ConocoPhillips, he encouraged youth activists and voters to look at the bigger picture of the administration’s climate progress.
“Look at the difference between Donald Trump, if that’s the nominee, or any other Republican who haven’t stepped up in this issue, and what the Biden administration is doing,” Kerry said. “And don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
But the Vietnam veteran and former anti-war activist added he sympathized with young people and encouraged them to continue to speak up.
“I understand the feelings people have about Willow; there is an appearance of a contradiction because you see some drilling possibilities even as you’re trying to move away from dependency on unabated fossil fuels,” Kerry said. “Wherever I go, I ask young people, ‘Look, let’s be more militant, all of us.’ We’ve got to go out and demand more, push for more, and don’t take ‘less-than’ for an answer.”"
EPA proposes new rules that would dramatically slash planet-warming pollution from power plants,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/epa-power-plant-rules-climate/index.html,"EPA proposes new rules that would dramatically slash planet-warming pollution from power plants
The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday proposed one of its most highly anticipated climate rules to date, compelling nearly all US power plants that generate the nation’s electricity to capture or otherwise slash their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions.
The rules would apply to the nation’s fleet of existing and new power plants that run on coal and natural gas – two major fossil fuels, which are the root cause of the climate crisis. The Biden administration’s proposal would push utilities to outfit many power plants with costly carbon capture technology or add clean hydrogen fuel to reduce their emissions.
Unlike the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which faced fierce opposition that rose to the Supreme Court, the proposed rules will leave it to individual utilities to choose how to meet the emissions standards – which will ultimately be implemented and enforced by individual states, EPA officials said. Some power plants that are slated to close in the next few years may not have to meet the new requirements.
Between 2028 and 2042, the EPA estimated the rules would cut about 617 million metric tons of carbon pollution from existing coal and new gas plants. In addition, the agency estimates the rules will cut between 214 and 407 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from existing gas plants.
EPA and White House officials said the proposed rules would help meet President Joe Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, while only marginally raising costs for the nation’s ratepayers. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said his agency estimated that while baseline electricity costs would go up 2% by 2030, they would rise just 0.08% further by 2040.
“We believe that where we will end up will be squarely in line with the president’s goal,” Regan told reporters. “We’re looking at a negligible impact on electricity prices, while yielding climate and public health benefits that far exceed those costs.”
Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Biden said the new EPA rules proposal “kicks off a public commitment to engage with labor and industry and environmentalists and other experts to make sure we make a major step forward in the climate crisis, protecting public health.”
Combined with a larger suite of regulations aimed at cutting pollution from oil and gas, vehicles, refrigerants, the new rules that the EPA has put forth in the past few years could save up to 15 billion metric tons of plant-warming pollution, Regan said.
Much of that comes from the administration’s recent proposals to cut vehicle emissions, but the clean power plant rules are critical. The power sector makes up a quarter of overall US emissions, but it holds outsized importance since it will provide power for electric vehicles and help decarbonize heavy industry.
“Getting carbon pollution out of the power sector is the lynchpin by which we tackle carbon pollution throughout the rest of the economy,” Sam Ricketts, a former adviser to Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee who now works with Evergreen Action and the Center for American Progress, told CNN.
The rule will likely face new legal challenges and political headaches. But Regan said the new power plant rules “would bring us one step closer in our mission to safeguard the air our children breathe.”
How the new power plant rules would work
The Obama-era Clean Power Plan focused on getting power plants to change how they generated electricity, and ultimately was blocked by Supreme Court. But the Biden EPA’s proposal focuses on outfitting existing plants with technology to capture pollution before it escapes into the air, and it gives utilities the ability to choose how they meet the new standard.
The agency is betting that much if this can be done through carbon capture and sequestration: catching carbon pollution at its source, after which it can be stored or reused. According to the EPA rules, carbon capture would be used for baseload power plants that generate a lot of electricity and expect to have a long life – operating after the year 2040.
For plants that generate less electricity, or ones that are shutting down earlier, the rules would be different. For instance, some categories of plants could add clean hydrogen to the mix – starting at 30% clean hydrogen early in the 2030s and ramping up to over 90% clean hydrogen by the end of the decade.
“Each power plant is going to have its own individual set of circumstances,” Jay Duffy, an attorney and expert on power plant emissions at nonpartisan group Clean Air Task Force, told CNN. “Some of them may already be old and marginal, and it might make more sense for them to not make some big pollution control investment later in their life.”
Many of the proposed rules would go into effect years from now – a recognition from the EPA that much of this technology isn’t in wide use yet.
Carbon capture has traditionally been quite expensive to add to power plants, causing some utilities to choose to shut plants down and replace them with cheaper, renewable energy like solar or wind.  However, the Inflation Reduction Act came with significant subsidies for carbon capture to make the technology cheaper and on par with other technologies that can cut emissions.
“Essentially, the costs of (carbon capture) are minimal” and comparable to other technologies given the tax credits in the IRA, Duffy said.
Still, a utility industry source said that even if IRA subsidies bring the costs down, there’s no escaping the fact that there’s little existing pipeline and storage infrastructure for captured carbon in the US. Clean hydrogen projects are similarly nascent, the source said.
But others said the long timelines and some flexibility for industry in EPA’s proposed rule is a recognition of that.
“They’re trying to phase it in over time,” Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, told CNN. “I’m sure they’re considering the infrastructure that’s needed.”
Regan told reporters that some plants would shut down, though didn’t offer a precise number.
“The short answer is yes, we will see some retirements within the system,” Regan said. “But this is really a decision that will be made state by state, company by company.”
The rules could face challenges
The new EPA rules landed with immediate criticism from lawmakers and officials in a coal-heavy state.
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has already vowed to oppose any future EPA nominee in the Senate over the rule. Meanwhile, Manchin’s Republican colleague Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia called it an attempt to “kill American energy jobs” and vowed to introduce a Congressional Review Act bill to attempt to overturn it.
And though the EPA’s regulatory ability survived one Supreme Court challenge last year, it could face new attempts to squash it. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey suggested the rules were headed for a court battle.
“Based upon what we currently know about this proposal, it is not going to be upheld, and it just seems designed to scare more coal-fired power plants into retirement — the goal of the Biden administration,” Morrisey, a Republican, said in a statement. “That tactic is unacceptable, and this rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law. The U.S. Supreme Court has placed significant limits on what the EPA can do — we plan on ensuring that those limits are upheld, and we expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.”
Still, administration officials and advocates underscored they believed the rule comports with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in West Virginia v. EPA and is one that will survive future legal challenges.
“I have confidence in its durability,” Ricketts said. “The EPA has learned the lessons. … I think they’re operating tightly in the bounds of what the Clean Air Act and Supreme Court allow.”
While Duffy said it would be no surprise if the new rules were challenged in the courts, he added that he “wouldn’t expect this rule to present the same sort of big legal questions that the Supreme Court usually takes up.”
Regan announced the new proposed rules on Thursday at the University of Maryland where he spoke directly to young voters about the Biden administration’s climate goals.
The slate of EPA rules combating pollution, Regan said, made him “optimistic about what’s possible for the future of our nation.”

"Australia’s colossal bushfires likely made La Niña worse, study finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/australia/australia-bushfire-la-nina-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Australia’s colossal bushfires likely made La Niña worse, study finds
Smoke from Australia’s worst wildfires in decades may have contributed to the rare triple La Niña weather event that impacted continents thousands of miles away, according to new research.
Flames burned through 46 million acres from June 2019 to January 2020 – during Australia’s summer months – thrusting emissions into the Earth’s atmosphere and potentially shifting weather patterns, said a study published in Science Advances on Wednesday.
The study, led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), said the disaster was “exceptional in both its severity and particulate emissions,” releasing smoke levels similar to a major volcanic eruption.
Scientists John Fasullo, Nan Rosenbloom and Rebecca Buchholz from NCAR in the United States used new modeling to demonstrate how emissions from the bushfires may have shifted weather patterns.
Their research suggests smoke emissions led to the formation of clouds over the southeastern Pacific Ocean, which absorbed radiation from the sun and cooled surface water temperatures.
These disruptions may have helped trigger the rare three-year La Niña event, that brings wetter and cooler conditions to the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains of the US, especially during the winter, and drier and warmer conditions in the south.
The recent La Niña event stretched from late 2020 to early 2023 – an unusually long period that created a series of devastating tropical cyclones and intense hurricanes in some places and exacerbated drought in others.
Australia was also dragged to extremes, suffering historic rainfall and floods over that period.
“Many people quickly forgot about the Australian fires, especially as the COVID pandemic exploded, but the Earth system has a long memory, and the impacts of the fires lingered for years,” said NCAR scientist Fasullo, lead author of the study.
How did wildfire emissions set off La Niña?
Scientists have previously established that large volcanic eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere can shift the odds toward the formation of La Niña. In such instances, smoke high in the atmosphere results in the formation of light-reflecting particles called aerosols, which can cool the climate and ultimately create favorable conditions for La Niña.
This time researchers found that smoke aerosols from the unprecedented Australia wildfire season had brightened cloud decks, especially off the coast of Peru, which cooled and dried the air in the region. That ultimately shifted the zone where the northern and southern trade winds come together, cooling the Pacific Ocean and creating the perfect conditions for the La Niña formation.
Although the emissions from the fires lingered in the atmosphere for several months, it triggered an even longer feedback loop that created successive La Niña weather patterns for years.
“The results here suggest a potential connection between this emergence of cool conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the climate response to the Australian wildfire emissions,” the paper stated.
Australian climate scientist Tom Mortlock, who was not involved in the study, said the research was “the first time a bushfire event has been widespread enough to have an impact in climate models,” and highlighted the “interconnectivity of the climate system.”
The recent La Niña streak is also unusual because it is the only one that did not follow a strong El Niño – the opposite pattern of warming instead of cooling in the Tropical Pacific.
This year, weather agencies are forecasting a more severe El Niño, exacerbated by warming global temperatures, which may bring impacts like extreme heat, dangerous tropical cyclones and a significant threat to fragile coral reefs."
Vietnam and Laos record hottest temperatures ever as heat wave grips Southeast Asia,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/asia/vietnam-laos-record-high-temperatures-intl-hnk/index.html,"Vietnam and Laos record hottest temperatures ever as heat wave grips Southeast Asia
Temperature records tumbled across Southeast Asia over the weekend as the region swelters under a weekslong heat wave that has brought misery to millions.
All-time highs were recorded in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand’s capital, where the heat has been compounded by an intense smoggy season that has caused pollution levels to spike.
Scientists have long warned that heat waves are set to get worse as the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate.
In Vietnam, temperatures reached 44.2 degrees Celsius (around 111.6 Fahrenheit) on Saturday in the northern district of Tuong Duong – the highest temperature ever recorded in the country, according to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera.
In neighboring Laos, the city of Luang Prabang hit 43.5 degrees Celsius (110.3 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, breaking the national record of 42.7 degrees Celsius (108.9 Fahrenheit) that was only set last month, Herrera said.
The Laotian capital Vientiane also broke its all-time record this weekend with a temperature of 42.5 degrees Celsius (108.5 Fahrenheit).
Meanwhile in Thailand, Saturday saw the hottest ever temperature recorded in Bangkok – 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 Fahrenheit).
The capital is among large parts of Thailand that have suffered under temperatures in the upper 30s to low 40s Celsius since late March. In mid-April, the northwest city of Tak became the first place in the country to top 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit), according to Herrera, using data from the Thai Meteorological Department.
Last month, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over “dangerously high temperatures in various parts of Thailand.”
April and May are typically the hottest months of the year for South and Southeast Asia as temperatures rise before annual monsoon rains bring some relief.
Temperatures across the region are expected to return closer to average in the coming days, but unprecedented heat events are becoming more common as the climate crisis intensifies.
A 2022 study determined that dangerous heat waves, at temperatures of 39.4 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) and above, will occur between three and 10 times more often by the turn of the century.
In the tropics, which encompasses much of Asia, the study found that days of “extremely dangerous heat” – defined as 51 degrees Celsius (124 Fahrenheit) – could double, putting the population of impacted countries at risk.
“By definition, we don’t know what could happen if large populations are exposed to unprecedented heat and humidity stress,” the study’s lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello from Harvard University previously told CNN, “but heat waves in the past few decades have already been extremely deadly and there is serious cause for concern in the future.”

"Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/05/world/ocean-surface-temperature-heat-record-climate-intl/index.html,"Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed
Ocean surface heat is at record-breaking levels. Temperatures began climbing in mid-March and skyrocketed over the course of several weeks, leaving scientists scrambling to figure out exactly why.
Temperatures have fallen since their peak in April – as they naturally do in the spring – but they are still higher than they have ever been on record for this time of year.
“It is remarkable,” said Gregory C. Johnson, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates the ocean surface temperature using a network of ships, buoys, satellites and floats.
Although it’s still preliminary data, if it holds up, he said, “this is another milestone.”
The record may not seem huge – it’s nearly two-tenths of a degree higher than the previous record in 2016 – but given how much heat is needed to warm up this huge body of water, “it’s a massive amount of energy,” Matthew England, professor of ocean and climate dynamics at the University of New South Wales, Australia, told CNN.
What’s behind this rapid increase isn’t totally clear yet. “These temperatures just rocketed up, people haven’t had a chance to puzzle it all out,” Johnson said.
Some scientists are concerned the scale of these new records could mark the start of an alarming trend. Others say record-breaking temperatures like these are always concerning but to be expected given the human-caused climate crisis.
All agree the consequences are likely to be significant. Warmer oceans bleach coral, kill marine life, increase sea level rise and make the ocean less efficient at absorbing planet-warming pollution – the warmer oceans get, the more the planet will heat.
The return of El Niño
One major driver of the heat is believed to be an approaching – and potentially strong – El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation associated with warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which has a global heating effect.
The world has just emerged from a 3-year La Niña, El Niño’s cooler counterpart, which has helped mask the full impact of global warming. Since La Niña ended in March, ocean temperatures seem to be on a rebound, scientists say.
“It’s a little bit like we’ve had the freezer door open for a while and it’s helped to cool the planet,” Johnson said. But even while that freezer has been open, background temperatures have continued to rise. Now the freezer is closed, everything is hotter than before.
The World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday there is about an 80% chance El Niño will develop between July and September. But part of what has puzzled scientists is temperatures have risen so much before it has even arrived.
Some are concerned this suggests climate change might be progressing in ways climate models have not predicted.
“An El Niño event is brewing, but it’s probably too early to blame that as the cause,” professor Mike Meredith, science leader at the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN. “It’s vital that we find out what is causing [the peak in ocean surface temperature] though, and understand whether this is an isolated extreme high or the start of an even more worrying trend.”
Deeper ocean heat
Surface temperatures tell one story about what’s happening to the world’s oceans.
But to understand where the world is heading in the long term, it’s important to also look at the deeper ocean temperatures, said Sarah Purkey, an assistant professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
Thousands of floats in the world’s oceans measure its heat content, analyzing temperature from the surface down to the deep waters, feeding back data.
“Ocean heat content has been on a very steady, sometimes accelerating, rise,” Purkey told CNN, because of human-caused global warming. The oceans absorb around 90% of the excess heat the world produces, as well as around 25% of carbon pollution.
In 2022, the oceans were the warmest on record for the fourth year in a row.
A study published in April found the heat in the climate system was accelerating, spelling bad news for the oceans.
It found the rate of change in how much heat the Earth has accumulated has more than doubled over the last two decades – and most of that is going into the ocean.
“There’s a really urgent need to understand this because if it’s part of a long term trend, this is really highly concerning,” said Karina von Schuckmann, an oceanographer at Mercator Ocean International in France and a co-author on the study.
One surprising reason could be the reduction of aerosols in the atmosphere. In 2020, regulations were introduced to limit the amount of sulfur in the fuel ships used – a policy aimed at addressing air pollution.
Though air pollution has a significant impact on human health, it also acts as an artificial sunscreen and reflects sunlight away from the Earth. One theory is the absence of aerosols may have turned up the heat, von Schuckmann said.
Worrying impacts of ocean warming
Whatever the reasons behind the increase in ocean heat, the impacts are potentially catastrophic if temperatures continue to head off the charts.
The oceans shield us from the full impacts of the climate crisis. “We should thank the ocean for taking up most of what we’ve done to the climate system, otherwise we would be seeing effects that are really 100 times what we’re seeing right now,” Purkey said.
But this buffering role comes at a high cost.
Hotter oceans cause coral reef bleaching and are linked to toxic algae blooms, which can suck oxygen from the water and choke marine life, sometimes forcing fisheries to close. Warmer waters are also less effective at absorbing carbon, which means more is left in the atmosphere, which in turn fuels more global warming.
Sea level rises as water warms – not only through the melting of ice sheets, but water also expands as it heats up.
Surface warming supercharges cyclones and hurricanes.
Scientists are particularly concerned about the impact of warming on meridional overturning currents, ocean “conveyor belts” that push surface water to the deeper ocean and play a key role in regulating the planet’s energy balance. “It’s probably the most important thing to monitor,” said Purkey.
The strength of the currents will determine how efficient the ocean is at taking up the excess heat humans are producing, she said. And, for example, if the overturning current in the Atlantic Ocean weakens, or even collapses, the consequences could be dire – including very cold winters in Western Europe, rapid sea level rise and disruption to tropical monsoons.
For now, ocean surface temperatures have started to fall, even if they remain high for this time of year.
As scientists continue to analyze the reasons for record ocean warming, they are clear records will continue to be smashed as the climate crisis intensifies.
“This is a bit of a wake-up call, I hope, for everybody globally that this trajectory of warming that we’re on is not going to stop until we bring our emissions right back down to zero,” England said."
"COP28 president says fossil fuels still have a role to play, prompting concerns about climate summit’s goals",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/03/world/berlin-climate-conference-cop28-fossil-fuels-intl/index.html,"COP28 president says fossil fuels still have a role to play, prompting concerns about climate summit’s goals
The president of the UN’s COP28 climate conference has said that he sees a future for fossil fuels – even as scientists say the world must rapidly transition to clean energy – in remarks that have raised concerns about a backsliding on climate commitments.
Sultan Al Jaber, who will oversee the UN’s COP28 climate summit in Dubai in November, called for a focus on technologies to capture the planet-heating pollution produced by coal, oil and gas.
“We know that fossil fuels will continue to play a role in the foreseeable future in helping meet global energy requirements,” said Al Jaber, speaking on Wednesday at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, a conference attended by representatives from around 40 countries to help set the agenda for COP28.
He said that the world needed “to come to terms with some realities” and embrace an energy transition that includes “all sources of energy.”
“Our aim should be focused on ensuring that we phase out emissions from all sectors,” added Al Jaber.
It’s a departure from what other countries have called for. In March, European countries agreed to promote a global phase-out of fossil fuels in a text setting out their priorities for COP28.
“The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels,” the text said.
More than 80 countries supported a commitment to phase out oil, coal and gas at COP27 in Egypt last year, but Saudi Arabia and other oil and gas producing nations opposed it.
Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network, an alliance of environmental groups, told CNN that it was “concerning” that Al Jaber was speaking about a “‘foreseeable future for fossil fuels’ and a ‘phase out of emissions.’”
“A plan to end the era of fossil fuels should be central to the discussions and outcomes from COP28,” she said.
Nils Bartsch, head of oil and gas research at the German non-profit Urgewald, told CNN the world faces “an absolute carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius. Reducing emissions intensity of oil and gas production does not change that – it just helps to exhaust our budget a little slower.”
Scientists have said that the world should make every effort to stay under 1.5 degrees of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and nations have been working to keep that goal within reach at the annual climate summits.
Al Jaber emphasized the role of technologies like carbon capture in reducing planet-heating pollution. However, some experts are concerned that these technologies remain prohibitively expensive, are unproven at scale and would take too long to implement, given the urgency of the climate crisis.
“We cannot pretend the solutions to the climate crisis lie with unreliable, untested techno fixes that will bring new risks and threats,” Essop told CNN.
Al Jaber was a controversial pick to oversee COP28. He is also CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers.
Some, however, welcomed Al Jaber’s appointment. US climate envoy John Kerry told Associated Press that he was “a terrific choice,” citing his commitment to expanding renewable energy.
Al Jaber used the Berlin conference to set out priorities, including tripling renewable energy by 2030, doubling hydrogen production, expanding nuclear power and improving battery storage.
He also called on rich countries to deliver on their funding promises to climate-vulnerable countries. In 2009, wealthy nations pledged to mobilize $100 billion in annual climate funding, but they have consistently fallen far short of that target.
Al Jaber said this failure to deliver is hindering progress and undermining trust. He asked countries to “supercharge” climate finance.
“What I hear time and again is that climate finance is simply not available, not accessible, and not affordable,” Al Jaber said in Berlin on Tuesday. “If the world doesn’t come up with effective mechanisms to deliver climate finance to developing and emerging economies, they will have no choice but to choose a carbon-intensive development path.”
This year’s COP28 is considered particularly significant because it will include the first “global stocktake,” which will evaluate countries’ progress towards climate targets.
“All indicators… are telling us that we are way off track,” said Al Jaber.
Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, also speaking at the Berlin conference on Wednesday, said it will be important that “we actually take stock of what we have achieved and the targets we set ourselves. We have to get out of fossil fuels, we have to dramatically reduce emissions.”
“it is no longer about visions. It is finally about delivering on the pledges we made,” she said.

Standing in his field of stunted, withered maize, Santi Caudevilla is very worried. “If the weather does not change it will be zero. Nothing is going to be harvested,” he said.
Caudevilla, who grows maize, sorghum and other crops in Gimenells in Catalonia, has been hit hard by the severe drought which has hammered this part of northeastern Spain.
Rainfall has been low for years. “We are in a desert. This is a desert today,” he said.
The lack of water is starting to feel like an existential crisis for farmers such as Caudevilla and he is worried about the future of his profession. It’s becoming increasingly hard to make ends meet as crops shrivel through lack of water – or cannot be planted at all.
Droughts are a fact of life in this corner of Spain. “They are typical of Catalonia’s Mediterranean climate,” said Albert Ruhi, a freshwater ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is originally from Catalonia.
But a significant lack of rain and snow have made this one much, much drier, he told CNN.
“This is the worst period that we have had for the last 100 years,” Samuel Reyes, director of the Catalan Water Agency, told CNN.
The problem spreads beyond Catalonia.
Spain has been in a long-term drought since the end of 2022, said Ricardo Torrijo, a spokesperson for AEMET, the Spanish national weather service.
In March, the country only received 36% of the average monthly rainfall, making it the second driest March this century. The trend continued into April, which could end up being the driest on record, Torrijo told CNN.
Drought conditions have been exacerbated by searing temperatures that are more reminiscent of mid-July than spring.
Last Thursday, April records were smashed, with the city of Córdoba in southern Spain reaching 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit).
The combination of drought and heat have stoked fears for a repeat of last summer where the country saw blistering heat waves and wildfires that burned through 306,000 hectares (756,000 acres). Unusually early wildfires this spring have already burned more than 10,000 acres in the eastern region of Castellon.
These conditions point to a new reality for parts of Europe, which is warming twice as fast as the global average. While it will take time to pin down the exact role climate change is playing, scientists are clear that human-caused global heating is making droughts and heat waves more common and more extreme.
‘An agricultural disaster’
The cracked, desiccated earth at the Sau Reservoir reveals the heavy toll the lack of rainfall has taken on Catalonia’s water sources.
Located about 60 miles north of Barcelona, the reservoir is a key drinking water source for the region, but in late April it was only at 7% of capacity.
Its water levels are so low that a medieval village, flooded when the lake was created in the 1960s, has emerged, lending an eerie presence to the sun-baked lakebed.
Authorities have been forced to siphon out water from the reservoir in an attempt to protect water quality and have had to remove native fish to stop them asphyxiating.
Reservoir levels across Catalonia are hovering at around 25%, substantially lower than usual for this time of year.
The lack of water is having a catastrophic impact on farms across the region. “There is no precedent,” said Martí Costal, head of water at the Young Farmers and Ranchers of Catalonia (JARC).
The majority of wheat and barley harvests on rainfed land will be lost, and on irrigated land will be cut by half, Costal told CNN. “If it does not rain in May it will be a disaster,” he said.
It’s a story which tracks across the country’s agricultural heartlands.
Drought affects 60% of Spain’s countryside, and has destroyed crops across 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres), according to the Coordinator of Farmers’ and Ranchers’ Organizations (COAG). That’s an area bigger than the state of Maryland.
Livestock farming is at risk as farmers need pasture to feed their animals. Without it, they are forced to buy food. Losses are also expected for orchards, vineyards, olive oil production and vegetable farming, Serge Zaka, an agrometeorologist, told CNN.
“These agro-climatic conditions are leading to an agricultural disaster,” he said.
A lack of vegetation is also preventing bees from making honey. Beekeepers are facing a third consecutive season without a harvest thanks to water shortages, according to COAG.
In April, Spain requested emergency funding from the European Union to help farmers cope with the impacts of the drought.
‘There is no water’
Water scarcity is not just affecting farmers, but also drinking water.
The village of Castellcir, around 30 miles north of Barcelona, is one of many in Catalonia that have been relying on water brought in on trucks.
People have been asked to save water by having quick showers, being careful when washing dishes and not filling their pools.
The situation has been going on for more than a year, said Juan Cogdony, a resident of the village. “We are very worried,” he told CNN.
It just won’t rain, Cogdony said, looking up at the sky. “There is no water. Beer, yes, but no water,” he joked.
As the summer approaches, and the hope of heavy spring rains fade, many are sounding the alarm on what might be in store for Spain.
“We are now in a very dramatic situation,” said Joan Girona Gomis, a scientist at the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology, a research organization owned by the Catalonian government.
Without significant rain “we will suffer a bad drought this summer,” he told CNN.
Gomis has been working on experiments to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems used by farmers, including by using technology such as sensors to evaluate the precise amount of water crops need.
Whether Catalonia can remain one of Europe’s key farming regions is “the big question,” Gomis said. It all depends on “if we are able to adapt.”
It will mean big changes, Costal said, including researching drought-resistant crops, investment in urban and agricultural infrastructure and improvements in water efficiency.
He hopes what’s happening in Spain and other parts of Europe will remind people where their food comes from. “The fruits are produced in the field, not on the shelves of a supermarket,” he said.
In Gimenells, Caudevilla is deeply worried about what will happen to the Catalonian countryside if, as expected, droughts and heat waves become more frequent and more intense.
“This area is facing abandonment,” he said. Farmers are aging, he added, “in 10 years nobody will want to work in this countryside.”

More green investment hasn’t softened red resistance on climate,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/green-investment-red-states-climate-crisis-fault-lines/index.html,"More green investment hasn’t softened red resistance on climate
Even as billions of dollars in new clean energy investments surge into Republican leaning communities around the country, state and federal GOP officials are hardening their resistance to efforts to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels.
That stark contrast has dashed a central hope and expectation among environmentalists: the belief that more economic opportunity in red places would mean less political opposition from Republicans to the transition toward a clean energy economy that scientists say is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic global climate change. The persistence of GOP opposition to that transition underscores the limits of economic incentives to overcome ideological inclinations – and points toward years of pitched partisan conflict that could make it virtually impossible for the US to set a consistent course on climate policy.
This dynamic was encapsulated last week when virtually every House Republican voted, in the party’s debt ceiling plan, to repeal the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed last year, even though those incentives have already triggered investments in 72 Republican-held districts, including over two dozen districts that have received massive investments of $1 billion or more in new plants or expansions of existing facilities. It’s also apparent in decisions by Republican state attorneys general from states that are among the top beneficiaries of new clean energy investments and jobs to launch a flurry of lawsuits and other legal proceedings against proposals from President Joe Biden’s administration to speed the transition toward a low-carbon economy.
This opposition contravenes the traditional assumption that politicians almost always support the economic interests creating opportunity for their constituents. With growing boldness, Republicans and conservative activists are framing defense of fossil fuels and skepticism of clean energy alternatives as a form of culture war – with the transition to wind, solar and electric vehicles taking its place alongside transgender rights, “woke” indoctrination in the classroom or restrictions on gun ownership as an example of “coastal elites” trying to erase traditional American values.
In opposing measures to promote clean energy even in places benefiting from new investments to produce it, “Republicans believe – and the next election will help us see whether this is a good strategy or not – that culture war is going to be better to help them win than talking about jobs and the economy,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University.
In all these ways, climate change has become another fissure along the central fault line in modern American politics. Like attitudes toward demographic and cultural change, perspectives on shifting the nation’s energy mix from its historic reliance on fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives now pit the Democratic “coalition of transformation” that largely embraces the way America is changing on every front against the Republican “coalition of restoration” that resists it.
For many Republicans, the Inflation Reduction Act’s sweeping provisions to encourage carbon-free energy sources aren’t “a bipartisan domestic energy agenda,” even though those incentives are channeling substantial jobs and investment to red places, said Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant and former White House energy adviser for President George W. Bush. “This is a left wing, coastal ‘let’s change the world by having the federal government intervene at a time of high inflation kind of thing.’ When a Republican member does the pros and cons, it’s not like they don’t see the pros, but they see a lot of cons.”
Republican-leaning states, as I’ve written, are generally more integrated into the existing fossil fuel economy than blue-leaning places. Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector per each dollar of economic activity, mostly states between the coasts that are either big producers of fossil fuels (Wyoming, West Virginia, Texas) or big consumers of it to power robust agricultural and manufacturing sectors (Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana). Biden in turn won 19 of the 21 states with the least emissions, most of them coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and California. Representation in the House and Senate, and control of state governments, follow these same tracks, with Republicans dominating the high-emitting states and Democrats dominating those with lower emissions. Oil and gas companies now routinely direct about four-fifths of their campaign contributions toward Republicans in Congress.
But the energy transition now underway is remaking this picture. Red places are among the clear winners in the emerging clean energy economy. Of the five states that produced the most wind-generated electricity in 2022, according to federal statistics, four are solidly red: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas; Illinois is the sole exception. Big solar generating states include Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – places where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship or both.
The Inflation Reduction Act that passed last year on a party line vote is further diffusing these opportunities, though no Republican legislators in either the House or the Senate voted for it.
Overall, as of March 31, companies have announced “191 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $242.81 billion in new investments,” according to a recent report by the environmental advocacy group Climate Power. Those investments are projected to create some 142,000 jobs, the group calculated. Of the 10 states that have received the most announced clean energy projects, the group found, only two are safely Democratic (New York and California.) The rest are either battleground states (Michigan, Arizona and Georgia) or Republican-leaning (Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee).
The red tilt on investment is similarly pronounced at the congressional district level. In another study, Climate Power found that over half of all the new clean energy projects announced since the bill’s passage have been located in Republican-held congressional districts. The Republican district projects account, stunningly, for nearly four-fifths of the total clean energy investments that have been announced. The group found that two dozen House Republicans hold seats where clean energy companies have committed to investments of $1 billion or more since the passage of the IRA. The district that has received the most investment is held by New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams (whose New York seat is the site of a massive plant that will manufacture semiconductors for EVs) and the district projected to receive the most jobs is held by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei (which has attracted four separate projects). A South Korean company is building a $2.5 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in the Georgia district of far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
Many reasons may explain why so much of the new clean energy investment has flowed into red places. Most important may be that Republican states and districts tilt more toward rural areas where space for large manufacturing facilities is easier to acquire. In those states, taxes are typically lower and state regulations more lenient as well. Some companies are also attracted to the non-union environment in most red states.
Whatever the motivation for the companies, environmentalists have hoped that channeling more economic benefits from the energy transition into red places would soften the opposition of Republicans toward deemphasizing fossil fuels. The model some cite is how the spread of defense contracts across virtually every congressional district maximizes support for the Pentagon budget.
Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, sees that precedent as critical to sustaining a long-term federal effort behind promoting clean energy. “What we need it to become is the defense authorization act, where every single congressional district has a piece of it – and it can’t be undone and we are set on this path of reaching our goals because of how diffuse it is,” she says.
But establishing those political roots, she acknowledges, will take time, and in the near term, the torrent of new investment has not diminished Republican resistance. If anything, as Biden leans into measures to accelerate the energy transition, Republicans are stiffening their opposition.
“The harder one side pushes, the harder the other way the other side wants to push back,” said Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative group that supports action on climate change.
Last week, almost every House Republican voted for the sweeping bill to raise the debt ceiling that included the repeal of the extensive incentives in the IRA for both producers and consumers to shift to clean energy sources. Earlier this year, every House and Senate Republican, under an act allowing Congress to challenge federal regulations, voted to overturn a Department of Labor rule that would allow pension fund managers to consider so-called ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) goals in making investment decisions – which is considered one important way to encourage more investment in green industries.
Biden vetoed that change, but a coalition of Republican state attorneys general are still seeking to block the regulation in court. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate, recently organized a coalition of 19 Republican governors to fight such ESG measures, which he derides as “woke capitalism.”
West Virginia’s Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has hinted that when the federal Environmental Protection Agency completes its proposed fuel economy regulations requiring a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, GOP AGs will sue to overturn that, too. No one would be surprised if such a coalition of Republican-controlled states sues as well to block the regulations the Biden EPA is developing to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (Such a coalition successfully sued to block former President Barack Obama’s regulations on the same topic.) And it seems inevitable that whenever the EPA completes both its fuel economy and power plant regulations that congressional Republicans will attempt to override them as well. From Republicans, predicts McNally, there will be “complete and total opposition on all fronts” to the coming Biden climate regulations. “It will be kitchen sink – everything will be going at it.”
Reams is cautiously optimistic that if Republicans obtained unified control of the White House and Congress in 2025, they would preserve at least some of the IRA’s clean energy incentives as part of an “all of the above” strategy to encourage more domestic production of both fossil fuels and low-carbon sources. But McNally, in a view shared from across the political spectrum by Lodes, predicts that if Republicans win unified control, they will “gut” the IRA clean energy incentives that they voted to eliminate last week. “Ninety-eight percent of this is going to go,” he says.
When I reached out to several House Republicans last week to ask why they voted to rescind the IRA incentives although their districts have received big clean energy investments, most either did not respond or refused to comment. (In the latter camp was Utah Rep. John Curtis, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus and whose district has received $11 billion in clean energy investments, according to Climate Power.)
One who did respond was Amodei, the Nevada Republican. He exemplifies the depth of Republican skepticism to the Democratic agenda to combat climate change. His northern Nevada district contains not only a massive (and expanding) Tesla plant, but also a factory being built by another battery company, Redwood Materials. Between them, the Redwood plant and Tesla expansion are expected to create 4,600 permanent manufacturing jobs as well as many construction jobs, according to news accounts.
Yet Amodei voted last week to repeal all the IRA’s incentives to encourage more production and consumption of electric vehicles. In an interview, he said the pace at which Biden and Democrats want to transition transportation toward EVs was unrealistic. “Do I think electricity is the future? Absolutely,” Amodei said. But he added, “even with all these billions of dollars being poured into these things in the form of subsidies and penalties” the rate at which Biden hopes to shift Americans into electric vehicles “borders on suicidal.”
Moreover, he asserted that Nevada companies are largely being excluded from the construction jobs generated by the big plant expansions in his district, and that the bigger concern for most constituents he represents is the risk that the IRA’s increased spending will fuel inflation. “The benefits” of the bill, he says, “I don’t think outweigh the negative stuff in terms of debt, inflation and oh, by the way, how much really came to Nevada?”
Amodei is one of the Republican members that Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters have already targeted with ads criticizing their votes. Lodes says his claim that Nevada residents aren’t benefiting from the new jobs in his district “just doesn’t hold water.” She says the group’s challenge is to make clear to voters in the Republican districts benefiting from clean energy investments that their Representatives voted to repeal the incentives encouraging that spending. “The case we will have to make to voters is that every single one of these MAGA extremists put their agenda ahead of their constituents,” she says.
That argument could prove effective in some swing districts, particularly those with a large number of college-educated voters. But most House Republicans represent solidly GOP-leaning areas. And demand for action against climate change has remained minimal inside the GOP coalition. Leiserowitz says that in Yale’s polling, only a very small percentage of even moderate Republicans cite climate as an important issue for government to address and that the share of all Republicans who support developing more clean energy sources is actually dropping. Republican voters are far more likely to say they support more domestic drilling for oil and gas. The vast majority of Republican voters even say they will never consider buying an electric vehicle, according to a recent Gallup poll. Democrats mostly take the opposite positions, placing far greater priority on climate change as a problem and expressing much more interest in changing not only public policy but also their personal behavior to combat it.
Reams says that disparity has created a striking dynamic, with Republican-leaning communities producing the clean energy favored by Democratic-leaning consumers: “You have a phenomenon of red supply for blue demand,” she says.
Like many environmentalists to her left, Reams believes that as the clean energy industries become more “ingrained” in GOP-leaning areas, “more Republicans will say ‘I can’t repeal that.’” The historical behavior of members of Congress says she’s right; but those precedents may no longer apply.
Over time, more clean energy investments and jobs in Republican-leaning places should make the case for transition more compelling. Likewise, even in those red areas, more consumers may also experience benefits from renewable power sources or the cost savings of operating electric vehicles. “Clean energy, electric vehicles, all the things associated with these things are going to become part of normal life in America,” says Leiserowitz. The result is that people “will ask, ‘How can you be against something when everybody is doing it?’”
But all these traditional dynamics could be offset if clean energy continues to get pulled into the right’s culture war case against “woke” elites. Across a panoramic range of issues – from abortion, LGBTQ rights and guns to classroom censorship and book bans – Republicans, especially in red states, are looking to impose the cultural values of their predominantly conservative electoral coalition against what they consider liberal efforts to uproot the US from its traditions. So long as Republican voters are convinced to see the clean energy transition as part of that threat, even gleaming new factories and fat new paychecks may not much soften the party’s sweeping resistance to climate action."
Life in the ocean’s ‘twilight zone’ could disappear due to the climate crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/world/twilight-zone-life-reduction-climate-scn/index.html,"Life in the ocean’s ‘twilight zone’ could disappear due to the climate crisis

One of Earth’s largest habitats could see its rich diversity of life reduced by the end of the century due to the climate crisis.
The ocean’s mesopelagic zone, also called the “twilight zone,” is located between 656 feet and 3,280 feet (200 meters to 1,000 meters) below the surface.
The marine region, which accounts for approximately a quarter of the ocean’s volume, is home to billions of metric tons of organic matter and some of Earth’s most stunning biodiversity, despite being beyond the reach of sunlight.
The twilight zone also a crucial habitat for marine life that dives in search of prey, like sharks, or lanternfish that hide in the twilight zone during the day and swim to the surface waters to feed at night.
New research warns that the climate crisis could reduce life in the twilight zone between 20% and 40% by the end of the century. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue, the researchers estimate that the ocean region’s life could be severely depleted within 150 years — and recovery may not be possible for thousands of years.
Ancient warm oceans
Paleontologists and ocean scientists teamed up to study the impacts on the ocean’s twilight zone during previous ancient warming events in order to predict how the habitat may respond in the future due to global warming. The research team studied cores taken from the seafloor that included evidence of preserved microscopic shells from plankton.
Over time, the calcium carbonate shells accumulate on the seafloor, preserving information about what the environment was like during their lifetime. The tiny shells effectively create a timeline of how the ocean has changed over millions of years.
A study detailing the findings was published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications.
“We still know relatively little about the ocean twilight zone, but using evidence from the past we can understand what may happen in the future,” said lead study author Dr. Katherine Crichton, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in a statement.
The researchers focused on two warm periods that occurred 15 million years ago and 50 million years ago, where even ocean temperatures were “markedly warmer than today,” according to the study.
“We found that the twilight zone was not always a rich habitat full of life,” said study coauthor Paul Pearson, an honorary professor at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom, in a statement. “In these warm periods, far fewer organisms lived in the twilight zone, because much less food arrived from surface waters.”
Particles of organic matter from the ocean’s surface drift down and serve as one of the main food sources for life in the twilight zone. But past warming events caused the material to be degraded more quickly by bacteria, so less of it reached the ocean region.
Warmer ocean temperatures also increase the metabolic rates of organisms, leading to increased food demand and oxygen consumption, according to the study.
“The rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer, and improving conditions allowing life to thrive,” Crichton said.
Luiz A. Rocha, curator and Follett Chair of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, worries that changes are underway that haven’t been detected because the twilight zone is so understudied, largely due to a disconnect between funding and the costs of exploring this region.
Rocha, who was not involved in the study, researches the twilight zone and the mesophotic zone just above it, located between 98 and 492 feet (30 and 150 meters) below the surface.
“There are no baseline data to compare what we are measuring against, so this study that looks at the composition of the fossil record over time is one of the few ways we can try to understand how we are causing the twilight zone to change,” Rocha said.
Predicting the future
Based on what they discovered from the ancient warming events, the researchers combined that data with Earth system mode simulations — modeling of Earth’s carbon cycle as it moves through the land, sea and atmosphere.
The team’s work revealed what is currently occurring in the twilight zone and how that might change in the future across decades, centuries and even millennia as the world warms.
“Our findings suggest that significant changes may already be under way,” Crichton said. “Unless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter. Even a low-emissions future may have a significant impact, but that would be far less severe than medium- and high-emissions scenarios. Our study is a first step to finding out how vulnerable this ocean habitat may be to climate warming.”
The researchers used three emissions scenarios based on the total carbon dioxide emissions after 2010.
The low estimate was 625 billion metric tons, medium was 2,500 billion metric tons and high was 5,000 billion metric tons.
The Global Carbon Budget estimates that the total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2022 was 40.6 billion metric tons. Yearly emissions have been close to that number each year since 2010, so the researchers noted that the low-estimate scenario they used has already been emitted.
The team thinks the medium emissions scenario will have been reached in about 50 years, and the high estimate in just over a century.
“The twilight zone plays an important role in the ocean’s carbon cycle because most of the carbon dioxide taken up by phytoplankton ends up there as their remains sink down from the surface ocean,” said study coauthor Jamie Wilson, a postdoctoral researcher at the UK’s University of Liverpool, in a statement.
INTERACTIVE: See what’s at risk of disappearing on Earth
“One of the challenges of predicting how this movement of carbon might change in the future is that there are many processes to disentangle in the modern ocean. By looking back at the twilight zone in past warm periods we can identify the most important processes and use those to predict the future. We found that this natural cycling of carbon is likely already changing and may be perturbed long into the future.”
The climate crisis has impacted Earth’s oceans in the form of pollution, warming, deoxygenation, acidification and overfishing, according to the study. These effects have caused conservationists to consider different protective efforts, such as restricting harmful activities in the oceans.
Protecting the twilight zone will be difficult since typical conservation efforts, such as preventing fishing or deep-sea mining, can’t apply there, Rocha said.
“A marine protected area for the (twilight zone) makes very little sense because the impacts that are affecting it are global in nature,” he said. “What we really need to protect the (twilight zone) is to stop, or at least slow down, the high rate of change that we are subjecting our planet’s climate to.”"
Drought-stricken Spain braces for exceptionally high temperatures expected to break April records,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/europe/spain-high-temperature-heat-climate-intl/index.html,"Drought-stricken Spain braces for exceptionally high temperatures expected to break April records
A mass of hot and dry air blowing north from Africa has led to “exceptionally high” temperatures that are more “typical of summer” this week in central and southern Spain, the national weather service AEMET reported.
Temperatures this week are expected to be 15 to 20 degrees Celsius above normal for this time of year, with a chance they could hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some places.
In large parts of Spain, temperatures have exceeded 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). On Thursday, they are expected to surpass 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Guadalquivir River valley, which includes the cities of Cordoba and Seville, according to the Spanish national weather service.
On Wednesday, Cordoba and Seville airports both surpassed 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit), shattering the previous records for April temperatures set in 1997, Spain’s national weather agency AEMET reported.
Nighttime temperatures are also forecast to remain high, not dipping below 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) in some places.
Schools in central and southern Spain are concerned about protecting students and staff from overheated classrooms that don’t have air conditioning, Spanish media reported. Some are considering shifting timetables to put outdoor exercise activities earlier in the school day.
The heat could increase risks of wildfires in the country, which has already seen unusually early fires burn more than 10,000 acres in the country’s eastern region of Castellon in late March.
The high temperatures come as a prolonged drought has gripped parts of southern Spain, as well as the northeast of the country, near Barcelona. Rainfall has been very low, with March levels just 36% compared with the monthly average rainfall, Spain’s Ministry of Ecological Transition reported.
The country has experienced 36 consecutive months of below-average rainfall, with reservoirs at only about half of their capacity, Reuters reported. In Catalonia, northeastern Spain, reservoir water levels are at about 25% and there are already some water restrictions in place.
The lack of water is having a severe impact on the country’s farmers.
“The situation for agriculture due to the drought is very worrisome across Spain but in the areas most affected, it could be called agonizing,” said UPA, the Union for Small Farmers and Ranchers.
“Even fruit and olive trees, which normally are more resistant to drought, are heavily affected, because there have been years of low precipitation and intense heat,” UPA said on its website.
The early extreme heat is expected to continue into the weekend, according to AEMET."
"Catastrophic drought that’s pushed millions into crisis made 100 times more likely by climate change, analysis finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/africa/drought-horn-of-africa-climate-change-intl/index.html,"Catastrophic drought that’s pushed millions into crisis made 100 times more likely by climate change, analysis finds
The unrelenting drought that has devastated the Horn of Africa and left more than 20 million people facing acute food insecurity would not have been possible without climate change, a new analysis has found.
Since October 2020, this part of East Africa, one of the world’s most impoverished regions, has been gripped by its worst drought in 40 years as an unprecedented five consecutive rainy seasons have failed.
The drought has brought catastrophic impacts to large areas of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia: Tens of thousands have died, crops have shriveled, livestock have starved and chronic hunger and water insecurity are widespread and growing.
In a world without human-caused climate change, this devastating drought would not have happened.
That’s the conclusion of a rapid attribution study released on Thursday by the World Weather Attribution initiative. The organization is made up of a team of international scientists who, in the immediate aftermath of extreme weather events, analyze data and climate models to establish what role climate change played.
In the Horn of Africa, they found that planet-heating pollution caused by burning fossil fuels has made the region’s ongoing agricultural drought 100 times more likely – and that’s a conservative estimate, they said.
Higher temperatures have significantly increased the amount of water evaporating from plants and soils, according to the study, causing crop losses, livestock death and water shortages.
The planet’s average temperature is now around 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels of the late 1800s. Without that warming, the region would not have experienced this severe agricultural drought, the report found.
The scientists also looked at whether climate change was to blame for the lack of rain, but concluded there was no overall impact.
The report found that while climate change makes low rainfall twice as likely during the region’s “long rains” season, which runs from March to May, it actually makes the “short rains,” between October and December, wetter.
The reason this wetter trend has been absent in the Horn of Africa over the last few years is because of the influence of La Niña, a natural climate phenomenon that brings dryer conditions to the region during the short rains period.
Human-caused global heating is making droughts across the world longer and more extreme. The blistering drought that affected the Northern Hemisphere last summer, including large parts of the US, Europe and China, was made 20 times more likely by the climate crisis, according to an October analysis from the the World Weather Attribution group.
Scientists say droughts will only become more severe if the world continues to burn fossil fuels.
Regions that are already vulnerable face the worst impacts. The climate change-fueled disaster in the Horn of Africa has brought devastation to a region already suffering from a slew of problems, including global price hikes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and deadly internal conflicts.
Much of the population are farmers that rely on rainfall for crops and livestock. They have been plunged even further into poverty as the rains failed. At least 8 million farm animals are estimated to have died during the drought.
“This has actually forced people to migrate to other regions in search of either water or pasture for their crops, or also just food for their families,” said Phoebe Wafubwa, an adviser at the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent in Kenya.
Around 1.7 million people in Ethiopia and Somalia have had to leave their homes because of the impacts of the drought, according to the report, and hunger levels are sky-high. More than 20 million people in the Horn of Africa have been pushed into crisis levels of food insecurity, or worse, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
In Somalia, which has been teetering on the edge of famine, more than 43,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the drought, half of whom were children under five years old.
“Almost half of country’s population is affected, over 3 million people are displaced,” Mamunur Rahman Malik, the Somalia representative for the World Health Organization, told CNN. “The country continues to pay the price of global warming and climate change,” he added.
“The findings of this study show that frequent multi-year droughts compounded with heat extremes, in the main rainy season, will severely impact food security and human health in the Horn of Africa as the climate continues to warm,” Joyce Kimutai, principal meteorologist and climate scientist at the Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement.
The region is seeing some relief during the current rainy season, although it has brought flash flooding to parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.
“The expectation is that the drought is coming to a close,” Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara, told CNN.
But it will be a very long road to recovery. The current rains are “not substantial enough” to see a significant improvement to food security, Kimutai explained on a call with reporters. And the region can expect more extreme dry conditions in the future.
As the world continues to warm, “we expect to see the combined effect of low precipitation with (high) temperatures causing really exceptional droughts in this part of the world,” she said."
These are the places most at risk from record-breaking heat waves as the planet warms,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/25/world/heatwaves-temperature-record-climate-intl/index.html,"These are the places most at risk from record-breaking heat waves as the planet warms
Dangerous, record-breaking heat waves are set to increase as the climate crisis intensifies, and they will be particularly devastating in countries and regions that are least prepared for them, according to a new study.
Scientists analyzed temperature data sets spanning more than 60 years, as well as climate models, to calculate the likelihood of unprecedented heat extremes occurring – and where these might happen.
They identified Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Central America – including Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua – as “hot spots” for high-risk heat waves.
These regions are particularly vulnerable due to their fast-growing populations and limited access to healthcare and energy supplies, which undermine their resilience to extreme temperatures, according to the report, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.
“There’s evidence there that those regions may well be in for a big heat wave and they wouldn’t be prepared for it,” said Dann Mitchell, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK and a study co-author.
The threat facing Afghanistan is particularly stark, Mitchell told CNN. Not only is there high potential for record-breaking extreme heat, but the impacts will be intensified by the huge difficulties the country already faces, he said.
Afghanistan is struggling with dire social and economic problems. It also has a growing population which is increasingly exposed to the problems of limited resources, according to the report.
“When a really extreme heat wave does finally come along, then there are instantly going to be a lot of problems,” Mitchell said.
Heat waves have a wide-ranging negative impact. They reduce air quality, worsen drought, increase the risk of wildfires and can lead infrastructure to buckle.
They also take a heavy toll on human health, and extreme heat is one of the deadliest natural disasters. Heat stroke or heat exhaustion can trigger a wide range of dangerous symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea and loss of consciousness, among others. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, causing body temperature to skyrocket in a matter of minutes, and can lead to permanent disability or death.
Several regions have already seen unprecedented temperatures this year. In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, above normal, while high temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April.
“Heat waves and other extreme weather events will only become more intense as the world continues to burn fossil fuels,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, who was not involved with the study.
Nowhere is safe, noted the report, which found that “statistically implausible” heat waves – those that fell well outside the historical norm – occurred between 1959 and 2021 in around 30% of the regions assessed. These include the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, where high temperature records were not just broken but completely smashed, killing hundreds of people.
In Lytton, British Columbia, temperatures peaked at just under 50 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit) in June 2021, breaking the previous record by almost 5 degrees. The village was almost completely destroyed by a wildfire just days later.
Scientists determined that the event would have been almost impossible without climate change.
Parts of China, including Beijing, and European countries, such as Germany and Belgium, also face a high risk, according to the report.
The millions of people who live in these densely populated regions could be badly affected by heat waves, even if these countries are more likely to have resources to mitigate some of the worst impacts.
The report calls on governments around the world to prepare for heat events that go far beyond current record temperatures, such as setting up cooling centers and reducing hours for those working outside.
Many policies exist that governments can implement to save lives, Otto said, including “preparing heat wave management plans, ensuring and testing they are implemented, informing the public about imminent heat waves, and protecting people who are vulnerable to the impacts of heat waves.”
Unprecedented heat events are becoming more likely as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, said Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, a research fellow at Harvard University, whose 2022 research found that dangerous levels of heat are set to at least triple across the world by the end of the century.
“By definition, we don’t know what could happen if large populations are exposed to unprecedented heat and humidity stress,” Vargas Zeppetello told CNN, “but heat waves in the past few decades have already been extremely deadly and there is serious cause for concern in the future.”"
The Biden administration eyes a relatively untapped climate solution to revolutionize how homes are heated and cooled,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/25/politics/geothermal-home-heating-cooling-doe-climate/index.html,"The Biden administration eyes a relatively untapped climate solution to revolutionize how homes are heated and cooled
The Biden administration is rethinking how homes are heated and cooled in the US, eyeing a tried-and-true, but thus far underutilized, climate solution to reduce planet-warming pollution and save homeowners money on energy costs.
To do it, the Department of Energy is tapping 11 communities around the US to spend the next year designing projects to harness below-ground, geothermal energy to heat and cool homes, libraries, community centers and other buildings.
On Tuesday, DOE will announce that the communities – which range in size from New York City to Nome, Alaska – have received the first round of funding to help them reimagine how our homes stay comfortable. Geothermal heating and cooling could eventually be brought into homes and buildings using heat pumps, which are highly efficient appliances that circulate warm or cool air through buildings, according to the department.
“That heat pump is basically run from heat in the ground,” Arlene Anderson, project manager for DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office, told CNN. “The fuel is basically the Earth source heat.”
It’s part of a multi-year, $13 million project to explore how geothermal heating and cooling could be applied not only in rural areas but densely populated cities. After their year-long design phase, DOE will select a smaller number of these projects to fully fund and deploy. Details of the project were shared first with CNN.
In the long run, the effort could help communities transition away from heating and cooling with energy from planet-warming fossil fuels. Residential energy use accounts for around 20% of the country’s climate emissions, and a large portion of that is from energy used to heat and cool homes.
DOE’s announcement comes as the administration aims to make good on President Joe Biden’s promise to slash US carbon pollution in half by 2030. To get there, it’s looking to significantly increase wind energy and ramp up the adoption of electric vehicles. The administration is also expected to announce soon an aggressive new power plant rule that could dramatically reduce emissions from both coal and natural gas fired power plants.
And the administration has found the climate potential of geothermal energy is huge. So far, it has only been used on a much smaller scale than other clean technologies like solar and wind. But a recent DOE report found geothermal energy for heating and cooling could reach 90 gigawatts by 2050, which would cut around 1 billion metric tons of planet-warming emissions – roughly the same amount as taking 20 million cars off the road per year.
US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the technology “will expand the uses of clean energy in decarbonizing our communities,” and added that geothermal heating and cooling “can go a long way in decarbonizing the building and electricity sectors.”
How geothermal could be used to heat and cool your home
Geothermal technology can be used for two things: to produce electricity or to generate heat and warmth. This project will focus on the latter.
To start the process, geothermal wells are drilled into the Earth – similar to a water well. The wells are outfitted with pipes which are installed in a closed loop so that water can circulate through them. That water is warmed up by the below-ground heat, and the warm water can then be used to power super-efficient heat pumps that push heat into or out of a building, depending on the season.
Some individual houses currently use geothermal heating and cooling systems like this, Anderson told CNN, but it’s much rarer in the US to have systems that can power entire neighborhoods.
There are 23 known communities that are using geothermal to heat and cool their buildings, according to the DOE. The best-known example of this, it says, is in Boise, where water warmed via geothermal energy is used to heat more than 6 million square feet of building space, according to the city’s website.
Still, the US is behind the ball on the technology.
“These are fairly common in Europe where geothermal is used in a district system, but not so much in the US,” Anderson said. “There’s a lot of competition from other energy sources, mostly oil, gas and coal. There’s also a lack of knowledge about this technology in the US even though it’s been around for a long time.”
DOE’s goal is to eventually have a quarter of each of the selected communities’ overall heating and cooling be supplied by geothermal, Anderson said. And part of the goal of the first design phase is to see how well it can work in different communities of varying sizes and locations around the country.
For instance, neighborhoods in two of America’s largest cities – New York City and Chicago – are planning to demonstrate how they can use geothermal to power hundreds of apartments and residential buildings. Duluth, Minnesota, which has a much colder climate, is planning to use a geothermal system that’s powered by wasted heat from their wastewater treatment plant, while the remote community of Nome, Alaska, wants to use the technology to help keep cool food storage areas, in addition to heating residential buildings.
Anderson said DOE will spend the next month negotiating on funding for the design phase with each community. Once that is settled, the communities will each have a year to design their projects, including coming up with engineering designs that are “good enough to obtain permits,” according to Anderson. After that, DOE will move forward with a final selection process on a smaller number of projects.
“We’re looking at a lot of different configurations, whether it’s rural, remote, or urban,” Anderson said. “It’s new for us; it’s exciting.”"
"Fact check: Trump’s latest false climate figure is off by more than 1,000 times",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/fact-check-trump-sea-levels-ocean-climate-change/index.html,"Fact check: Trump’s latest false climate figure is off by more than 1,000 times
Former President Donald Trump keeps using wildly inaccurate figures to minimize the threat of climate change.
Trump, now a presidential candidate, has argued in speeches and interviews that the risk of nuclear war is a much more important issue than climate change. He is entitled to his opinion. But he has repeatedly defended that opinion by citing imaginary statistics on the extent to which sea levels are expected to rise in the future.
In a Fox interview this month, Trump echoed a claim he made in his campaign launch speech in November. He said on Fox: “When I listen to people talk about global warming, that the ocean will rise, in the next 300 years, by 1/8th of an inch – and they talk about, ‘This is our problem.’ Our big problem is nuclear warming, but nobody even talks about it. The environmentalists talk about all this nonsense.”
In a podcast interview that aired last week, Trump used a figure even smaller than 1/8th of an inch over 300 years: “When I see these people talking about global warming, where the ocean will rise by 1/100th of an inch over the next 350 years…”
Facts First: Trump’s claims about sea levels are not remotely close to accurate. As the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has noted, the global sea level is currently rising at about 1/8th of an inch per year. In other words, the sea level rise Trump claimed people say will happen over 300 years is actually happening annually. NOAA says that, along the United States coastline in particular, sea level rise is expected to average a total of 10 to 12 inches between 2020 and 2050 alone.
That means NOAA expects an average increase in the US sea level that is 80 to 96 times bigger, over just 30 years, than the “1/8th of an inch” increase Trump suggested has been projected over 300 years. And NOAA’s estimate for US sea level rise over those 30 years is 1,000 to 1,200 times bigger than the “1/100th of an inch” figure Trump cited on the podcast last week for the next 350 years.
Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea level rise, said in an email on Friday that Trump’s claims “can only be described as totally out of touch with reality…simply untrue.” He said Trump “has no idea what he is talking about.”
Mar-a-Lago is expected to face a much bigger sea level increase
Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast – and Florida, which is bordered by both coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states. Trump’s claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for his own home in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago resort on the Atlantic.
Even in an optimistic scenario where global warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, the sea level near Mar-a-Lago is expected to rise nearly 3 feet by 2150 relative to 1995-2014 levels, according to a NASA projection tool that incorporates the latest climate science. That’s a projected increase of more than 3,500 times Trump’s “1/100th of an inch” figure, and in about half the time period – roughly 150 years versus Trump’s 300 years.
Sea levels could rise much faster with more warming. Under a scenario with high emissions and a rapid collapse of ice sheets, NOAA says the contiguous US could see a sea level increase of 7.2 feet over 2000 levels by 2100 and an increase of 13 feet over 2000 levels by 2150.
Serious consequences
Trump has for years dishonestly dismissed the existence and impact of climate change. In a speech at a conservative conference last year, after saying that “the oceans may rise, over the next 300 years, 1/100th of an inch,” he joked, “Giving you slightly more seafront property.”
In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland – rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive, and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems."

Last week, Germany closed its last three nuclear power plants, becoming nuclear free for the first time in 62 years. While such decisions are rightfully the responsibility of the government and electorate in Germany, it seems to be a premature choice for a world facing a changing climate, driven by humanity’s ravenous consumption of carbon-based fossil fuels.
And Germany is not alone. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, many countries began phasing out nuclear power plants, citing issues of nuclear safety and long-term storage of nuclear waste. While these are valid concerns, let’s take a high-level look at energy and the potential role of nuclear power generation.
In any conversation about power, we must admit a few things. First is that our technological society requires power to thrive and the need for power is constantly growing. A second consideration is that power generated by burning fossil fuels is indelibly harming our environment. Carbon dioxide released from fossil fuels are heating the planet, with substantial ecological and geopolitical consequences. Taken together, these two facts suggest that humanity needs to find increasing sources of energy which emit a minimum amount of carbon.
In 1980, the annual worldwide energy production amounted to about 88,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) and it grew to 176,000 TWh in 2021, doubling in four decades. During those 40 years, the sources of energy have changed only modestly. Fossil fuels supplied 80% of the world’s energy in 1980. In 2021, it was 77%. Nuclear power grew from 2% to 4%. The remainder was generated using traditional biomass and renewable energy, like solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower.
Opinion: No, nuclear power isn’t the ‘big bazooka’ climate fix you might think
The story is not the same worldwide. For example, in Germany a substantial investment in renewables is showing significant returns. When one compares the 1990 annual German power generation to 2022, one sees a modest increase in energy usage: 550 TWh (1990) vs. 570 TWh (2022). However, the sources of energy have changed dramatically. If one compares the 1990 to 2022 percentages, one finds fossil (64% vs. 46%), nuclear (29% vs. 6%) and renewables (6% vs. 44%). The balance is from other sources.
Thus, we see that Germany is making significant strides towards a green future. The country is to be congratulated for taking the danger of climate change seriously.
However, we see that even as proactive a country as Germany still gets nearly half of their energy from fossil fuels, with nearly half of that carbon-based energy from burning lignite, a particularly inefficient form of fuel. While all fossil fuels release carbon dioxide when burned, when lignite is burned, it releases more carbon dioxide to get the same amount of energy than other fossil fuels do. And even if they hit their goal of 80% of their energy generated by renewables by 2030, that still leaves 20% using fossil fuels. Would not generating that power from carbon-free nuclear power plants be preferable?
‘A new era’: Germany quits nuclear power, closing its final three plants
Opponents of nuclear energy cite safety concerns and cost. By some measures, nuclear power is more expensive than other sources. However, cost comparisons can be tricky. Costs include more than the fuel and staff needed to generate energy. It includes costs to build the power plants and, in the case of carbon-based fuels, it should include the hidden cost of damages from increasingly violent storms caused by a heating planet.
In the US, the regulatory process involved in building a nuclear power plant is slow and obstructive. An American plant can take a decade or more to build, while a similar plant in Japan can take five years from starting construction to attaching the plant on the grid. The difference is mostly because of the much longer regulatory review in the US. This is made worse by the fact that American plants often differ from one another. Streamlining the process and adopting a common reactor design can shave construction costs. And, of course, nuclear power plants emit no carbon dioxide and even the carbon emissions necessary to mine the fuel are relatively modest.
Solar and wind power are excellent prospects for the future, and we should vigorously pursue them. However, the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. These green technologies require energy storage for a rainy day – literally. Nuclear power plants can run day and night, on breezy days and calm ones.
Nuclear power generation is not a panacea. It does come with risks. We need to solve the problem of storing nuclear waste. The Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada was a good option, but public outcry shut down the project. Experts agree that the best choice for storing nuclear waste is in an underground facility that is “geologically stable,” which means one not prone to earthquakes or change of any kind. The most radioactive waste decays quickly, although some decay more slowly. The threat is substantially reduced in 100 years, and even more so in 1,000. The Yucca Mountain repository was designed to last even longer.
America needs such a facility, and the government and nuclear industry should resume search for a suitable location to store the admittedly hazardous waste that is a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In addition, modern nuclear power plant designs generate less waste than earlier designs and further improvements should be pursued.
The one thing we know about humanity is that it will continue to grow, with an associated need for energy. Nuclear power generation should be an important component of humanity’s energy future."
"To my son, born in the climate crisis: I see signs of hope",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/23/us/climate-crisis-earth-day-weir-letter/index.html,"To my son, born in the climate crisis: I see signs of hope
Programming note: This is Bill Weir’s third letter for CNN to his young son. The first looked at the twin crises of Covid and climate change as River was born; the second introduced him to Earth Day and what he could do. Watch Weir investigate “How to Unscrew a Planet,” on CNN’s “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper,” Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.
Dear River,
You’ve only been around for three Earth Days, but your tiny lifetime has been a hell of a ride, kid.
As a member of Generation Alpha (Good name! Hopeful.) I like to think you’ll read these letters with intent as you turn 30 in 2050. By then, you’ll know what became of the American experiment in the Age of Unreason and how fast the weather became unrecognizable.
Since your last birthday, I watched the most expensive storm in Florida history upend lives down to the littlest, while out West, the hydrology has gone bonkers, with not enough water here and too much over there and no real plan on how to divvy it up among people who want lawns in the desert.
While the American electricity made by clean sources surpassed coal-fired power for the first time, a Russian-led ground war in Europe set up a world where Saudi oil company Aramco made the second-highest annual profit in the history of humanity, just behind (checks notes) Saudi Aramco.
If that’s not enough to make a new Old Dad stare in the middle distance, the nation of your birth has also been torn apart by $787,500,000 worth of lies without apology and conspiracy theories around every corner. The leading cause of childhood death is now a bullet – or usually several at once – and some nights, the only thought that brings me peace is that you are half-Canadian.
But one thing I’ve learned as the first Chief Climate Correspondent on American television, when your beat is a “hyperobject” – a phenomenon so vast it exceeds human comprehension – one of the upsides is that you can choose to squint at it from an infinite number of angles on any given day.
I spent the first couple years on this beat obsessing over the dark side of the human triptych in our real-life version of “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” while occasionally sneering at all the freaky human decadence causing our downfall in the middle – what Hieronymus Bosch called “Humankind Before the Flood.”
But my mental health improved when I decided to spend more time between disasters over in the panel of goodness and light. One wild penguin colony or sustainable neighborhood at a time, I’m trying to balance out the firehose of peer-reviewed dread by focusing less on Life As We Blew It and more on Life As We Know It Could Be.
Every week, I get pitched a world with airships hauling clean fuel instead of diesel tractor trailers, and sting ray-shaped robots that sink seaweed to bury carbon instead of factory-fishing trawlers that clear-cut the sea. Your buses could bring you to school on sunlight and then help power your classrooms after dark. The world’s most abundant fuel source might be hydrogen made from sun and sea water, or little nuclear fusion stars in boxes filling batteries made of salt or minerals mined on the Asteroid Psyche.
All this utopian stuff is technically feasible but, as I learned filming “How To Unscrew A Planet” for CNN’s “The Whole Story,” they must also be scalable, affordable and profitable, which means our fates will be decided as much by marketers and influencers as policy makers and engineers.
In a balloon over the Alps, legendary aeronaut Bertrand Piccard described how he found over 1,400 money-making, Earth-healing start-ups and tried to convince me that the answers are all around us, if only we can think like a balloonist and “change our altitude and attitude” by dropping the ballast of wasteful ideas and dirty fuels.
But we still need dirty fuels to build all this new stuff and in your third year on Earth, we were just starting to wrap our heads around the trillion-ton problem of moving generations-worth of excess carbon out of sea and sky and back into the rock and seabed where it came from.
“We have to build the oil industry in reverse!” Marty Odlin told me, sitting on a bucket on a dock in Maine as the fisherman/scientist gave me my metaphor for a show about planet-cooking CO2.
“It’s a Godzilla,” he said. “It’s burning forests down. It’s stealing our fish. It’s devastating our crops. It’s hurting our farmers. All the stuff that’s free and fun is getting ruined. We should get mad and go kill that thing. Right?”
Marty just wanted to be a fisherman growing up, but when he realized that the Gulf of Maine was too warm and acidic for his sons to ever consider the same, he started an ocean repair company to go hunting for Carbon Godzilla. Running Tide, which uses the natural carbon-sucking power of oysters and kelp, is among the finalists for the $100 million Carbon XPRIZE, funded by Elon Musk.
Back when there were just a few Teslas on the road, I went to interview Musk in his modest garage headquarters on a side street in San Carlos, California, and I still remember the snap in my neck the first time I punched the Roadster’s pedal. But who could have known this guy would go on to launch his car into space for the LOLs, supplant GM and Toyota in profits and cause reputable news organizations to flee Twitter?
Fifteen years later, I went back to that San Carlos street, and next door to Tesla’s old garage I met the founders of Ebb Carbon, another startup in the running for Musk’s $100 million Carbon XPRIZE.
Their Model A is a machine that fixes the chemistry of water coming out of desalination plants, making the ocean less acidic while accelerating its ability to lock away carbon as bicarbonate.
“That form of storage is stable for 10,000 years in the ocean,” Ebb’s CTO Matthew Eisamen told me. “And that’s a big reason for why we’re taking this approach is that’s basically the natural way the Earth regulates CO2.”
They say their machine can capture 100 tons of Carbon Godzilla a year, at a current cost of over $1,000 a ton. “We need to get to billions of tons per year,” Eisamen said. “And we anticipate that this will, at scale, be one of the lowest cost approaches, much less than the magic $100 per ton.”
But while Ebb just received $20 million in fresh investments, they are metaphorical toddlers at the starting line of a race to build a trillion dollar decarbonization industry in less time than it takes for an ice shelf collapse. And even if they somehow reach Tesla-like growth, science warns that the world will need hundreds of Ebbs to flourish in your lifetime to beat Carbon Godzilla.
Which is why, in your third year on Earth, more people began talking in earnest about figuring out a way to turn down the sun.
“We call it climate intervention,” Kelly Wanser told me as we sat under bluebird skies and the Washington Monument. Other people call it solar radiation management or geoengineering, and while the very idea touched off a fierce scientific debate, she left life as a systems expert in Silicon Valley to convince lawmakers and CEOs that humanity may be forced to mimic the cooling power of a volcano, so we should probably start studying the stratosphere now, just in case.
Ever since the ash of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption blew into the stratosphere and cooled the planet by half a degree Celsius for more than a year, scientists have wondered if the effect could be duplicated by aircraft spraying enough sulfur dioxide or dust made of chalk or even diamonds to cool the Earth by a degree or two.
At the University of Washington, they are trying to come up with an asthma inhaler the size of an airplane to mist seawater over land and sea to advance the field of marine cloud brightening. If properly scaled, the thinking goes that you could cool the Gulf of Mexico before hurricane season, or shade the Great Barrier Reef long enough to grow stronger coral. In the United Arab Emirates, they are even using drone-borne lasers to bring rain to the desert.
But the reality is that we have no idea what works in the stratosphere, because we understand so little about the part of the sky twice as high up as our flights to Grandma’s. Chinese spy balloon scandals don’t help.
“A lot more has been invested in the technology for helping determine like what shoes you want to buy than what the climate system is going to do,” Wanser said.
In February, NOAA launched their first SABRE mission and sent pilots in space suits up to 60,000 feet above Alaska to take the first measurements of the stratosphere in decades. Their new tools will be a rare first glimpse into how the debris from wildfires, volcanoes and rocket exhaust is slowing, speeding or masking the rate of global warming.
River, your great grandparents were alive from the Wright Brothers to the Space Shuttle, but as the Earth unravels and artificial intelligence rises faster than our imaginations, their 20th century rate of changes-per-lifetime will seem as quaint as the butter churn. So far, it feels like your future will be marked in new stories to frame our wants and needs, and new tools to build Life As We Know It Could Be.
How it goes will depend on the wisdom and intent of the people wielding them, and how fast we grow or shrink Carbon Godzilla.
Does this fill your Old Man with more wonder or worry?
Depends on the day."
The world just failed its annual health checkup,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/world/wmo-report-state-of-climate-intl/index.html,"The world just failed its annual health checkup
Droughts, floods and record low ice levels – from the top of the world’s mountains to the depths of the ocean, the climate crisis took a heavy toll as it continued to intensify in 2022, new analysis from the World Meteorological Organization shows.
The WMO’s annual State of the Climate Report, published Friday ahead of Earth Day, is essentially a health checkup for the world. It analyzes a series of global climate indicators – including levels of planet-heating pollution, sea level rise and ocean heat – to understand how the planet is responding to climate change and the impact it is having on people and nature.
The findings paint a stark picture. “2022 was a year of extremes for the planet – and this continues the trend set in previous years,” Omar Baddour, head of the Climate Monitoring and Policy Division at the WMO, told CNN.
A slew of climate records were broken, many of which have been, or are on course to be, broken again this year:
These broad climate indicators are an important reflection of the state of the planet, the report noted, but extreme weather events – fueled by climate change – are where the immediate effects are most felt.
“While greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, populations worldwide continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.
Last year, climate change-fueled extreme weather “affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage,” he said.
In 2022, China had its most extensive and long-lasting drought on record. Droughts also affected East Africa, with more than 20 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia facing acute food insecurity as of January this year.
Many western and southern US states experienced significant drought and Europe’s punishing heatwave is estimated to have led to 15,000 excess deaths.
In Pakistan, record-breaking rainfall left huge swaths of the country underwater, killing more than 1,700 people, with almost 8 million displaced, and causing $30 billion in damages.
The most vulnerable are the hardest hit, Baddour said. “Communities and countries which have contributed least to climate change suffer disproportionately.”
Last year is unlikely to be an outlier, as temperatures continue their upwards trajectory. The past eight years were the hottest on record, despite three consecutive years of the La Niña climate phenomenon, which has a global cooling effect.
The global average temperature last year climbed to about 1.15 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the report, as the world continues its march towards breaching 1.5 degrees of warming for the first time.
With the predicted arrival later in the year of El Niño, which brings warmer global temperatures, scientists are deeply concerned that 2023 and 2024 will continue to smash climate records.
The hottest year on record, 2016, was the result of a strong El Niño and climate change, said Baddour. “It is only a matter of time before that record is broken.”
The WMO report follows an analysis published Thursday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which focused on how climate change affected Europe last year.
It highlighted “alarming” changes to the continent’s climate, including the hottest summer ever recorded, unprecedented marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean sea and widespread wildfires.
“The droughts and level of heatwaves that we saw throughout 2022 were quite remarkable,” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, told CNN.
“This is really a wake up call that climate change isn’t a future problem, it is a current problem. And we need to adapt as quickly as possible,” she added."
"Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting rapidly and driving sea level rise, new satellite data finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/world/greenland-antarctic-ice-sheets-melt-climate-intl/index.html,"Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting rapidly and driving sea level rise, new satellite data finds
The Earth’s ice sheets lost enough ice over the last 30 years to create an ice cube 12 miles high, according to new research.
The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which hold almost all of the world’s freshwater ice, are shrinking at a frighteningly rapid pace, according to a report on Thursday from a team of international scientists.
Combining data from 50 satellite surveys of Antarctica and Greenland, spanning the years 1992 to 2020, scientists from the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, were able to track changes in the ice sheets’ volume and ice flow.
They found that ice sheet melting has increased six-fold over the past 30 years, as record levels of planet-heating pollution push up global temperatures.
The seven worst years for polar ice sheet melting all happened during the past decade.
In all, the polar ice sheets lost more than 8.3 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2020, according to the report.
The worst year for ice sheet loss was 2019, the report found, when the ice sheets lost around 675 billion tons of ice. These losses were driven by an Arctic heatwave, which saw Greenland’s ice sheet shed 489 billion tons.
The loss of ice is having a significant impact on the oceans, pushing up sea levels by 21 millimeters (just less than an inch), according to the report. Ice sheet melting now accounts for a quarter of all sea level rise – a fivefold increase since the 1990s.
“This is a huge amount of ice,” study lead author Inès Otosaka, a research fellow at the University of Leeds, told CNN. “This is very worrying, of course, because 40% of the global population lives in coastal areas,” she said.
Scientists found that the rate at which the Antarctic ice sheet is melting has slowed, but remains much faster than in the 1990s.
The report identified the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica  – the location of the troubled Thwaites Glacier, nicknamed the “Doomsday” glacier for its potentially devastating impact on sea level rise  – as the regions where most of the continent’s melt was happening.
Otosaka expects the Greenland ice sheet to continue losing ice, but said it’s not yet clear what might happen to the Antarctic ice sheet.
“In Antarctica we have higher uncertainty in the future,” she said.”We have what we call some low-probability but high-impact mechanisms that could be triggered if we exceed a certain level of warming.”
That could lead to a much higher sea level rise in the future, she added.
If the world hits certain warming thresholds, it could trigger important and potentially irreversible feedback mechanisms, Otosaka said.
“We really need to have strong governmental policies to limit future warming and to cut our greenhouse gas concentration,” she added.
The European Space Agency, which along with NASA helps fund IMBIE’s research, said in a statement: “It is without doubt that climate change is causing our polar ice sheets to melt, thereby driving up sea levels and putting coastal regions around the world at risk.”
Scientists at IMBIE plan to update the assessment every year.
“We are finally at the stage where we can continuously update our assessments of ice sheet mass balance as there are enough satellites in space monitoring them, which means that people can make use of our findings immediately,” Andrew Shepherd, a professor at Northumbria University and founder of IMBIE, said in a statement."
"Climate change is fueling deadly heat waves in India. It’s putting the country’s development at risk, study says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/asia/india-heat-wave-development-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Climate change is fueling deadly heat waves in India. It’s putting the country’s development at risk, study says
Deadly heat waves fueled by climate change are threatening India’s development and risk reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, a new study has found.
Heat waves have already critically impacted the country, leading to power outages, increased dust and air pollution, and accelerated glacial melt in the north of India, researchers from the University of Cambridge said in the study published in the journal PLOS Climate on Wednesday.
Since 1992, more than 24,000 people have died because of heat waves in India, the study said.
And the impacts are expected to get worse as heat waves become more frequent, intense and lethal due to the climate crisis.
“India is currently facing a collision of multiple cumulative climate hazards,” said the researchers.
“Long-term projections indicate that Indian heat waves could cross the survivability limit for a healthy human resting in the shade by 2050.”
The study shows that millions more people in India are vulnerable to climate change than first thought. More than 90% of the country could be severely impacted by heat waves, falling into an extreme heat “danger” zone, according to the heat index, the study found.
The heat index is how hot it feels and considers both air temperature and humidity to assess the heat’s impact on the population.
Last year, India experienced a searing heat wave, during which parts of the country reached more than 49°C (120°F).
In 2022, India experienced its hottest April in 122 years and its hottest March on record, the study said. And it experienced extreme weather on 242 out of 273 days between January and October 2022, the researchers found.
Such repeated heat stress will upend millions of lives and livelihoods.
“Estimates show a 15% decrease in outdoor working capacity … during daylight hours due to extreme heat by 2050,” the study found. “The increased heat is expected to cost India 2.8% and 8.7% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and depressed living standards by 2050 and 2100, respectively.”
By mid-century, 70 Indian cities are expected to have more than 1 million inhabitants, according to the study.
Extreme heat will pose a threat to the energy security and health of those people, and reverse progress in inequality and poverty reduction, the researchers found.
“My family in Kolkata is suffering from current heat waves leading to frequent load shedding,” said the author of the study, Dr Ramit Debnath, in a reference to enforced power outages that reduce strain on the grid. “The climate-energy nexus is becoming more relevant,” he added.
Typically, it’s the poorest and most vulnerable who will suffer the most.
Heat waves will “have unprecedented consequences on the low-income population” the study said. As an example, the authors point to the rapidly urbanizing capital New Delhi, which “has a high level of construction activities, mostly involving a low-income labor force, who are also at severe risk from heat wave impacts.”
While India has a “climate vulnerability index” through which it assesses its vulnerability to the climate crisis, the authors believe this underestimates how heat waves impact the country’s development.
India has committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, a list of 17 objectives that include cutting poverty, hunger, inequality and disease, as well as promoting health, education and sanitation.
By not understanding the true threat of heat waves on its population, India risks missing out on those goals.
The study’s co-author Professor Ronita Bardhan said the recommendations could be used to build heat resilience for low-income housing as “these communities are most vulnerable to heat impacts.”
“Heat-health packages for low-income and slum dwellers are specifically critical as we show heat waves have devastating impacts on urban sustainability,” she said.
Another practical application is urban greening strategies around highly dense areas, which “can provide relief from urban heat island effects,” Bardhan said.
The authors stress “urgency” in recommending India update its extreme weather assessment to include the heat index and its impact on India’s sustainable development.
“India has demonstrated tremendous leadership in scaling up heat action plans in the last five years by declaring heat waves a natural disaster and mobilizing appropriate relief resources,” the authors said.
But “as the heat waves in India and the Indian subcontinent become recurrent and long-lasting, it is high time that climate experts and policymakers reevaluate the metrics for assessing the country’s climate vulnerability.”"
"The oil and gas industry is emitting way more of this potent, planet-warming gas than the EPA has estimated, study shows",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/us/methane-oil-and-gas-epa-climate/index.html,"The oil and gas industry is emitting way more of this potent, planet-warming gas than the EPA has estimated, study shows
Planet-warming methane pollution from the US oil and gas industry was 70% higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s own estimates between 2010 and 2019, scientists reported Monday.
The new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the federal government’s current system for detecting methane leaks from fossil fuel pipes, wells and compressors is inadequate. Several recent studies have shown similar results, and scientists now say the EPA needs to leverage new technology to get a fuller picture of how much of this potent greenhouse gas is escaping into the atmosphere and hold companies accountable for the leaks.
Methane, the main component of natural gas and a byproduct of fossil fuel drilling, has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide in the first two decades it’s in the atmosphere. The oil and gas industry is the main source of global methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Levels have risen precipitously in recent years, and scientists are looking at the gas as a target to cut climate emissions quickly because it has such a powerful warming effect.
While researchers used data from satellite instruments to paint a picture of methane leaks across the US, oil and gas operators and the EPA often rely on engineering models and hand-held infrared equipment to track leaks, which experts say is inadequate.
“This has been known for a while, at least in the atmospheric science community,” said Daniel Jacob, one of the study’s lead authors and a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. “When we observe methane in the air, we find concentrations much higher than one would expect from the EPA inventories.”
In a statement, an EPA spokesperson noted that another recent study found that 2019 levels were on par with the agency’s estimates for that year.
“The EPA continues to work through its stakeholder process to review new data from [its] Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and research studies to assess how emissions estimates can be improved,” the spokesperson said.
Experts told CNN Monday’s study points to the need for the agency to adopt better monitoring practices, as technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last few years. New satellite instruments can monitor methane leaks with high accuracy from space, and there are emerging remote-sensing technologies that can help pinpoint leaks coming from specific locations.
“There really have been transformational advances in remote sensing technology for methane over the last decade and the last three to four years,” Riley Duren, CEO at nonprofit Carbon Mapper and a University of Arizona researcher, told CNN. “That reporting program doesn’t require operators to go out and fly airplanes. It’s largely based on models and standard emissions factors.”
A new way to find leaks
There’s no question the EPA is monitoring methane leaks from oil and gas operations, experts said. The problem is the scale of monitoring is too small and infrequent.
Existing EPA regulations require oil and gas companies to do quarterly inspections using hand-held infrared cameras and sensors to look for leaks coming from wells and equipment, and much of the rest is accounted for with engineering models.
The problem is this technique tends to miss a lot of leaked methane, experts said.
“A leak that goes on for some days and then gets fixed, or some operator venting gas at a particular time of day – if you’re just cruising around and trying to observe hotspots, you might miss them,” Jacob said.
Jacob and other atmospheric scientists say there should be more monitoring of methane from the air, which can catch a huge plume that has gone undetected for weeks or months. But that’s not the silver bullet for the problem either, since monitoring from the air isn’t as precise and can’t drill down to locate which specific faulty equipment or well is causing a leak.
This is leading to even further advancements in technology in which satellites can monitor leaks with more precision to figure out exactly where it is coming from. That technology is going to be used more starting this year, according to Duren.
“We’re going to see more of that,” Duren said. “We need to get to a place where measurements are happening on a daily or hourly basis.”
And the EPA is also in the process of writing new methane regulations as President Joe Biden has made cutting methane a key part of his climate agenda. Democrats’ climate law that passed last summer also included funding for a more robust methane program that, by next year, would require companies leaking methane above a certain threshold to pay a fine if they don’t fix the problem. EPA could in the future also rely more on third-party data from researchers like those at Harvard to help identify hot spots.
“Detecting methane is really hard,” said Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program. “That bottom-up assessment should be better and (EPA’s) trying to make it better. Now these technologies have evolved so fast to say ‘goodness, we’re way off.’”
Oil and gas companies also have a financial incentive to capture more methane; they are losing money when they allow gas that could be sold to leak into the atmosphere. Duren said that as Carbon Mapper has informed companies or state regulators about methane plumes they’ve discovered, companies have voluntarily fixed the leaks themselves.
“The combination of that forward-looking mindset from operators as well as the new regulations, I’m optimistic we’re going to close the current holes in the net,” Duren said. “We need to accelerate our efforts, because we don’t have a lot of time.”"
More than 100  temperature records could be broken across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/weather/weather-record-temperatures-midwest-northeast/index.html,"More than 100  temperature records could be broken across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday
Summerlike heat will continue to build across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday, as temperatures soar to as much as 30 degrees above normal.
Nearly 90 daily records could be broken on Thursday and Friday, mainly across the Midwest and Northeast, and at least 50 record-high minimum temperatures could be set.
This comes after more than 35 daily record highs were broken on Wednesday from Nebraska to Delaware.
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, hit 92 degrees on Wednesday, shattering its old record of 85 set in 1908. Twin Cities, Minnesota, also broke a record after reaching a high of 88 degrees.
Record heat will continue
As an area of high pressure continues to build in the region, this will allow for temperatures to continue to warm and dry conditions to prevail.
“The dry airmass in place makes it quite easy to overachieve on highs and it is certainly possible that we approach 90 again in La Crosse,” the National Weather Service office in La Crosse, Wisconsin, said.
If La Crosse hits 90, that would shatter their old record of 80 degrees.
The heat will stretch as far as the Northeast and parts of New England, with New York City expected to top out in the mid-80s, which will come close to tying or breaking records for Thursday and Friday.
Cities including Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington and even Boston could set records this week.
[Very Warm, Summerlike Thursday!] Full sun & west breezes to bring a summerlike feel to today. Many areas away from the coast are expected to see their first 80+ degree day since last Sept, with upper 80s in the CT Valley!

“Most areas away from Cape Cod, the immediate south coast and the North Shore should see their first 80 degree day since Sept/Oct 2022, and it is not out of the question that the Hartford and Springfield CT Valley areas could get very close to or reach 90,” the weather service office in Boston said.
Overnight lows are also staying warm, which doesn’t allow for much recovery from the heat. More than 75 record-high minimum temperatures could be set by Saturday morning.
Warm temperatures, along with low humidity levels and gusty winds, will create an elevated risk of wildfires.
Elevated fire risk
The weather service is warning of an elevated fire risk while the record warmth and dry conditions persist.
“Fine fuels in the form of dry or dead vegetation will be quite dry as well, and conducive to fire starts and fairly quick fire spread,” the weather service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, warned. “This is particularly true in areas that have not received hardly any rainfall in the last 10 days, across much of Pennsylvania to northern and central New Jersey.”
Winds could gust as high as 35 mph, which will cause any fire that forms to spread quickly.
A wildfire has already broken out in New Jersey this week. The fire is now 75% contained, but it has already scorched roughly 4,000 acres and forced evacuations.

An intensely salty sea which warms to planet-beating temperatures at the height of summer is a hostile place for most vegetation to survive.
Yet in one corner of Abu Dhabi, where briny waters lap sun-scorched shoreline, there’s a forest not only surviving, but thriving – creating a natural sanctuary for wildlife and an extraordinarily peaceful escape from the intensity of the UAE’s desert and cities.
Jubail Mangrove Park is a green expanse of gray mangrove trees on the northeastern edge of Abu Dhabi’s Al Jubail island, where shallow tidal waterways spill out into the clear blue Arabian Sea.
Opened as a tourist attraction just before the pandemic, the park now has a handsome wood-clad reception center and a network of inviting boardwalks that thread through the trees and over the water, offering close-up views of the flora and fauna of this stunning spot.
It’s a tranquil world away from the shimmering skyscrapers and heat-hazed hustle of downtown Abu Dhabi, albeit just a short drive away. Visitors can while away hours here, listening to the call of birds, the watery slap of leaping fish and the lapping of waves.
“Being here is a healing process like yoga, especially at sunrise or sunset,” says Dickson Dulawen, a veteran guide who leads regular kayak or electric boat tours of the mangroves when the tides rise high enough to let small boats venture into the heart of the forest.
“If you’ve had a very bad day, it’s a great place to relax.”
It’s not just humans who benefit from the restorative powers of the mangroves. Scientists say the hardy trees are also helping restore the planet, soaking up and storing away carbon dioxide, encouraging biodiversity and staying one step ahead of climate change.
Dreamlike destination
The best way to see the mangroves working their magic is on the water, following guides like Dulawen in one of Jubail’s brightly colored kayaks. Tours run through the day, and sometimes at night, depending on tides.
Leading the way out via a man-made channel, Dulawen points to the crowds of tiny black crabs that scuttle on the sandy beds around the base of the mangroves.
The plants have a symbiotic deal with the crustaceans, he explains. They munch on discarded leaves and hide from predators in the branches, while also spreading seeds and breaking up the dense salty sediment, enabling root growth.
Those roots are something to behold. Gray mangroves send out a star-shaped network of cable or anchor roots which then sprout their own mini-forest of tubes known as pneumatophores, which poke above the water like snorkels, allowing the plant to breathe.
Pulling the kayaks up onto a pristine sandy beach that only emerges at low tide – a perfect desert island – Dulawen invites closer inspection of mangrove leaves which appear to be sweating salt. It’s part of the process that allows them to grow in seawater that would be toxic to other plants.
Dulawen points out some other plants that form the local ecosystem. There’s green and stubby salt marsh samphire, similar to the plant often found as a kitchen ingredient. He says local Bedouins have traditionally used it as a medicine for treating gassy camels or horses.
A yellow flower blooming on the roots of the samphire is a desert hyacinth, a parasitic plant often harvested for medicinal uses including, says Dulawen, a natural alternative to Viagra.
In the unrelenting heat of an Arabian summer afternoon, out on the water, the mangroves should feel intolerable. Yet, with bathtub-warm waves splashing over the kayaks as Dulawen gently points out a roll call of plants and creatures, a dreamlike quality hangs in the air.
Crab plover birds and green herons flap here and there among the trees, landing to stalk across the soft sediment. In the clear water, upside-down jellyfish can be seen drifting over the swaying seagrass. Dulawen says turtles are frequent visitors.
Ecosystem engineers
The serenity of this corner of Abu Dhabi is partly down to the fact it’s off-limits to the jet skis and pleasure craft which buzz up and down other areas of coastline. Dulawen and his fellow guides help, assiduously scooping up any stray trash and chasing off unwanted guests.
“There’s no other place in the UAE that can compare to here,” he says proudly. “The clarity of water, the natural wildlife. It’s ideal.”
And it keeps getting better. Government and private planting programs have led to an expansion of mangrove areas in recent years, both at Jubail but also Abu Dhabi’s Eastern Mangrove Park. For every tree lost to development elsewhere, three more are planted.
This is an environmental success story, says John Burt, associate professor of biology at New York University Abu Dhabi, who can sometimes be found paddle boarding around the emirate’s waters as part of his team’s research to map the gray mangrove’s genetic data.
He describes the mangroves as “ecosystem engineers,” which not only build up their own habitats but create the perfect environment for scores of other species.
“They’re a hotspot for diversity,” he says. Crabs are happy because of their mangrove deal. Fish are happy because there’s plenty of food for nurturing their young. Fishers are happy because those young grow up to be commercially important harvests in deeper waters.
And birds are happy.
“These mangroves are on a migration route for many, many species of birds flying between Africa and Eurasia,” Burt says. “In the fall season we’ll see a lot of birds stopping to rest and feed in that area because it’s important not only for providing habitat, but also a ton of energy in the food web through dropping leaves.”
There’s something else too. In our era of climate change, Abu Dhabi’s super-resilient mangroves could hold the key to predicting how environments across the planet will adapt to global heating and rising seas, as well as helping alleviate some of the causes.
They’re important as a “blue carbon sink,” a marine ecosystem that takes in more carbon than it puts out, says Burt.
“They’re sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis and a lot of that energy is going into the root system,” he says. “And when they die … all the CO2 it pulled out of the atmosphere will stay there.
“As long as you don’t disturb the area with development, that represents CO2 sequestration. It can have the capacity to offset some of the contributions we’re putting into the air for fossil fuel consumption.”
‘So much green’
And, the professor says, because they thrive in the abnormally salty waters of desert coastal lagoons that in winter can actually get uncomfortably cool for a typically tropical species, Abu Dhabi’s gray mangroves could point the way to species survival elsewhere in the world.
His team is looking at specific genes in the local plants that are associated with “environmental robustness” including resistance to salt and to extreme temperatures, both hot and cold.
“I think that’ll be useful information for looking at a place like Indonesia or Thailand and wondering what’s going to happen to adapt for climate change,” he says.
Mangroves in other parts of the world may have the same tough genes as Abu Dhabi’s trees just waiting to be awakened in the right environmental circumstances. And observing those genes in action in Abu Dhabi could be a good sign.
“It lets us know there’s hope for systems like this,” Burt says.
Back on terra firma with Dulawen, there’s time for a stroll around the Jubail boardwalks as the sun sinks into an orange sky. It’s another peaceful experience, enhanced by a viewing tower that offers vistas over the dense leafy canopy.
In the calm cool of the evening, a few couples and families are enjoying the scenery, among them visitor Balaji Krisna.
“If you want to go and mingle with nature it’s a good spot and not far away from the city,” he says. “It is the only place in Abu Dhabi where you can see so much green.”"
"Oil and gas production in Gulf of Mexico has twice the climate impact of official estimates, researchers say",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/us/oil-gas-gulf-mexico-drilling-methane-climate/index.html,"Oil and gas production in Gulf of Mexico has twice the climate impact of official estimates, researchers say
Oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is belching out significantly higher levels of potent, planet-heating gas than previously thought, according to new research, which found the climate effects of the operations are twice that of official estimates.
The report comes as the Biden administration last month put millions of acres of water in the Gulf of Mexico up for auction to offshore oil and gas drilling, and has plans for further auctions.
In August 2020, scientists spent 10 days doing airborne surveys of more than 50 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Flying in concentric rings around the facilities, they measured plumes of carbon pollution from burning processes as well as methane pollution from leaks and venting.
They combined the findings with previous emissions surveys and inventories to calculate the “carbon intensity” of oil and gas operations – the total amount of planet-warming pollution released for each unit of energy produced.
Their results revealed a climate impact twice as large as that estimated by government inventories, driven by high levels of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its first two decades in the atmosphere.
Methane pollution in the Gulf of Mexico totaled 600,000 metric tons a year, according to the report, which found that average methane levels in federal waters were three times higher than official inventories, and 13 times higher in state waters.
“Inventories are generally challenged by methane,” Alan Gorchov Negron, a study co-author and climate science researcher at the University of Michigan, told CNN. Unlike carbon pollution, which comes from burning the fuel, methane from oil and gas operations escapes into the atmosphere – either through deliberate venting and flaring or accidentally through dilapidated equipment or unknown leaks.
The study found that the worst climate performers were platforms in shallow waters, which include older style “central-hub platforms” that collect oil and gas from smaller platforms for processing. These have an “extraordinarily high” carbon intensity that far exceeds that of deeper water facilities, according to the report’s authors.
There are multiple reasons for this outsized climate impact of shallow-water platforms, according to the report, including persistent venting, emissions associated with equipment as well as the tendency of the facilities to be older and sometimes poorly maintained.
Even though shallow-water oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico have declined since 2000, the facilities will still likely have an impact for years to come, especially as these areas are included in prospective lease sales, the report noted.
There is an upside to identifying their high levels of pollution, said Eric Kort, a report co-author and associate professor in climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The good news is that the bulk of emissions comes from one class of facilities, which means mitigation measures can be more targeted,” he told CNN.
The report outlines a series of measures to tackle planet-warming pollution from offshore oil and gas, including replacing venting with efficient flaring, refurbishing and repairing equipment, and plugging and abandoning platforms which cannot be repaired or improved.
The study’s findings may be particularly pertinent, Negron said, as “the Gulf of Mexico is on the eve of a series of expansions in production.”
The Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate and energy bill signed into law last year, includes provisions inserted by Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, for more of the Gulf of Mexico to be made available for oil and gas drilling. Manchin has argued the US should ramp up its oil and gas drilling to become more energy independent, especially as gas prices rise.
There are up to 10 new lease sales proposed between now and 2028, according to the report.
Climate considerations must legally be factored into decisions on drilling. In 2022, a federal judge invalidated an 80-million-acre oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico for not taking climate impacts into account, after a coalition of environmental groups sued the Biden administration.
“This discussion around carbon intensity in the Gulf of Mexico will pop up in at least 10 more environmental impact statements,” Negron said.
Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, said: “This study underscores what we’ve long known to be true: offshore drilling in the Gulf puts coastal communities at risk and threatens devastating and irreversible harm to our climate.”
“The Biden administration should take this alarming data seriously and protect our climate and communities by putting an end to all new leasing in the Gulf,” he told CNN."
The oceans just reached their hottest temperature on record as El Niño looms. Here are 6 things to watch for,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/01/world/el-nino-forecast-weather-climate-impacts/index.html,"The oceans just reached their hottest temperature on record as El Niño looms. Here are 6 things to watch for
Scientists have watched in astonishment as ocean temperatures have steadily risen over the past several years – even as the cooling La Niña phenomenon had a firm grip on the Pacific. The oceans have been record-warm for the past four years, scientists reported in January. Then in mid-March, climatologists noted that global sea surface temperature climbed to a new high.
The incredible trend worries experts about what could lie ahead, especially as forecasts predict El Niño is on its way starting this summer – and along with it, impacts like extreme heat, dangerous tropical cyclones and a significant threat to fragile coral reefs.
La Niña and El Niño are natural phenomena in the tropical Pacific Ocean; La Niña is marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures, while El Niño brings warmer-than-average temperatures. Both have major influence weather across the globe. And a switch to El Niño will almost assuredly bring warmer global temperatures along with it.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, said there is already a “dramatic transition” from La Niña to El Niño happening in the tropical Pacific.
“Right now, the atmosphere and the ocean are both in sync and screaming ‘El Niño rapid development’ over the next few months,” he said.
The last three years have still been some of the warmest on record, even with La Niña’s cooling effect.  “We’re now switching that off,” Professor Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the UK Met Office, told CNN.
It’s unclear how strong the coming El Niño will be – some models predict it could reach super-strength, others suggest it will be more moderate. But what is clear is that, layered on top of human-caused global heating, the signs point to El Niño ushering in severe and unprecedented impacts for many parts of the world.
Here are six weather and climate extremes to look out for.
The world could breach 1.5 degrees of warming for the first time
El Niño could – for the first time – push the world past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above the pre-industrial levels of the mid-to-late 1800s.
Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
A strong El Niño could push the planet to that point, Scaife said, even if only temporarily.
“We will probably have, in 2024, the warmest year globally on record,” Josef Ludescher a senior scientist at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told CNN. The hottest year on record is currently 2016, which followed a very strong El Niño.
The world has already seen around 1.2 degrees of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. And despite three years of cooling La Niña, temperatures have soared to dangerous levels.
Europe saw its hottest summer in 2022, with temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and Pakistan and India experienced a searing heatwave, where parts of the country reached more than 49 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit).
Ultimately, whether the 1.5-degree threshold is hit or narrowly missed “doesn’t really matter,” Scaife said. “It’s the first time in human history that that value is within reach – and that’s the really significant point.”
Whatever the exact level of heating El Niño brings, some of its impacts – including extreme temperatures – are very likely to be unprecedented, Scaife said. “Each time we now get an El Niño, it’s adding on to an ever-larger amount of global warming that we’ve accrued.”
There could be more drought-busting rain in the West
California has seen an onslaught of rain and snow in recent months. That could intensify during El Niño.
California already faces potential flood threats this spring, NOAA reported in March, after record-breaking snow fell in the Sierra and torrential rain drenched the rest of the state.
Once El Niño kicks in, much of the state will likely see an elevated chance of above-normal rainfall with an increased risk of flooding, landslides and coastal erosion, experts told CNN.
It could even deliver “meaningful drought relief” to the Colorado River Basin, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture.
“Whereas La Niña is historically a ‘drought maker’ for the continental United States, El Niño is a ‘drought breaker,’” Rippey told CNN. “Although the exact location of drought, or lack thereof, varies considerably from event to event.”
The situation on the Colorado River, which provides water for drinking, irrigation and electricity for roughly 40 million people across the Southwest, has been plagued by overuse and a climate change-fueled drought. The water crisis has become so dire that the federal government announced never-before-seen mandatory water cuts in the last two years.
Jon Gottschalck, a head forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, echoed Rippey, noting that a stronger and extended Pacific jet stream — fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day-to-day weather — could “elevate odds for atmospheric river-type events for the West Coast,” while also causing more intense precipitation in the South.
Drought, heat and fire elsewhere
In other parts of the world, El Niño could amplify droughts, fierce heatwaves and dangerous wildfires.
South Africa and India are at risk of drought and extreme heat, as are nations near the West Pacific including Indonesia, Australia and Pacific island nations such as Vanuatu and Fiji.
For Australia – still reeling from extensive flooding – El Niño is likely to bring much drier, hotter weather, especially in the eastern areas of the country. Since 1900, 18 of the 27 El Niño years have meant widespread winter and spring drought, a spokesperson for Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology told CNN.
Its recent floods have also increased fears for a particularly destructive bushfire season, as increased vegetation growth could provide fuel for fires as the weather gets drier and hotter.
India, too, is bracing itself for the impacts of El Niño, which can weaken the monsoon that brings the rainfall it relies on for filling aquifers and growing crops.
The monsoon tends to be most affected when there is a flip from a La Niña winter, which we have just seen, to an El Niño summer, which the 2023 summer is likely to be, said Raghu Murtugudde, an Earth systems scientist at the University of Maryland.
“The overall [monsoon rainfall] deficit can be as high as 15%,” he told CNN.
El Niño could also push up temperatures in India, which is already experiencing unusually early heatwaves. It’s a “compound hazard because heat waves and El Niño tend to delay the onset of the monsoon,” said Kieren Hunt, a research scientist at the University of Reading in England.
Months of dry spells would “put a tremendous strain on water security,” he said.
Warmer Pacific Ocean fuels stronger cyclones
One of the first fingerprints of El Niño, according to Gottschalck, will be evident in the changes in tropical cyclone activity.
Unlike La Niña, El Niño tends to reduce Atlantic hurricane activity, but creates the opposite effect in the Pacific, where warm waters can fuel more intense typhoons.
“Tropical cyclones can often form further west in the basin and remain stronger longer and so potential impacts to Hawaii are increased,” Gottschalck said. This means “more chances of landfall and remotely driven impacts, such as stronger and longer duration seas, heavy rainfall, and more.”
Elsewhere in the Pacific, Swain said models show “very warm waters” off the coast of Peru that are already bringing in unusually heavy precipitation and flooding in the deserts. “That is a classic precursor to a significant El Niño event.”
As El Niño forms and strengthens later this year, Peru could be at even greater risk of more flooding. The government is already set to invest more than $1 billion on climate and weather measures to prevent the worst consequences.
Coral reefs could see catastrophic bleaching
El Niño is an ocean heater, and warmer water is bad news for coral reefs.
When they get too hot, corals will spit out the algae living within their tissue, which provides them with both their color and most of their energy. This causes corals to turn white – in a phenomenon called bleaching. While they can recover if temperatures eventually cool, bleaching puts them at higher risk of starvation and death.
A particularly catastrophic period of coral bleaching happened between 2014 and 2017 – hitting every major reef on earth. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef saw nearly 30% of its corals die in a record-breaking marine heatwave in 2016 – which followed a very strong El Niño that started in 2015.
More mass bleaching events have followed, and with El Niño on the horizon, scientists are increasingly concerned about the impacts on coral that has simply not had enough time to recover.
“What’s being predicted here is very scary,” said Peter Houk, a professor at the University of Guam Marine Laboratory who studies coral in Micronesia. “Every time one comes it grows a little bit more in intensity.”
El Niño doesn’t necessarily mean that all coral will be affected, Houk said. Each El Niño is different and there are always other natural climate patterns at play. “But when it does happen, it’s brutal,” he said.
Whenever it arrives, El Niño is going to be a chance to learn more about how coral reacts and where pockets of resilience might appear, Houk said. He just wants it to hold off a bit longer. “We hope that the predictions are wrong and then we can buy a few more years for the corals to recover.”
More Antarctic ice melt?
Antarctic ice is already in trouble and El Niño could make it worse.
Earlier this year, ice levels on the continent dipped to record-breaking lows for the second time in two years, sparking fear that after years of ups and downs, it could now be on a steep downward trend.
El Niño could help speed up this process, according to recent research, which found a link between the strength and frequency of El Niño events and the speed of Antarctic ice melt.
“Models that project a greater increase in El Niño systematically produce a faster ice sheet melt than models that projected a smaller change in El Niño,” Wenju Cai, chief research scientist at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, told CNN.
Scientists are watching Antarctica closely because it holds such a catastrophic amount of water in its ice. Though the Antarctic ice sheet is unlikely to melt completely, it has enough water in it to raise global sea level by 230 feet (70 meters).
In the immediate term, El Niño events have divergent impacts across Antarctica, Cai said, with increases and decreases in different areas. But taken together, he said, the trend is clear – “an overall sea ice decrease.”"

EU agrees to double renewables by 2030 and UK unveils its long-awaited climate plan
Two big announcements in European climate policy came Thursday. The European Union reached a provisional deal to increase its renewable energy targets, an important pillar of the bloc’s plans to fight climate change and end dependence on Russian fossil fuels. And the United Kingdom released its long-awaited climate strategy, promising “an energy revolution.”
EU pledges to double renewables
Negotiators from the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, which represents EU member states, agreed that by 2030, the 27-country bloc would commit to sourcing 42.5% of its energy from renewable sources like wind and solar, with a potential top-up to 45%.
The European Union’s current target is for a 32% renewable energy share by 2030.
In 2021, the bloc got 22% of its energy from renewable sources, though the level varied significantly between countries. Sweden leads with a 63% renewable energy share, while in Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Ireland, renewable sources make up less than 13% of total energy use.
A rapid shift to renewable energy is crucial if the European Union is to meet its climate goals, including a legally binding aim to cut levels of planet-heating gases by 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.
Renewable energy targets have gained significance since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union has vowed to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027 and plans to do this mostly through locally produced, low-carbon energy.
Reaching the new goals will require massive investment in wind and solar farms, scaling up production of renewable gases, and reinforcing Europe’s power grids to integrate more clean energy.
The European Commission has said additional investments of 113 billion euros ($123 billion) in renewable energy and hydrogen infrastructure will be needed by 2030, if EU countries are to end their reliance on Russian fossil fuels.
Thursday’s deal must be approved by the European Parliament and EU countries to become law, normally a formality.
UK climate strategy
The United Kingdom also announced its own climate strategy Thursday. The plan sets out a pathway for the nation to reach net zero — which means removing from the air at least as much planet-heating pollution as it emits.
The strategy focuses on clean energy technologies, and energy security in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.
It includes support for offshore wind energy, electric vehicles, green hydrogen, nuclear technology, home insulation and home heat pumps.
The strategy also emphasizes carbon capture and storage, which traps and stores carbon pollution. While many scientists say this technology will be crucial for meeting climate goals, it has also been heavily criticized for allowing polluters to continue polluting, rather than cutting their emissions.
UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt said in a statement: “Transforming our energy system is no longer just about tackling climate change, it is also a matter of national security. To protect ourselves from future price spikes, we need to accelerate the move to cleaner, cheaper, home-grown energy.”
The strategy announcement comes after a UK court ruled last year that the government had not adequately set out how it intended to reach net zero.
It also follows the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate investment in American history, which has kick-started a global green subsidies race.
Some have criticized the UK government’s new plans as weak. Pauline Chetcuti, head of policy at the non-profit Oxfam, said in a statement that they are “tinkering around the edges but are far off the mark for the scale of the challenge we face.”

Ten photographs that made the world wake up to climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/climate-change-photography-paul-nicklen-cristina-mittermeier-c2e-spc-intl-scn-climate/index.html,"Ten photographs that made the world wake up to climate change
Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
Water cascading from a wall of ice with gray brushstrokes of clouds overhead makes for a beautiful image – but the story behind it is one of destruction; Earth’s glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate due to human-caused climate change.
Canadian photographer Paul Nicklen remembers taking the photograph. It was August 2014, and temperatures in Svalbard, Norway, were unusually warm – hovering above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). As he came around the corner of an ice cap on Nordaustlandet island, he saw more than a dozen waterfalls pouring off its face.
“It was the most poetic, beautiful scene I’d ever seen, but it was also haunting and scary,” he recalls. The picture came to symbolize the realities of climate change and became Nicklen’s best-selling fine art image. It appeared multiple times in National Geographic, was used by Al Gore in his climate talks, and graced the cover of Pearl Jam’s 2020 album “Gigaton,” the title of which refers to the unit used to calculate ice mass.
Its beauty is central to its impact, believes Nicklen. “When you take a photograph that is in focus, properly exposed, moody and powerful, it creates a visceral reaction,” he says. “It has to be beautiful and engaging, it has to invite you in … and it has to have a conservation message.”
In 2014, Nicklen, along with his wife Cristina Mittermeier, and later joined by Andy Mann (both also award-winning photographers), co-founded the nonprofit organization SeaLegacy, which uses film and photography to raise awareness of climate issues and help protect the planet.
“Photography is one of the most effective and powerful tools we have to tell complex stories, like the story of climate change,” says Mittermeier.
She witnessed this power with one of her own photographs, taken in August 2017, which showed a starving polar bear. After being published in National Geographic, the photo and accompanying video went viral, shared on social media and by news organizations worldwide. It sparked a global conversation on climate change, provoking responses ranging from concern and empathy to climate denial. But there was no denying that it shook the world: “People still remember it and have strong reactions when they see it,” Mittermeier reflects.
As guest editors for CNN’s Call to Earth series, Nicklen and Mittermeier selected these two images, along with eight others, that they believe have alerted the world to the climate crisis.
War photographers
Nicklen compares photographing climate change to photographing conflict. “We’re out there on the front lines of the war being waged against our planet. It’s emotionally draining, exhausting,” he says.
In recent decades, as climate disasters have become more frequent and intense, images have more explicitly captured the urgency of the situation. Six dead giraffes, bodies emaciated from the lack of food and water, photographed by Ed Ram, show the horror of Kenya’s prolonged ongoing drought, which has threatened and displaced animals and humans alike. Photographs of wildfires, like those that ravaged Australia in 2019 and 2020, show the scale of devastation, with homes on fire and wildlife fleeing in despair.
“They show that climate change isn’t just happening somewhere else, it’s happening everywhere,” says Mittermeier. “All of a sudden, it will come knocking a lot closer to your own door.”
Mittermeier remembers the work of her friend and one of her great influences, Gary Braasch, who she describes as a “chronicler of climate change.” The photographer, who died in 2016, dedicated the last two decades of his life to documenting how the Earth was changing in response to global warming – from Antarctica, with its melting glaciers, to Bhola Island in Bangladesh, where sea level rise and increasing erosion have turned villages into islands. Braasch’s commitment to the cause blazed the way for Nicklen and Mittermeier’s generation of conservation photographers.
The slow retreat
At times however, climate change can be tediously slow to chronicle. Sea levels rise by a matter of millimeters each year – a barely visible increment despite happening at a faster rate than ever before. But such changes add up, and if they are visually documented over years or decades the impact becomes clear.
“It’s like photographing a slow-moving tsunami,” says Mittermeier. “It’s often hard to see in the moment, but when two images are put side-by-side, it’s hard not to see the impact the climate crisis is having.”
Read: Scientists are listening to glaciers to discover the secrets of the oceans
The work of photographer James Balog has been crucial in creating the visual narrative of climate change, she says. Using a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers around the world, his Extreme Ice Survey has demonstrated how glaciers are vanishing over time. The extensive archive of photos of each glacier taken year-round at every daylight hour has also provided a baseline from which future changes can be measured.
“It became just irrefutable proof,” says Mittermeier. “That was a very important moment for climate photography.”
Coexistence
Mittermeier and Nicklen also selected images where humans and nature collide. One effect of climate change is a dramatic loss of biodiversity. Since 1970, wildlife populations have plummeted by 69%, due predominantly to land-use change that has fragmented crucial habitats, and also rising temperatures, which have led to mass mortality events, according to the WWF’s 2022 Living Planet Report.
Read: The icy patience of an Arctic photographer
With the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the globe, the ice that polar bears depend on is melting away. Dmitry Kokh’s photograph “House of Bears,” one of the winners of the 2022 Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, shows polar bears roaming an abandoned Soviet settlement on Kolyuchin Island. While the buildings had long been deserted, Mittermeier believes it points to the increasing problem of polar bears – with no ice left to hunt on – encroaching on human spaces and encountering local people, leading to tragic outcomes for both sides.
The effects of climate change will – and are already – hitting animals and humans alike. “It’s impossible to deny that we are all in this together,” says Mittermeier. “We are all impacted in devastating ways, and we cannot separate ourselves from the life we share this planet with.”
The series “The Day May Break” from photographer Nick Brandt portrays this by showing people and animals affected by environmental destruction. The photographs, taken in animal sanctuaries around the world, feature people that have been displaced by climate change events such as drought or floods, and animals that have been victims of habitat destruction or wildlife trafficking. Portraying both in the same frame shows how deeply our fates are intertwined.
Hope
Among the images of devastation and displacement, there are also those that signify hope. In Brandt’s work, he points out that the subjects of the images, both people and animals, are survivors – “And therein lies hope and possibility,” he wrote in an email.
Read: The ocean’s ‘blue carbon’ can be our secret weapon in fighting climate change
For Mittermeier and Nicklen, and SeaLegacy as a whole, striking a message of hope is vital to the wider mission. “Martin Luther King didn’t start his famous speech by reminding us that we live in a nightmare – he told us what the dream is,” says Mittermeier. “You have to point out what it is that we’re aspiring to and show where the hope is.”
The hope, she believes, is in wildlife and the ocean. Humans are just waking up to the role that both play in mitigating climate change, and restoring nature will be crucial in averting the crisis. For Mittermeier, her photograph of a sea lion rising up to the surface in the Galapagos – one of the largest marine protected areas in the world – shows how ocean life can flourish with the right protection. And Nicklen’s photograph of a bowhead whale represents to him one of our greatest allies in decarbonization: not only are whales’ bodies enormous stores of carbon, their feces fuels phytoplankton which soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
By showing off the beauty of the planet, the couple believe they can show people it is still worth fighting for.
“We’re trying to climb to the tallest mountain and scream from the mountaintops that this planet is dying, and that we are at risk,” says Nicklen.
“But the only emotion greater than fear is hope,” adds Mittermeier. “And the only way you can feel hope is if you take action.”"
"Crucial Antarctic ocean circulation heading for collapse if planet-warming pollution remains high, scientists warn",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/antarctic-overturning-collapse-2050-climate-scn-intl-hnk/index.html,"Crucial Antarctic ocean circulation heading for collapse if planet-warming pollution remains high, scientists warn
Melting ice in the Antarctic is not just raising sea levels but slowing down the circulation of deep ocean water with vast implications for the global climate and for marine life, a new study warns.
Led by scientists from the University of New South Wales and published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the peer-reviewed study modeled the impact of melting Antarctic ice on deep ocean currents that work to flush nutrients from the sea floor to fish near the surface.
Three years of computer modeling found the Antarctic overturning circulation – also known as abyssal ocean overturning – is on track to slow 42% by 2050 if the world continues to burn fossil fuels and produce high levels of planet-heating pollution.
A slow down is expected to speed up ice melt and potentially end an ocean system that has helped sustain life for thousands of years.
“The projections we have make it look like the Antarctic overturning would collapse this century,” said Matthew England, deputy director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science, who coordinated the study.
“In the past, these overturning circulations changed over the course of 1,000 years or so, and we’re talking about changes within a few decades. So it is pretty dramatic,” he said.
Most previous studies have focused on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the system of currents that carry warm water from the tropics into the North Atlantic. The cold, saltier water then sinks and flows south.
Its Southern Ocean equivalent is less studied but does an important job moving nutrient-dense water north from Antarctica, past New Zealand and into the North Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean, the report’s authors said in a briefing.
The circulation of deep ocean water is considered vital for the health of the sea – and plays an important role in sequestering carbon absorbed from the atmosphere.
According to the report, while a slowdown of the AMOC would mean the deep Atlantic Ocean would get colder, the slower circulation of dense water in the Antarctic means the deepest waters of the Southern Ocean will warm up.
“One of the concerning things of this slowdown is that there can be feedback to further ocean warming at the base of the ice shelves around Antarctica. And that would lead to more ice melt, reinforcing or amplifying the original change,” England said.
How does it work
As global temperatures rise, Antarctic ice is expected to melt faster, but that doesn’t mean the circulation of deep water will increase – in fact the opposite, scientists said.
In a healthy system, the cold and salty – or dense – consistency of melted Antarctic ice allows it to sink to the deepest layer of the ocean. From there it sweeps north, carrying carbon and higher levels of oxygen than might otherwise be present in water around 4,000 meters deep.
As the current moves northward, it agitates deep layers of debris on the ocean floor – remains of decomposing sea life thick with nutrients – that feed the bottom of the food chain, scientists said.
In certain areas, mostly south of Australia in the Southern Ocean and in the tropics, this nutrient-rich cold water moves toward the surface in a process called upwelling, distributing the nutrients to higher layers of the ocean, England said.
However, Wednesday’s study found that as global temperatures warm, melting sea ice “freshens” the water around Antarctica, diluting its saltiness and raising its temperature, meaning it’s less dense and doesn’t sink to the bottom as efficiently as it once did.
The report’s co-author, Steve Rintoul from Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership, said sea life in waters worldwide rely on nutrients brought back up to the surface, and that the Antarctic overturning is a key component of that upwelling of nutrients.
“We know that nutrients exported from the Southern Ocean in other current systems support about three quarters of global phytoplankton production – the base of the food chain,” he said.
“We’ve shown that the sinking of dense water near Antarctica will decline by 40% by 2050. And it’ll be sometime between 2050 and 2100 that we start to see the impacts of that on surface productivity.”
England added: “People born today are going to be around then. So, it’s certainly stuff that will challenge societies in the future.”
Climate change warning
The report’s authors say the slowing of the Antarctic ocean overturning has other knock-on effects for the planet – for example, it could shift rain bands in the tropics by as much as 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).
“Shut it down completely and you get this reduction of rainfall in one band south of the equator and an increase in the band to the north. So we could see impacts on rainfall in the tropics,” said England.
Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in its latest report that the impacts of rising global temperatures were more severe than expected. Without immediate and deep changes, the world is hurtling toward increasingly dangerous and irreversible consequences of climate change, it added.
The IPCC report found that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels was still possible, but it’s becoming harder to achieve the longer the world fails to cut carbon pollution.
England points out that the IPCC predictions don’t include ice melt from Antarctic ice sheets and shelves.
“That’s a very significant component of change that’s already underway around Antarctica with more to come in the next few decades,” England said.
Rintoul said the study was another urgent warning on top of all the ones that have come before it.
“Even though the direct effect on fisheries through reduced nutrient supply might take decades to play out, we will commit ourselves to that future with the choices we make over the next decade.”"
"Global water crisis could ‘spiral out of control’ due to overconsumption and climate change, UN report warns",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/22/world/global-water-crisis-un-report-climate-intl/index.html,"Global water crisis could ‘spiral out of control’ due to overconsumption and climate change, UN report warns
The world is facing a looming global water crisis that threatens to “spiral out of control” as increased demand for water and the intensifying impacts of the climate crisis put huge pressure on water resources, a UN report has warned.
Water use has increased by about 1% a year over the last 40 years, driven by population growth and changing consumption patters, according to the UN World Water Development Report published Tuesday, on the eve of a major UN water summit in New York.
By 2050, the number of people in cities facing water scarcity is projected to nearly double from 930 million people in 2016 to up to 2.4 billion, the report found. Urban water demand is expected to increase by 80% by 2050.
Without action to address the problem of water scarcity, “there definitely will be a global crisis,” said Richard Connor, the report’s lead author, at a news conference to launch the report.
‘Dire consequences’
Water access is already a huge problem. Two billion people do not currently have safe drinking water and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report.
About 10% of the global population already lives in countries with high or critical water stress.
Urban and industrial growth and agriculture are compounding existing shortages, with agriculture alone using up 70% of the world’s water supply, Connor said.
Seasonal water scarcity is set to increase in areas where water is currently plentiful including in Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America, the report found. Meanwhile, scarcity will worsen in the Middle East and the Sahel region in Africa, where water is already in short supply.
Extreme and prolonged droughts, made more frequent and severe by the climate crisis, are also putting pressure on ecosystems, which could have “dire consequences” for plant and animal species, the report’s authors said.
Solutions include better international cooperation to avoid conflicts over water, Connor said.
Flood and pollution control, data sharing and efforts to reduce levels of planet-heating pollution should “open the door to further collaboration and increase access to water funds,” he said.
“There is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiraling out of control,” said Audrey Azoulay, the director general of UNESCO, the UN’s cultural body.
“Water is our common future, and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably.”"

Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.
The world is rapidly approaching catastrophic levels of heating with international climate goals set to slip out of reach unless immediate and radical action is taken, according to a new UN-backed report.
“The climate time-bomb is ticking,” said António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in a statement to mark the launch of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s synthesis report on Monday. “Humanity is on thin ice – and that ice is melting fast,” he added.
The report draws on the findings of hundreds of scientists to provide a comprehensive assessment of how the climate crisis is unfolding.
The science is not new – the report pulls together what the IPCC has already set out in a cluster of other reports over the last few years – but it paints a very stark picture of where the world is heading.
“This report is the most dire and troubling assessment yet of the spiraling climate impacts we all face if systemic changes are not made now,” Sara Shaw, program coordinator at Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement.
The impacts of planet-warming pollution are already more severe than expected and we are hurtling towards increasingly dangerous and irreversible consequences, the report says.
While the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels is still possible, the report noted, the pathway to achieving it is rapidly closing as global production of planet-heating pollution continues to increase – emissions grew by nearly 1% last year.
Concentrations of carbon pollution in the atmosphere are at their highest level for more than two million years and the rate of temperature rise over the last half a century is the highest in 2,000 years.
The impacts of the climate crisis continue to fall hardest on poorer, vulnerable countries that have done least to cause it.
“Our planet is already reeling from severe climate impacts, from scorching heat waves and destructive storms to severe droughts and water shortages,” said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of World Resources Institute, in a statement.
The biggest threat to climate change action is the world’s continued addiction to burning fossil fuels, which still make up more than 80% of the world’s energy and 75% of human-caused planet-heating pollution.
Despite the International Energy Agency saying in 2021 that there can now be no new fossil fuel developments if the world is to meet climate commitments, governments are continuing to approve oil, gas and coal projects.
The Biden administration has just greenlit the hugely controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Once operational, it is projected to produce enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year – equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads.
Arati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement that the new UN  report shows “the Earth’s future is not predetermined.”
“It underscores the urgent need for leaders in every sector and every country to step up and take bold climate action,” Prabhakar said.
China is planning a huge expansion of coal – the dirtiest of fossil fuels. In 2022, it granted permits for coal production across 82 sites, equal to starting two large coal power plants each week, according to a report last month.
But Monday’s report also set out pathways to keep the world on track to limit warming to within 1.5 degrees. “This IPCC report is both a blistering condemnation of major emitters’ inaction and a sound blueprint for a much safer and more equitable world,” Dasgupta said.
Staving off the worst impacts of the climate crisis will require radical shifts across every sector of the economy and society, according to the report.
It called for deep cuts to planet-heating pollution by moving away from fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees, global levels of planet-heating pollution must fall by 60% by 2035 compared with 2019, according to the report.
It emphasized the need for greater investment to build resilience to climate impacts, and increased support for people struggling with climate-related losses, especially in the most vulnerable countries.
The report also said we need to remove carbon from the air, including potentially through technology such as “direct air capture” – removing carbon directly from the air and storing it, possibly by injecting it underground.
This technology does remain divisive, however, as some believe it distracts from policies to cut planet-heating pollution.
“In my country, Sri Lanka, the impacts of climate change are being felt now. We have no time to chase fairy tales like carbon removal technologies to suck carbon out of the air,” Hemantha Withanage, chair of Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement.
Guterres called on all countries to “massively fast-track climate efforts” and, specifically, for rich countries to hit “the fast-forward button” on commitments to reach net-zero – which means removing as much plant-heating pollution from the atmosphere as they emit.
For the first time, he said developed countries must reach net-zero as close to 2040 as possible, far earlier than the 2050 deadline a lot of countries – including the US and the UK – have pledged to meet.
“Today’s IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb,” Guterres said. “But it will take a quantum leap in climate action,” he added.
The report, which was signed off over the weekend by representatives from the UN’s nearly 200 countries, will feed into the next UN climate conference, COP28, in Dubai at the end of the year. The conference will include the first “global stocktake” from the Paris Climate Agreement, an assessment of progress toward addressing the climate crisis and averting climate catastrophe."
"‘Endless, brutal heat’: Argentina’s late-season heatwave has ‘no similarities in history’",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/americas/argentina-record-heatwave-climate-intl/index.html,"‘Endless, brutal heat’: Argentina’s late-season heatwave has ‘no similarities in history’
Argentina is grappling with an unprecedented late-summer heatwave as temperatures soar to record-breaking levels – causing crops to wither, helping wildfires spread and adding huge pressure to a country already facing an economic crisis.
The country’s summer, which technically runs from December to February, was by far the hottest on record, according to Maximiliano Herrara, a climatologist who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe.
And, so far, March has offered no relief.
Temperatures during the first 10 days of March were 8 to 10 degrees Celsius (14 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal in east-central Argentina, according to the country’s National Meteorological Service.
These temperature anomalies, which have persisted over huge areas, are unprecedented, Herrara told CNN. “There is nothing similar that has ever happened in climatic history in Argentina at this scale.”
Herrara said he had expected a “scorching summer” in Argentina due to the impacts of La Niña, a climate pattern which tends to bring hotter, drier summers to the region. But what has happened shocked him, he said.
“The length – five months – and intensity of this endless, brutal heat went beyond what I had imagined,” Herrara said.
The brutal heat in Argentina and Uruguay in the first half of this month has no similarities in history.In the first 10 days of the month, average max. temperatures in the Central-Eastern Argentina were +8/+10C above the 1991-2020 normal.Totally insane and out of any range. https://t.co/vTcORnBd0U
Records have been beaten time and time again.
Buenos Aires has seen highs above 30 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) every day since February 28. Multiple other locations across the country saw their highest temperatures in the last 63 years during March.
In key agricultural provinces of Córdoba, Santa Fe and Northern Buenos Aires, the heat has been “catastrophic” for corn and soybean crops, Mickaël Attia, crop analyst for EarthDaily Analytics, told CNN.
“The worst drought of the last 30 years in Argentina will have an enormous impact on national corn and soybean production, which is expected to be at least 20-30% lower than last year,” he said.
Wheat is also affected. Exports are projected to fall 28% in 2023 compared to last year, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
Farmers are facing loses of around $14 billion, Julio Calzada, head of economic research at the Rosario Grains Exchange, told Reuters.
There are fears that the agricultural crisis will exacerbate the country’s economic problems. Figures released this week showed yearly inflation topped 100% for the first time in three decades – one of the highest inflation rates in the world.
The heat-stricken country is also grappling with wildfires. More than 100,000 hectares (nearly 250,000 acres) have been burned this year in northeast Argentina, according to an AFP report.
While Argentina’s brutal heatwave has been driven by La Niña, which has just ended after three consecutive years, some scientists have pointed to the role the climate crisis plays in intensifying these events.
A February report from the World Weather Attribution initiative found that while climate change was not the main driver of low rainfall in central South America, it was causing higher temperatures in the region, likely reducing water availability and making the drought more severe.
Another WWA report in December found that record temperatures in Argentina and other South American countries late last year were made 60 times more likely by human-caused climate change.
Herrera cautioned against blaming individual extreme weather events on the climate crisis, but, he said, “generally speaking it’s true that climate change, by fueling more energy to the atmosphere and the oceans, might be responsible for bigger contrasts which in turn worsen such extreme events.”
As global temperatures continue to rise, scientists say heatwaves will only become more common.

Only 13 countries and territories had ‘healthy’ air quality in 2022,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/world/air-pollution-report-2022-climate/index.html,"Only 13 countries and territories had ‘healthy’ air quality in 2022
Only 13 of the world’s countries and territories had “healthy” air quality last year, according to a new report, as air pollution surged to alarming levels in 2022.
The report by IQAir, a company that tracks air quality worldwide, found that average annual air pollution in roughly 90% of the countries and territories analyzed exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which are designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.
IQAir analyzed average air quality from 131 countries and territories, and found that just six countries — Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — and seven territories in the Pacific and Caribbean, including Guam and Puerto Rico, met the WHO air quality guidelines, which call for an average air pollution level of 5 micrograms per cubic meter or less.
Seven countries – Chad, Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Kuwait and India – had poor air quality that far exceeded the WHO guidelines with average air pollution over 50 micrograms per cubic meter.
The study looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous. When inhaled, the PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health problems including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.
WHO tightened its annual air pollution guidelines in September 2021, cutting the acceptable amount of fine particulate matter from 10 to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.
Millions of people die each year from air pollution-related health issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to the UN agency. If the latest guidelines had been applied back then, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.
The report also continues to highlight a worrying inequality: the lack of monitoring stations in developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, which results in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.
Although Africa saw improvement in the number of countries included in this year’s report compared with 2021, the continent still largely remains the most underrepresented. According to IQAir, only 19 out of 54 African countries had sufficient data available from their monitoring stations.
Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, said that each time it adds a new country that once lacked air quality data – as it did with Chad in 2021 – those countries inevitably wind up at the top of the most-polluted list.
“If you look at what’s called satellite or modeled data, Africa is supposed to be probably the most polluted continent on the planet, but we don’t have enough data,” Hammes told CNN. “What that means is there’s a whole lot more data that’s needed in order for us to truly determine what are the most polluted countries and cities in the world.”
But one of the biggest barriers right now, she said, is “the way that governments currently monitor air quality.” Hammes said most governments tend to invest in instruments that fail to accurately measure fine particulate matter in the air.
In the United States, the report found air pollution improved significantly last year compared with 2021 due to a relatively mild wildfire season.
Coffeyville, Kansas, had the worst air quality in the US last year, which IQAir attributed to a nearby oil refinery. Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta and Chicago topped the list of major US cities with the worst air quality, though the researchers also noted that California was home to 10 of the 15 worst major cities for air pollution, including Los Angeles and Sacramento.
Around the world, researchers said, the main sources of air pollution last year were wildfires and the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and energy production, which wreaks havoc on the most vulnerable and marginalized communities.
“This is literally about how we as a planet are continuing this unhealthy relationship with fossil fuels,” Hammes said. “We are still dependent on fossil fuels and fossil fuels are responsible for the majority of air pollution that we encounter on this planet.”
China, which had for decades been near the top of the list for the worst air pollution, continued to show improved air quality in 2022. Nearly 64% of the 524 cities analyzed in mainland China saw reductions in annual PM2.5.
Still, IQAir notes that the country’s coal usage continues to be a major climate and environmental concern, and that despite the improvement, none of the Chinese cities actually met the annual WHO guidelines.
Climate change-fueled wildfires, Hammes said, also play a significant role in worsening air quality, especially in the US. The report notes that wildfires in recent years have been rapidly erasing air quality improvements that the US has made over the past decade.
“Wildfires are very much so a global warming issue, and it is creating essentially unsafe conditions,” Hammes said.
Hammes said countries must learn from each other, noting that the countries with best air quality, for example, are the ones taking on specific actions to transition away from polluting industries and into greener forms of energy, such as solar and wind.
She adds it is also important to expand air quality monitoring networks, especially in predominantly disadvantaged regions. For instance, despite Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, the IQAir report shows that Ukraine expanded air monitoring networks, collecting data from nearly triple the number of cities in 2022 than in 2021.
“What we’ve learned is that what gets measured gets done,” Hammes said. “We need to collect more data. We need to inform folks of this information, and it does need to be free and available, so that they can make more informed choices.”"
"Water disasters on both ends of the spectrum – dry and wet – are getting more intense as planet warms, study finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/world/water-extremes-drought-floods-nasa-study-climate/index.html,"Water disasters on both ends of the spectrum – dry and wet – are getting more intense as planet warms, study finds
From lengthy droughts to severe flooding, the intensity of water-related disasters around the world has increased over the last two decades as global temperatures climbed to record levels, according to new research.
The study from NASA scientists published Monday in the journal Nature Water found that increasingly frequent, widespread and intense droughts and floods were linked more strongly to higher global temperatures than to naturally changing weather patterns, like El Niño and La Niña. This suggests these intense events will increase as the climate crisis accelerates, the study says.
The study comes as California is slammed with its 11th atmospheric river so far this season – storms that have brought torrential rainfall and crushing snow to a region that for the past several years has been mired in extreme drought. These storms have caused significant flooding, mudslides, collapsed bridges and unusable roads.
While scientists have been predicting climate change will increase the frequency of droughts and floods, it has been tricky to measure.
Matthew Rodell, lead author of the study and hydrologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, looked at 20 years of NASA satellite data from 2002 to 2021, and analyzed the size, duration, and severity – how much wetter or drier it is than normal – of water-related extreme events around the world.
The study identified 505 extreme wet events and 551 extreme dry events during this period, with roughly 70% lasting six months or less and about 10% lasting for more than a year.
The scientists found that these extreme events grew in intensity and frequency since 2015, when the trend of record warm years began.
“We thought, well, maybe this is related to global warming, because we do know the past seven or so years have been the hottest on record,” Rodell told CNN. “Sure enough, there was a significant correlation between this total worldwide intensity of these events and the temperature record.”
Rodell wanted to be certain of this conclusion, so he ran analyses to rule out other climate indicators including El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which is a natural climate pattern that involves sea temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean and affects weather globally.
And in the end, he said the climate change signal was stronger than the other natural indicators.
“What I feel more confident about is that as the world warms, we’re going to see the greater global intensity of all the wet and dry events increase, meaning they’re going to be more frequent, larger and more severe in total,” Rodell said. “What happens in a regional sense is a little bit more difficult to say with certainty.”
Monday’s report found that the most extreme wet event during the study period happened in 2020 in sub-Saharan Africa, where months of intense rain swelled Lake Victoria – Africa’s largest lake – to the highest levels ever recorded. Rising water flooded homes and affected critical infrastructure such as drinking water, healthcare facilities, and hydropower.
The most intense dry event the study recorded was in Brazil and Venezuela from 2015 to 2016, which Rodell said “was about twice as intense” as the current drought in the southwestern US as of the end of 2021. The drought severely threatened hydroelectric power, drained critical reservoirs, and cut crop yields.
Richard Seager, professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, who was not involved with the study, told CNN that the scientists’ use of satellites to analyze water events was a new angle as most studies just measure levels of precipitation or soil moisture.
“This study uses novel data to confirm that human-driven warming is driving the climate system to more extremes of extended both wet and dry episodes,” he said.
UN scientists recently concluded that as the climate changes, droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently; whereas heavy rainfall that used to happen once every 10 years now occurs 30% more often.
While 2022 was not included in the study period, vast swaths of the world saw extreme events last year, including the deadly flooding that submerged a third of Pakistan as well as the severe European drought that caused some rivers to dip to historic lows.
Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and director of the Institute for Environment and Society at Brown University who did not participate in the study, told CNN that the latest research brings “a new lens on our rapidly changing water cycle, linking many of the headlines about droughts, floods and wildfires to this global analysis.”
Dramatic swings between both extremes – periods of drought and high precipitation – also known as weather whiplash is another phenomenon that scientists warn will occur more often under a warming planet in the coming decades.
California, which has been experiencing a historic megadrought triggering severe water shortages, has been suddenly pummeled by heavy rain and snowstorms over the last few months.
“This finding really reinforces the trends that we see from analysis of rainfall data and climate model output, and in that sense adds significant evidence to inform emergency planning and response, infrastructure planning, agricultural practices, and water resource management under continued warming,” Cobb said.
Rodell added he hopes the study will help people realize that every little increase in global temperature matters, and that the world must curb the relentless rise of planet-warming pollution.
“The study is another way for people to recognize that climate change affects everyone,” he said. “It’s not just about the temperature rising on average around the world, it’s the actual weather events that have severe impacts on people that may be increasing in intensity and frequency.”"
"Scientists find a way to suck up carbon pollution, turn it into baking soda and store it in the oceans",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/10/world/carbon-capture-sea-water-climate-intl-scn/index.html,"Scientists find a way to suck up carbon pollution, turn it into baking soda and store it in the oceans
Scientists have set out a way to suck planet-heating carbon pollution from the air, turn it into sodium bicarbonate and store it in oceans, according to a new paper.
The technique could be up to three times more efficient than current carbon capture technology, say the authors of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.
Tackling the climate crisis means drastically reducing the burning of fossil fuels, which releases planet-heating pollution. But because humans have already pumped so much of this pollution into the atmosphere and are unlikely to sufficiently reduce emissions in the near term, scientists say we also need to remove it from the air.
Nature does this – forests and oceans, for example, are valuable carbon sinks – but not quickly enough to keep pace with the amounts humans are producing. So we have turned to technology.
One method is to capture carbon pollution directly at the source, for example from steel or cement plants.
But another way, which this study focuses on, is “direct air capture.” This involves sucking carbon pollution directly out of the atmosphere and then storing it, often by injecting it into the ground.
The problem with direct air capture is that while carbon dioxide may be a very potent planet-heating gas, its concentrations are very small – it makes up about 0.04% of air. This means removing it directly from the air is challenging and expensive.
It’s a “significant hurdle,” Arup SenGupta, a professor at Lehigh University and a study author, told CNN.
Even the biggest facilities can only remove relatively small amounts and it costs several hundred dollars to remove each ton of carbon.
Climeworks’ direct air removal project in Iceland is the largest facility, according to the company, and can capture up to 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. That’s equivalent to the carbon pollution produced by fewer than 800 cars over a year.
The new technique laid out in the study can help tackle those problems, said SenGupta.
The team have used copper to modify the absorbent material used in direct air capture. The result is an absorbent “which can remove CO2 from the atmosphere at ultra-dilute concentration at a capacity which is two to three times greater than existing absorbents,” SenGupta said.
This material can be produced easily and cheaply and would help drive down the costs of direct air capture, he added.
Once the carbon dioxide is captured, it can then be turned into sodium bicarbonate – baking soda – using seawater and released into the ocean at a small concentration.
The oceans “are infinite sinks,” SenGupta said. “If you put all the CO2 from the atmosphere, emitted every day – or every year – into the ocean, the increase in concentration would be very, very minor,” he said.
SenGupta’s idea is that direct air capture plants can be located offshore, giving them access to abundant amounts of seawater for the process.
Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the chemistry was “novel and elegant.”
The process is a modification of one we already know, he said, “which is easier to understand, scale-up and develop than something totally new.”
But there may be regulatory hurdles to surmount. “Disposing of large tonnages of sodium bicarbonate in the ocean could be legally defined as ‘dumping,’ which is banned by international treaties,” Haszeldine said.
Others remain concerned about negative impacts on the oceans, which are already under pressure from climate change, pollution and other human activity.
Peter Styring, professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at the University of Sheffield, told CNN: “Unless you’ve got a full eco-toxic study, then you don’t know what it’s going to do, even at small concentrations.”
Direct air capture also remains expensive and inefficient, Styring said. “This is a big scale problem. Why would you capture from the atmosphere when you’ve got so much coming out of power stations and industrial plants? It just makes sense to go for the high concentrations first,” he said.
Some scientists have expressed concerns that a focus on technology to remove carbon pollution could distract from policies to reduce fossil fuel burning, or could give polluters license to carry on polluting.
But given the scale of the climate crisis, there is a big push from governments and international bodies to scale up this technology.
More research will be needed to understand how the method works at scale, Haszeldine said. But it’s promising, he added, saying “the world needs lots of this type of discovery.”
SenGupta said the technology is ready to be taken out of the lab and trialed. “This is the time to go forward and do something in maybe two or three different places around the world. Let other people get involved, find faults, improve on it, and then proceed accordingly,” he said."
European Union agrees to push for global phase out of fossil fuels ahead of COP28 climate conference,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/10/europe/eu-fossil-fuels-cop28-climate-intl/index.html,"European Union agrees to push for global phase out of fossil fuels ahead of COP28 climate conference
European Union countries agreed to promote a global fossil fuel phase out on Thursday ahead of the United Nation’s COP28 climate summit this year, attempting to boost a global deal that failed at last year’s summit.
Ministers from the 27 EU member states approved a text on their diplomatic priorities ahead of the COP28 summit, which begins on November 30 in Dubai, where nearly 200 countries will attempt to strengthen efforts to rein in climate change.
“The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels,” the EU text said, citing the scientific consensus that this is necessary to avoid more severe climate change.
“The EU will systematically promote and call for a global move towards energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels well ahead of 2050”, it said, adding that global fossil fuel consumption should peak in the near term.
Europe is in the midst of transforming its energy system to meet climate targets and end decades of reliance on Russian fossil fuels.
The text said countries should combine the two aims and use renewable energy or energy savings - rather than fossil fuels – to replace Russian energy.
“There is no need for a one-to-one replacement of former Russian natural gas import volumes,” it said.
Some countries are hoping this year’s COP28 summit could secure a global deal to phase out fossil fuels, which emit planet-heating pollution. They want this to include not only coal, as agreed at previous UN climate talks, but also oil and gas.
More than 80 countries, including the EU, supported an Indian proposal to do this at last year’s summit, but Saudi Arabia and other oil and gas-rich nations opposed it.
EU countries approved their climate text two weeks later than planned, owing to a spat among countries over whether it should promote nuclear energy.
The final version scrubbed some wording that countries had disagreed on, but said that alongside renewable energy, EU diplomacy will promote sustainable “low-carbon technologies” - a phrase that often refers to nuclear energy."
"After a record warm February, winter cold is returning",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/06/weather/cold-snap-march-wxn/index.html,"After a record warm February, winter cold is returning
Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.
For the last several weeks, high temperatures have been breaking records. Many of you may have kissed winter goodbye and already moved on to spring. But don’t get too used to the warmer weather. We could see a huge shift in temperatures next week, and this one won’t be subtle.
The Climate Prediction Center is calling for below-average temperatures for much of the country beginning this weekend and lasting for much of next week, and possibly beyond.
The cold snap could bring snow as far south as the southern Appalachians next week and bring snow into the mid-Atlantic. There’s even a shot of snow for Washington, DC, where some cherry blossoms around the capital are already blooming. Areas seeing little to no snow this winter could make up for some of the deficit during winter’s final breath.
There may be some potential for some snow. “I’m cautiously optimistic for snow lovers for snow to potentially be across the mid-Atlantic and other areas that haven’t seen really any snow at all,” Jon Gottschalk, Branch Chief at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
While the exact temperatures and impacts are still being fine-tuned, the Climate Prediction Center is calling for the Southeast to feel the pendulum swing the most. They are calling for temperatures to run at least 15 degrees below normal, which comes on the heels of temperatures running 15 to 25 degrees above normal during a record warm February.
Here are a few cities that experienced their top five warmest meteorological winters (December 1, 2022, through February 28, 2023):
The warm weather has reached far and wide this year. Aside from the West, who has been experiencing a historic cold and snowy winter, much of the country has been oddly warm.
“Much of the cold has been kept bottled up in the Arctic for much of this year so far, but that appears to be changing and most people in the US will feel it later this week,” CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller explained. “On the positive side, there just isn’t as cold of air in March left to invade the US and bring too much in the way of a deep freeze, like what we saw in late-December.”
The Tennessee Valley will get hit with a big temperature swing, going from the 80s last week to highs in the 40s next week. We could see several mornings with temperatures below freezing, which is a huge concern for agriculture.
“The main impact that we’re concerned with is the vegetation or potential crop losses, if it does come to fruition, because we do expect freezing temperatures to reach pretty far south,” Gottschalk said.
Rusty Mangrum is one of those farmers. He grows hundreds of thousands of plants every year, including fruit trees at his nursery in McMinnville, Tennessee. His trees, like most in the South and mid-South, already think it’s spring.
“A lot of trees are blooming out because of the warm temperatures,” Mangrum said.
He says if the temperature drop does materialize, they have a lot to lose.
“When we get a cold spell below freezing, it will end up killing the blooms, and it won’t produce fruit that year. So, you’ve lost a year’s worth of fruit really,” Mangrum explained.
He said his plants could still produce fruit if the cold snap is short-lived, but if the cold lasts more than a day, it could not only be trouble for the farmers, but for the consumers as well.
Keep up with the latest forecast here
We will keep watching the forecast and the cold weather ahead, but in the meantime, we have a few more days of warm temperatures.
“Highs are expected to soar into the 70s this afternoon as far north as the Ohio Valley, with 80s across the Deep South and southern Plains,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “These warm temperatures could break several daily record highs.”
By midweek, heavy rain will fall across the southern Plains. We could see showers and thunderstorms from North Texas to Arkansas. The rain is expected to linger for much of the week, due to a stalled frontal boundary.
“This will lead to the chances for scattered flash floods, particularly over parts of central/eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas on Tuesday night,” said the prediction center.
By the latter part of the week, cooler temperatures will settle into the east. Gusty winds will help temperatures feel even cooler, and this should signal a shift to end the record warmth across much of the east.

"As the West’s drought eases, this area remains in the worst on record — and it’s hitting farmers hard",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/04/us/oregon-drought-water-shortages-farming-climate/index.html,"As the West’s drought eases, this area remains in the worst on record — and it’s hitting farmers hard
Cate Casad started noticing the for-sale signs pop up over the last year on farms around Central Oregon, which has been mired in water shortages amid a yearslong megadrought.
Casad and her husband, Chris, are first-generation farmers and ranchers who started off with just a few acres of land east of Bend, then moved north in 2017 to scale up their farm. Now, the couple manages around 360 acres of farmland in Jefferson County, where they grow organic food and raise cattle, heritage breed hogs and pastured chickens.
Only a year after that move, they started experiencing the impact of the drought and water cuts so severe that they made the tough decision to stop growing potatoes — a valuable crop that took them nine years to build a local market for.
But while Casad is determined to keep farming, neighboring farms have decided to cut their losses and sell land.
“It’s devastating,” Casad told CNN. “Each year since then, we’ve been cutting back more and more and more to the point in which last year was the worst year yet — and this year, we think will be very similar.”
As much-needed winter storms alleviate drought conditions in California and southern parts of Oregon, the deluge of snow and rain in the West largely missed Central Oregon, leaving Crook, Jefferson and Deschutes counties dry. And many of the farmers in this area don’t have priority rights to the water – putting their farms at heightened risk of failure.
Around the peak of the western drought in the summer of 2021, nearly 300,000 square miles of the West was in exceptional drought, the worst designation in the US Drought Monitor. Comprising 10 states — every state in the West except Wyoming — this designation covered one-quarter of all the land.
But now the exceptional drought has nearly disappeared after a winter deluge of rain and snow — all except for about 1,500 square miles, nearly all contained in Crook County. It has spent 87 consecutive weeks mired in the worst drought category — the longest current stretch anywhere in the country.
Oregon state climatologist Larry O’Neill said Crook missed out on a full year’s worth of rain over the last three years and “by several different measures” has seen the worst drought in Oregon’s recorded history.
“What we’re seeing now is this really poor water supply and how we haven’t really had any recharge in the last couple years,” O’Neill said. “Even if you stretch back to the year 2000 in that region of Central Oregon, 16 out of the last 22 years have received below-average precipitation.”
Seth Crawford, a county judge in Crook, said most of the ranches and farms there rely on reservoir water, “and those reservoirs levels are at historic lows.” Farmers are seeing reductions in harvest yields and have had to shift to crops that require less water, which tend to be less valuable. And then their expenses pile up.
“Our ranchers and farmers have had to sell livestock which will result in a negative effect on their bottom line,” Crawford told CNN, and they “are hauling water to locations where, historically, livestock water was provided by springs and pond. In addition to the issues that farmers and ranchers deal with, our rural residents are needing assistance in well-deepening and water quality.”
The impact of the last remaining exceptional drought in the West spreads beyond Crook County’s borders. Early this year, officials in both Crook and Jefferson counties declared a drought emergency for the fourth year in a row, and two months earlier than last year.
After weeks of urging from local officials, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in mid-February declared a state-level drought emergency for the counties, which could open the door for federal drought-relief funds.
“If things don’t course correct, we’re on a path to see a massive rural depopulation of these areas, because it can’t farm without water,” Casad said.
A shift in farming practices
Spring Alaska Schreiner, who is Inupiaq and a member of the Valdez Native Tribe of Alaska, bought a few acres in Deschutes County just 20 minutes outside of Bend in 2018.
Schreiner’s tribal name, Upingaksraq, means “the time when the ice breaks” — fitting, considering during her first year of owning Sakari Farm, hail storms destroyed the greenhouses and the plants inside. Then in 2020, the megadrought intensified.
“As soon as we got the farm, [during] the first year, the climate had changed,” she told CNN. “We were seeing winters occurring later in the season. Like right now, we’re finally getting some snow but it’s March almost, and that’s just weird.”
In 2021, reservoir levels in Central Oregon began to drop. Crescent Lake, which supplements water storage for the creek that Schreiner’s irrigation district pulls water from, dropped to 50% of capacity that year, which was the record lowest level at the time. That year, Sakari Farm and the rest of the junior water right holders like Casad started facing water cuts.
With just half of its normal water allocation and later, the water being shut off biweekly, Schreiner said the farm — which grows native plants and seeds from Indigenous peoples which are then donated to other tribes — had to remove crops.
“We can’t not water for a week because we had anywhere between 80 and 130 varieties of plants — it’s a very unique vegetable farm,” she said. “So, what we did was we started shutting off water in parts of the farm and we had to prioritize which crops to grow or to let die, basically.”
As of Friday, Crescent Lake was only 9% full. And given the measly amount of precipitation the region has received in recent months, the impacts of the drought are still strongly felt at Schreiner’s farm. But she said the farm has had to be creative to stay afloat during the drought, including controlling what and how much is grown, who gets its food and how it rations water and food resources.
And with the help of some federal funding from the US Department of Agriculture, she plans to switch the whole farm to drip irrigation, a method that delivers water more directly to the roots of plants and can reduce water waste from evaporation and runoff. She’s also looking to install weather stations and water sensors to gather data that will help the farm improve plant growth efficiency.
“We’re doing everything we can this year, and there’s nothing else you can do,” Schreiner said. “After that, you just start taking more crops away, which is income.”

Century-old water laws
Watching family-run farms suffer — and then ultimately sell their land — weighs heavily on Casad. Even some of the oldest homesteads in Oregon, she said, are exploring plans to put their farms up for sale due to water scarcity.
“There are some days that weight can feel heavier than others,” Casad said. And while she attributes these dire water challenges to the drought, she also blames the century-old water laws.
Like the drought-plagued Colorado River Basin, Oregon water laws are based on seniority – those who were among the first to claim land or water rights have priority over those that followed.
“While we’re all experiencing drought, not all drought is equal due to this 100-year-old Western water law that’s been put in place and hasn’t been changed, and that’s serving people very inequitably,” Andrea Smith, agricultural support manager with High Desert Food and Farm Alliance, told CNN. “But it is a system we’re dealt and working with right now – and there’s a lot we have to do to change it.”
While Crook County may be driest county in Oregon, the system is such that junior water right holders like Casad and Schreiner, in Jefferson and Deschutes counties, get the short end of the stick.
But even Crook County ranchers, some of which Smith said do hold senior rights, are struggling with water scarcity. Casad said she has spoken with ranchers there who have had to haul water to their cattle because the springs have yet to fully return and make up for the yearslong water deficit.
Others, according to Casad, have packed up and moved to Eastern Oregon, where the conditions are becoming more viable than their old land.
Natalie Danielson, the administrative director at Friends of Family Farmers, said she believes the main water scarcity issue is the unfair distribution of water. If the 100-year-old system changes, she said there may be enough water for everyone in Central Oregon.
“We’re kind of at this turning point where there may be enough water, but we are locked in systems that don’t allow for getting that water to the people who need it,” Danielson told CNN. The drought just puts “more pressure on the system that wasn’t set up to be resilient in these conditions.”
As the climate crisis creates a hotter and drier future in the West, Casad said people need to start rethinking how land is managed, while preparing to make tough and painful decisions.
Farmers have always been incredibly resilient, Casad said. “This is not the first time we have faced insane climactic challenges and it won’t be the last.”"
Climate advocates are rallying against the Willow Project. The White House is eyeing concessions to soften the blow,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/willow-project-petition-concessions-biden-climate/index.html,"Climate advocates are rallying against the Willow Project. The White House is eyeing concessions to soften the blow
With just days to go until the Biden administration is set to a release a decision on the first major oil drilling project of its tenure, the White House has indicated it may reduce the scope of the controversial project that has drawn fierce criticism from climate advocates.
The Willow Project, proposed by ConocoPhillips, is a massive and decades-long oil drilling venture on Alaska’s North Slope that the state’s lawmakers say will create jobs and boost domestic energy production. Its supporters say Willow could be a much-needed new source of revenue for the region.
But environmental groups have remained staunchly opposed to it, fearing the effect of the planet-warming carbon pollution from the hundreds of millions of barrels of oil it would produce. Young voters have rallied on social media against the proposal with the hashtag #StopWillow in posts that have amassed tens of millions of views. A petition to “say no the willow project” on Change.org has more than 1.6 million signatures and continues to grow.
They say the approval of Willow will deal a significant blow to President Joe Biden’s climate credibility after he pledged in his campaign to end new oil drilling on federal land.
By the administration’s own estimates, the project would generate enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year – equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads. Over the course of 30 years, climate groups have estimated it would release around 278 million metric tons of carbon pollution, which is more than what 70 coal-fired power plants could produce every year.
In a move to assuage the criticism, the Biden administration is looking at reducing the number of approved drilling pads from three to two and offering to boost nature conservation measures elsewhere in the state, according to two sources familiar with the details of the plan.
White House officials are considering cutting the most ecologically sensitive drill site of the three, one source said. And in a final environmental impact statement, the administration described how it would plant trees to mitigate carbon emissions from the project and move some drilling infrastructure to protect local loon habitat.
A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the discussions. A final decision on Willow is expected next week.
The concessions are not going over well with environmental groups – while at the same time enraging Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation.
“I don’t see people rejoicing in the climate community over any amount of drill pads being opened up in the petroleum reserve,” one climate advocate who has been engaged with the White House in recent weeks told CNN.
On Wednesday, Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native in Congress, slammed the idea of reducing drill pads to appease environmental groups.
“If they go to two pads, we have told them we will view it 100% as a full denial,” Sullivan said. “Conoco has made it clear it would not be economically viable, and we have warned the White House: Don’t try to be cute.”
No matter where the administration ultimately lands on the massive oil project, it could face lawsuits from multiple sides that could hold the project up further.
ConocoPhillips could pursue legal options if the drill pad sites are reduced. ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss said the company is waiting to see a final decision on the project before it shares next steps.
Environmental legal group Earthjustice has been preparing a lawsuit against the project if it is approved. That won’t change – even if the number of drilling pads is reduced – said Jeremy Lieb, a senior attorney for Earthjustice.
“I think that litigation is very likely,” Lieb, who is based in Alaska, told CNN. “We and our clients don’t see any acceptable version of this project.”
#StopWillow
For climate groups that have been celebrating monumental wins in Congress under Biden, the Willow project represents a galvanizing moment of a different kind.
The League of Conservation Voters last month launched six-figure television and digital ad campaign urging Biden to reject Willow.
LCV’s senior vice president of government affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld told CNN her group is not negotiating with the Biden administration for a reduced number of drill pads; they still want to see the project canceled.
“It clearly flies in the face of both his incredible climate accomplishments to date and his goal of cutting climate pollution in half by 2030,” Sittenfeld said. “Such significant swaths of the coalition that supports him are deeply opposed, and we’re seeing that this is incredibly galvanizing for young people.”
And activism against the project has surged on social media, with 50 million direct views of #StopWillow videos on TiKTok alone in recent weeks.
Climate advocates say that as Biden gears up for the 2024 election, a decision to approve Willow could risk alienating a base of young voters. It could also galvanize a widespread movement against a new fossil fuel project, like the resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline during the Obama administration.
“There’s a specific thing happening in a physical place; I think it makes it feel more real,” said Jamal Raad, co-founder and executive director for climate and clean energy group Evergreen Action. “I do not see one new voter for the Biden administration for approving the largest American oil extraction on public lands.”
‘Cooperation goes both ways’
The politics of the huge Alaska drilling project are messy – both inside and outside the Biden administration.
The Willow project has been under consideration since the Trump administration, which initially planned on approving it with a larger scope. The Biden administration has pursued the project with a smaller footprint.
It has sparked controversy even within the administration; when the Bureau of Land Management in Alaska released its preferred alternative of three drill pads last month, the US Department of the Interior put out a statement saying it had “substantial concerns” with the project, “including direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to wildlife and Alaska Native subsistence.”
Alaska Natives are divided on the project. While the project has been largely opposed by the nearby Alaska Native village of Nuiqsut – which some villagers evacuated last year during a gas leak from another ConocoPhillips project in the area – it has garnered support from other Alaska Native tribes and officials who want the jobs and revenue the project could bring to the North Slope, which could boost the basic services for people that live there.
Nagruk Harcharek, president of the advocacy group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, said Tuesday the project has “majority consensus” among Alaska Natives on the North Slope.
“We utilize the jobs that projects like this provide,” he said. “[They] provide income for the families on the North Slope”
Harcharek also said he doesn’t believe the project would negatively affect subsistence hunting for animals, including whale and caribou.
“As the subsistence hunters of the North Slope, we would not support a project that threatened our subsistence livelihood,” Harcharek said, adding that subsistence hunting and resource development “are not mutually exclusive.”
“When you talk about environmental justice and protecting the environment, us Alaska natives are part of that environment,” Alaska state Rep. Josiah Patkotak, who has no party affiliation, said on Tuesday. “We’re asking the president, his Cabinet, all those involved in the decision-making process to keep that in mind.”
A final decision on the project is expected next week. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre last month said the final decision on Willow rests with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. But ultimately, environmental advocates and lawmakers like Murkowski told CNN they believe the White House – not Interior – will make the final decision on whether to approve Willow.
Peltola, Murkowski and Sullivan have been asking White House staff to meet with Biden directly about the project, Murkowski told CNN – a meeting request that so far has not been added to the president’s calendar. Murkowski told CNN that if that happens after a Willow decision is released, “That’s pretty rude, I think.”
“It’s not any great state secret that I have been a cooperative Republican with this administration,” Murkowski told CNN. “Cooperation goes both ways.”

"Boreal forests could be a planet-warming ‘time bomb’ as wildfires expand, says new study",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/world/boreal-forest-fires-study-climate-scn-intl/index.html,"Boreal forests could be a planet-warming ‘time bomb’ as wildfires expand, says new study
The world’s most northerly forests could be a “time bomb” of planet-warming pollution as expanding wildfires have released record high levels of planet-heating pollution into the atmosphere, according to a new study.
Using new satellite data analysis techniques, researchers found that, since 2000, summer wildfires have expanded in boreal forests, which wrap around the northernmost parts of the Earth.
Boreal forest fires usually make up 10% of global wildfire-related carbon pollution. But in 2021, their contribution soared to 23%, according to the study, as extreme drought and heatwaves in Siberia and Canada helped drive intense fires.
“Boreal forests could be a time bomb of carbon, and the recent increases in wildfire emissions we see make me worry the clock is ticking,” said study author Steven Davis, a professor of earth system science at the University of California at Irvine, in a press release.
These forests, which cover huge swaths of Canada, Russia and Alaska, are the world’s largest land biome. They are also carbon dense, releasing 10 to 20 times more planet-heating carbon pollution for each unit of area burned by wildfires than other ecosystems, according to the study.
Boreal forests are one of the fastest warming biomes on Earth, and warmer and drier fire seasons are contributing to expanding wildfires.
Russia’s Siberian region experienced particularly bad wildfires in 2021 which burned nearly 45 million acres (18.16 million hectares) of Russian forest in 2021.
In July that year, reconnaissance pilot Svyatoslav Kolesov told CNN he couldn’t fly his plane in the far eastern Russian region of Yukutia because smoke from the fires was so thick.
The region is prone to wildfires and much of the land is covered in forests, but Kolesov said something has changed.
“New fires have appeared in the north of Yakutia, in places where there were no fires last year and where it had not burned at all before,” he said.
Wildfires are becoming larger and more intense and they are also happening in places that aren’t used to such extreme fires. The situation is likely to worsen as temperatures rise, study author Bo Zheng, an assistant professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told CNN via email.
Higher temperatures encourage the growth of vegetation, which then becomes exceptionally dry during heatwaves, increasing the risk of wildfires.
“We are facing dangerous positive feedback between climate and boreal fires,” Zheng said.
“Heatwaves and droughts are likely to occur more frequently over the boreal region, and the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires like those in 2021 are likely to increase, with the release of CO2 emissions in turn leading to further global warming,” he added.
Jeff Wells, the vice president for boreal conservation at the conservation organization National Audubon Society, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that he was not surprised that the study had found such a high level of carbon pollution from boreal fires. But, he said, “the size of the spike in 2021 is shocking.”
The findings are “yet another stark warning” of the need to “drastically reduce CO2 emissions,” Wells said.
Wells also pointed to the role Indigenous communities play in protecting forests and peatlands.
“It is time the world recognizes the leadership and knowledge of Indigenous peoples and their governments in the boreal and across the world in stewarding their traditional territories, especially in the face of the increase in the size and frequency of wildfires,” said Wells."
"SUVs produced more planet-heating pollution than most countries last year, new figures show",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/world/suv-cars-emissions-iea-climate-intl/index.html,"SUVs produced more planet-heating pollution than most countries last year, new figures show
While global car sales might have fallen in 2022, one type of car, with an especially large climate footprint, had a great year: The SUV.
Last year sports utility vehicles accounted for nearly half of all cars sold, with particular growth in the US, India and Europe, according to the International Energy Agency.
This boom comes at a climate cost.
The amount of planet-heating carbon pollution produced by the 330 million SUVs now on the world’s roads rose to around 1 billion tons in 2022. To put that in perspective, if SUVs were a country, they would easily be in the top 10 world’s highest carbon-polluters.
There was some good news for electric cars. While car markets in general shrunk due to factors including supply chain shortages and inflation, electric cars bucked the trend.
Last year, global electric car sales rose by about 60%, exceeding 10 million for the first time, according to the IEA. More than a quarter of cars sold in China were electric, one in five in the European Union and nearly one in 10 in the US.
However, the big increase in electric cars was not enough to offset the growing carbon-pollution impact of SUVs, the majority of which are gas-powered.
These heavier vehicles are less fuel efficient than smaller cars, on average consuming about 20% more fuel than the average medium-sized car, according to the IEA.
While the number of electric SUVs is increasing – last year they made up more than half of global electric car sales and 16% of total SUV sales – they also come with problems. Their bigger batteries require more materials such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which adds to pressure on supply chains.
“Carmakers are culling small cars in pursuit of profit,” Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at Transport & Environment, told CNN by email. “But larger cars put more pressure on the planet as they need more materials and energy,” she added.
“For drivers, this means more expensive models and higher running costs, especially at a time of high energy prices. Ultimately, Western carmakers might come to regret this,” Poliscanova said.
The IEA called for or car makers to decrease the average car size and invest in battery technologies. “Rapidly increasing the number of electric cars on the road in place of conventional cars is a key part of reaching net zero emissions by mid-century,” it said."
Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Here’s how to reduce your use,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/world/ways-to-save-water-climate-environmental-benefits-wellness-scn-lbg/index.html,"Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Here’s how to reduce your use
Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.
The reliability of our faucets providing water every time we turn them on can make water seem like a magical, never-ending resource.
But abusing the availability of this finite resource can contribute to water scarcity and harm our capacity to deal with the impact of the climate crisis.
“Four billion people today already live in places that are affected by water scarcity at least part of the year,” said Rick Hogeboom, executive director of the Water Footprint Network, an international knowledge center based in the Netherlands. “Climate change will have a worsening influence on the demand-supply balance,” he said.
“If all people were to conserve water in some way, that would help ease some of the immediate impacts seen from the climate crisis,” said Shanika Whitehurst, associate director of sustainability for Consumer Reports’ research and testing. Consumer Reports is a nonprofit that helps consumers evaluate goods and services.
“Unfortunately, there has been a great toll taken on our surface and groundwater sources, so conservation efforts would more than likely have to be employed long term for there to be a more substantial effect.”
Yes, businesses and governments should play a part in water conservation by, respectively, producing goods “water efficiently” and allocating water in a sustainable, equitable way, Hogeboom said.
But “addressing the multifaceted water crises is a shared responsibility. No one actor can solve it, nor is there a silver bullet,” he added. “We need all actors to play their part.”
Contrary to what you might think, the water used directly in and around the home makes up a minor portion of the total water footprint of a consumer, Hogeboom said.
“The bulk — typically at least 95% — is indirect water use, water use that is hidden in the products we buy, the clothes we wear and the food we eat,” Hogeboom said. “Cotton, for instance, is a very thirsty crop.”
Of the 300-plus gallons of water the average American family uses every day at home, however, roughly 70% of this use occurs indoors, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency — making the home another important place to start cutting your use.
Here are some ways to reduce your water footprint as you move from room to room and outdoors.
How to save water in the kitchen
Since the kitchen involves dishwashing, cooking and one of the biggest water guzzlers — your diet — it’s a good place to start.
An old kitchen faucet can release 1 to 3 gallons of water per minute when running at full blast, according to Consumer Reports. Instead of rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, scrape food into your trash or compost bin. Make sure your dishwasher is fully loaded so you only do as many wash cycles as necessary and make the most use of the water.
With some activities you can save water by not only using less but also upgrading the appliances that deliver the water. Dishwashers certified by Energy Star, the government-backed symbol for energy efficiency, are about 15% more water-efficient than standard models, according to Consumer Reports.
If you do wash dishes by hand, plug up the sink or use a wash basin so you can use a limited amount of water instead of letting the tap run.
If you plan on eating frozen foods, thaw them in the fridge overnight instead of running water over them. For drinking, keep a pitcher of water in the fridge instead of running the faucet until the water’s cool — and if you need to do that to get hot water, collect the cold water and use it to water plants.
Cook foods in as little water as possible, which can also retain flavor, according to the University of Toronto Scarborough’s department of physical and environmental sciences.
When it comes to saving water via what you eat, generally animal products are more water-intensive than plant-based alternatives, Hogeboom said.
“Go vegetarian or even better vegan,” he added. “If you insist on meat, replace red meat by pig or chicken, which has a lower water footprint than beef.”
It takes more than 1,800 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef, Consumer Reports’ Whitehurst said.
How to save water in the bathroom
The bathroom is the largest consumer of indoor water, as the toilet alone can use 27% of household water, according to the EPA. You can cut use here by following this adage: “If it’s yellow, let it mellow. If it’s brown, flush it down.”
“Limiting the amount of toilet flushes — as long as it is urine — is not problematic for hygiene,” Whitehurst said. “However, you do have to watch the amount of toilet paper to avoid clogging your pipes. If there is solid waste or feces, then flush the toilet immediately to avoid unsanitary conditions.”
Older toilets use between 3.5 and 7 gallons of water per flush, but WaterSense-labeled toilets use up to 60% less. WaterSense is a partnership program sponsored by the EPA.
“There’s probably more to gain by having dual flush systems so you don’t waste gallons for small flushes,” Hogeboom said.
By turning off the sink tap when you brush your teeth, shave or wash your face, you can save more than 200 gallons of water monthly, according to the EPA.
Cut water use further by limiting showers to five minutes and eliminating baths. Shower with your partner when you can. Save even more water by turning it off when you’re shampooing, shaving or lathering up, Consumer Reports suggests.
Replacing old sink faucets or showerheads with WaterSense models can save hundreds of gallons of water per year.
How to save water in the laundry room
Laundry rooms account for nearly a fourth of household water use, according to the EPA. Traditional washing machines can use 50 gallons of water or more per load, but newer energy- and water-conserving machines use less than 27 gallons per load.
You can also cut back by doing full loads (but not overstuffing) and choosing the appropriate water level and soil settings. Doing the latter two can help high-efficiency machines use only the water that’s needed. If you have a high-efficiency machine, use HE detergent or measure out regular detergent, which is more sudsy and, if too much is used, can cause the machine to use more water, according to Consumer Reports.
How to save water outdoors
Nationally, outdoor water use accounts for 30% of household use, according to the EPA. This percentage can be much higher in drier parts of the country and in more water-intensive landscapes, particularly in the West.
If you prefer to have a landscape, reduce your outdoor use by planting only plants appropriate for your climate or ones that are low-water and drought-resistant.
“If maintained properly, climate-appropriate landscaping can use less than one-half the water of a traditional landscape,” the EPA says.
The biggest water consumers outside are automatic irrigation systems, according to the EPA. To use only what’s necessary, adjust irrigation controllers at least once per month to account for weather changes. WaterSense irrigation controllers monitor weather and landscape conditions to water plants only when needed."
"Dry canals, low rivers and shrunken lakes: Europe braces for severe drought amid winter heatwave",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/24/europe/europe-winter-drought-rivers-climate-intl/index.html,"Dry canals, low rivers and shrunken lakes: Europe braces for severe drought amid winter heatwave
A winter heatwave, record low levels of rain and a startling lack of snow in Europe are pushing rivers, canals and lakes across the continent to alarmingly low levels, with experts warning there could be repeat of last year’s severe droughts.
Images of dried-up river beds and shrunken lakes are usually associated with the scorching heat of summer – not the winter. But an exceptionally warm and dry start to the year is affecting a swath of Europe, including central and southwest France, northern Spain and northern Italy.
There are concerns for what this might mean for water supplies.
Europe’s water situation has become “very precarious,” according to a study published in January by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria, which used satellite data to analyze the world’s groundwater resources.
“A few years ago, I would never have imagined that water would be a problem here in Europe,” said Torsten Mayer-Gürr, one of the researchers. “We are actually getting problems with the water supply here – we have to think about this.”
Record-breaking dry spell in France
France, which is experiencing its driest stretch in more than 60 years, may soon bring in water restrictions.
The country “suffered a series of 32 consecutive days without any significant rainfall from January 21 to February 21,” Simon Mittelberger, a climatologist at Météo-France, told CNN – the longest stretch since records began in 1959.
It is having  a damaging effect on the country’s rivers and lakes, Mittelberger said, as well as the country’s soils.
“Soils are much drier than usual,” he said. France’s current soil moisture levels would not normally be seen until mid-April.
Snowfall has also been low. “The situation in the Pyrenees is close to the lowest record of snow quantity for that time of year,” Mittelberger said. The Alps have seen 63% less snow than usual, according to CIMA Research Foundation.
A lack of snow in the winter can threaten water reserves in the spring and summer, as there is less snowmelt to sustain rivers.
Last summer, France suffered its worst drought on record but, Mittelberger warned, this year “the situation could be worse if we don’t have significant rainfall in the next couple of months.”
Christophe Béchu, the minister for ecological transition, called the winter drought “unprecedented,” and warned the country is in a state of alert.
Exposed lake beds and dried up canals
In Italy, some of country’s most famous bodies of water are drying up.
Water levels at Lake Garda are so low that it is now possible to walk to an island in the middle, along a strip of exposed lake bed. A few months ago, this walkway did not exist.
It is now also a lot harder to take a water taxi in Venice, as some of its canals have become too shallow to keep gondolas afloat, in part, because of a lack of rainfall.
The city which has long feared flooding is now grappling with the opposite problem.
Italy’s longest river, the Po, which winds through its northern agricultural heartland, has 61% less water than usual for this time of year.
Last summer, the Italian government declared a state of emergency for the area surrounding the Po, which experienced its worst drought in 70 years.
Giorgio Zampetti, general manager of Legambiente, an Italian environmental group, fears that the worst is yet to come: “2023 has just begun, but it is showing worrying signs in terms of extreme weather events [and] drought levels,” he said in a press statement.
Fears for water supplies
In Spain, which experienced its hottest year on record last year, there are concerns about water supplies.
“We cannot guarantee water supply for drinking water or for economic uses by relying exclusively on rain,” Teresa Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition recently said at a press conference.
The country has approved plans to invest around $24 billion in water management, including measures to improve sanitation and treatment and modernize irrigation.
Since 1980 the average available water has decreased by 12%, with projections that there may be a further decrease of up to 40% by 2050.
Dry weather in Spain is also threatening the country’s prized jamón ibérico bellota, as low rainfall and rising temperatures affect the acorns eaten by the pigs.
“The coming weeks will be crucial”
While Europe has previously been blighted by summer droughts, experts fear the exceptionally dry last two months may signal a new reality, caused in part by rising average global temperatures.
“These conditions were rare in the past, but climate change is altering precipitation regimes over Europe and making these extremes more recurrent and intense,” Andrea Toreti, a climatologist at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, told CNN.
“There is a growing concern due to the lack of precipitation in the last weeks and also considering the 2022 drought. The coming weeks will be crucial,” Torerti said.
While Toreti said attributing the winter drought to climate change would require a specific analysis that has not yet been conducted, he added such events “are an expected effect of climate change in terms of more frequent and intense extremes.”"
It’s never been this warm in February. Here’s why that’s not a good thing,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/us/early-spring-record-warmth-impacts-climate/index.html,"It’s never been this warm in February. Here’s why that’s not a good thing
As parts of the West and Northern US face a winter storm with blizzard conditions and significant snowfall, much of the rest of the country is experiencing a summer-like heat that has never been felt before during the month of February.
More than 130 cities from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes could set new records for daily and monthly high temperatures this week. Highs will climb up to 80 degrees as far north as Ohio and West Virginia — certainly unusual, but becoming less so in the warming climate.
Here’s a stark example: Before this decade, Charleston, West Virginia, had only hit 80 degrees before March three times in more than 100 years of record-keeping. But this week’s incredible warmth will mean that four of the last six years will have logged temperatures of 80 degrees, which is its normal high on June 1, in February.
Record warmth in February — a time that’s supposed to still feel like winter — might not sound like such a bad thing, but its negative consequences spread across the plant world, sports, tourism and agriculture. And it is another clear sign that our planet is warming rapidly, experts say.
“Whenever we get these events, we should always be thinking there’s the possibility or likelihood that human-induced climate change is increasing the likelihood of strange weather,” Richard Seager, climate researcher at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, told CNN. “The more it goes on, the more they can bring such tremendous damage.”
Deadly thin ice
On the Great Lakes, ice coverage reached a record low for this time of the year — the same time that the annual maximum extent of ice usually occurs. As of last week, only 7% of the five freshwater lakes were covered in ice, a sharp difference from the 35 to 40% ice cover typically expected in mid-to-late February, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Great Lakes ice is on a downward trend, NOAA scientists report. A recent study found a 70% decline in the lakes’ ice cover between 1973 and 2017.
The decline in Great Lakes ice each winter may not seem like it has any harmful impact, but that ice acts as a buffer for large, wind-driven waves in the winter, scientists have reported. Without the ice, the coastlines are more susceptible to erosion and flooding.
Ayumi Fujisaki-Manome, a research scientist at NOAA’s Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research at the University of Michigan, said low ice coverage could also set the stage for another severe lake-effect snow storm like the one Buffalo, New York, experienced in December.
“The moisture and heat from the lake surface water are absorbed into the atmosphere by storm systems, and then fall back to the ground as snow in the winter,” Fujisaki-Manome said in a statement.
The thin ice has already had deadly consequences in New England.
At Vermont’s Lake Champlain, the annual ice fishing tournament was cancelled last weekend when three fishermen died after falling through the ice. One man’s body was found hours after he was expected to return home from the lake, while the other two died after their utility vehicle broke through the ice.
Montpelier, Vermont, had its warmest January on record this year since 1948, with Burlington recording its fifth warmest January since 1884, according to the Burlington National Weather Service.
Robert Wilson, a professor of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said the Northeast as a whole is now a “fast-warming region,” with winter seasons warming faster than summers due to the climate crisis.
And he underscored how this trend is threatening some of New England’s most cherished winter activities.
“In coming decades, winter — as most people understand it — will get shorter and warmer, with less snow and more rain,” Wilson said. “This poses a serious threat to winter recreation: snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, and downhill skiing.”
The risk to food crops
Plants are blooming way earlier than usual across much of the country, a clear sign that spring is either right around the corner — or it has already arrived, in some places.
“Spring is coming early in much of the Southern and Eastern US,” Brad Rippey, meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture, told CNN. “Here in the mid-Atlantic, that means everything from budding trees to crocuses in bloom to spring peepers making lots of noise — and in February, no less.”
Many plants species — including daffodils, witch-hazel, forsythia and even cherry blossoms — are beginning to leaf out in the East. Theresa Crimmins, director of the USA National Phenology Network, said it’s the plants responding to very early warm temperatures.
“Plants, especially those of temperate systems, respond to a number of cues in order to wake up in the spring, including exposure to chill in the winter, exposure to warmth in the spring, and day length,” she told CNN.
If another cold snap occurs after an early warm spell, Crimmins said it could be disruptive and damaging for the plants’ cycle. As flower buds develop, many species lose their ability to tolerate cold temperatures, which means a freeze could kill blooms and leave fruit crops and other commodities vulnerable to spring freezes.
Rippey said warm winters followed by a spring freeze has become more common in recent years. In 2017, for instance, a severe spring freeze in March damaged several fruit crops — peaches, blueberries, apples and strawberries — in states including Georgia and South Carolina, which carried an economic toll of roughly $1.2 billion.
“As nice as it feels to have temperatures in the 70s and 80s this time of year, the fact that it’s not ‘normal’ can have a profound impact on the ecosystem,” Rippey said. “Even a typical spring freeze can damage commercial and back-yard fruit crops that have been pushed into blooming by late-winter warmth.”
This isn’t just a US problem
India issued its first heatwave alert, with temperatures in some states reaching 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) – up to 9 degrees Celsius (16.2 Fahrenheit) above normal, according to data released by the India Meteorological Department on Monday.
“The heatwave warnings as early as February is a scary situation,” Krishna AchutaRao, a professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, told CNN.
It has raised fears of a repeat of last year’s deadly heatwave, which scorched swaths of India and Pakistan.
Blistering heat has devastating consequences for people’s health, for water supplies and for crops; last year, crop yields were reduced by as much as a third in some parts of the country. As temperatures soared last spring, India banned exports of wheat, dashing hopes that the world’s second-largest wheat producer would fill the supply gap caused by the war in Ukraine.
This February, with high temperatures hitting wheat-producing states, including Rajasthan and Gujarat, India has set up a committee to monitor the impact of rising temperatures on the crop, according to Reuters.
Europe, too, has seen unusually high temperatures, kicking off 2023 with an extreme winter heatwave that broke January temperature records in several countries. Low levels of snow and rainfall have fueled concerns about the region’s rivers and lakes.
The River Po, which winds through northern Italy’s agricultural heartland, fed by snow from the Alps and rainfall in the spring, is at very low levels, while water in Lake Garda in northern Italy has reached record lows. There are fears Italy, which declared a state of emergency last year after its worst drought in 70 years, may face another drought.
The unusually warm weather has also left ski resorts across the Alps with little or no snow. In February, top skiers wrote an open letter to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation demanding action on the climate crisis.
“The seasons have shifted,” they wrote. “Our sport is threatened existentially.”
While ski resorts have adapted to warming by relying on artificial snow – a process that uses a lot of water and energy – Wilson noted that resorts would still need cold nighttime temperatures to make it.
“The long-term survival of skiing and other winter recreation will depend on nations lowering their carbon emissions to avoid the more dire consequences and severe warming in the future,” he said.

A powerful winter storm set record low temperatures in the northern Plains of the US, while a heat wave in the Southeast set record highs for the month of February – leaving the country with an unusually stark temperature difference of more than 100 degrees.
Much of Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas had temperatures below zero Wednesday afternoon, including minus 9 degrees in Cut Bank, Montana. At the same time, much of the South, from Texas to the Carolinas, had afternoon temperatures above 80 degrees, including a scorching 95 in McAllen, Texas.
The extreme cold in the North is just one aspect of the coast-to-coast storm bringing heavy snow, high winds and ice on Wednesday, putting parts of more than two dozen states under winter weather alerts as travel conditions begin to deteriorate in some areas.
More than 65 million people across 29 states, from as far west as California to Minnesota through Maine, were under winter weather alerts as of Wednesday morning, including warnings of severe icing, extreme cold and sleet that are likely to make travel dangerous and knock out power to some.
The Upper Midwest is expected to bear the brunt of the storm in terms of snowfall, with the Minneapolis area likely getting more than 20 inches Wednesday and more than 2 feet over the multiday storm – potentially the most in 30 years.
The Twin Cities reported 3 to 5 inches of snow Wednesday morning, and a second round of snow and high winds is expected at night into Thursday morning, making for life-threatening travel conditions, the National Weather Service said. The Minnesota Department of Transportation announced Wednesday afternoon that various state highways and I-90 are closed due to blizzard conditions and poor visibility.
But it’s more than just snow. An ice storm warning is in place for more than 9 million people across a stretch from Iowa to southern Michigan. Also, significant icing is possible for the mid-Atlantic by late Wednesday; a severe weather threat and high winds are possible from Oklahoma to Missouri; and flooding is likely from heavy rain in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
And more than 2 million were under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas.
Meanwhile, warm weather prevailed in parts of the South and a few other areas. More than 30 high-temperature records for the calendar day were broken, including Nashville, Tennessee (80 degrees), Mobile, Alabama (82), Charleston, West Virginia (78), and Cincinnati (72).
The Southeast generally saw temperatures in the 70s and 80s -- a stark contrast to the frigid conditions further north.
Out west, strong winds from the powerful storm tore down power lines and initially knocked out power to more than 140,000 homes and businesses in California on Tuesday, with many of the outages happening in the northern counties of  San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us. As of Wednesday evening, almost 60,000 California outages remained.
Power outages also were afflicting parts of the Midwest Wednesday evening as snow and freezing rain hit the region. Almost 500,000 customers were without power in four states there, including more than 340,000 in Michigan and more than 115,000 in Illinois, according to the tracking site.
California still is bracing for several feet of snow expected in the mountains with a few inches possible in lower elevations, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.
An in an extremely rare event for that part of the country, blizzard warnings have been issued for the mountains of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura counties, taking effect early Friday morning and lasting through Saturday afternoon. This is the first blizzard warning that the weather service’s Los Angeles office has issued since February 1989, the office said.
“Nearly (the) entire population of California will be able to see snow from some vantage point later this week if they look in the right direction,” according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
The unseasonable weather for the state comes nearly two months after rounds of deadly flooding battered many areas.
“Now is the time to prepare for a COLD AND DANGEROUS winter storm expected for much of the week,” the weather service in Los Angeles said. “Gusty and potentially damaging winds are also expected.”
More than 1,600 flights scheduled for Wednesday within, into or out of the US have been canceled, largely in Minneapolis, Denver, Detroit and Chicago, according to the tracking site FlightAware.
Minneapolis facing up to 2 feet of snow
For Minneapolis, the “historic” three-day storm “will bring widespread accumulating snow, with blowing and drifting snow mainly Wednesday through Thursday,” the National Weather Service in the Twin Cities said.
The worst impacts over the Twin Cities region – which generally includes the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their surrounding suburbs – are expected to begin late Wednesday into Thursday. Heavy snow is expected to blanket the grounds fairly quickly, and be accompanied by gusty winds.
The weather service said to expect sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph that will lead to blizzard conditions Wednesday afternoon. A second round of snow overnight could produce another 9 to 12 inches, with some areas getting up to 15 inches, the service said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz directed the state’s National Guard, the transportation department and the state patrol to be prepared to respond storm impacts, he said on Twitter.
“We’re working to ensure we’re ready – and Minnesotans have a part to play, too. Plan ahead, drive safe, and limit travel,” Walz wrote.
Storm’s path Wednesday
Parts of the Upper Midwest could see snow fall at a rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour, combined with wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, the National Weather Service said. That unrelenting double whammy is set to create whiteout conditions due to falling and blowing snow.
Those expected conditions have put more than 2 million people are under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas.
• Minneapolis: The city could pick up between 15 and 25 inches snow by Thursday. That would be in addition to the 1 to 3 inches that have already fallen there.
• Sioux Falls, South Dakota: In addition to the up to 4 inches of snow the state has already seen, snowfall up to 16 inches and winds of 45 mph are also expected.
• Cheyenne, Wyoming: Heavy snowfall up to 1 foot expected in addition to high winds that could feel as cold as 35 below zero.
• Potentially dangerous icing: Milwaukee in Wisconsin and Detroit and Ann Arbor in Michigan are likely to experience icing beginning Wednesday.
• Severe thunderstorms: Damaging winds and rain are expected Wednesday morning through the afternoon in parts of Oklahoma into western Arkansas, across Missouri and western Illinois, according to the National Weather Service.

Wednesday’s expected conditions have spurred states to take safety measures.
South Dakota’s governor announced Tuesday the closures of state government executive branch offices Wednesday in more than half of the state’s 66 counties, with plans for employees to work remotely. Additionally, interstates 29 and 90 partially closed Tuesday night to prepare for the expected snow.
South Dakota officials announced Wednesday they will be closing sections of those two interstates.
In Minnesota, various state highways and portions of I-90 were closed Wednesday due to blizzard conditions. Still, more than 100 crashes had been reported across the state between 7:30 to 11:30 a.m., according to the Minnesota State Patrol. An additional 34 crashes were reported in the following four hours.
Meanwhile, in Wyoming, several institutions decided to shutter their doors Wednesday, and portions of I-25 and I-80 were closed.
Eastern Wyoming College announced the closure of its main campus. The Natrona County school district in Casper will conduct a virtual learning day Wednesday due to hazardous weather and road conditions throughout the area, the district said.

Why the climate crisis may be coming for your margarita next,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/22/us/margarita-tequila-agave-climate-crisis/index.html,"Why the climate crisis may be coming for your margarita next
Something to consider as you search for happy hours to celebrate National Margarita Day: The delicious concoction’s main ingredient is threatened by changing weather and new strain on the agave plant’s vital pollinator – the bat.
Agave-based liquor like tequila and mezcal was the fastest growing spirits category in 2022, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Analysts even say it might soon surpass vodka as the best-selling liquor in the country.
But scientists from around the world have made it clear that climate change-fueled water shortages will continue to put enormous pressure on food production. Wine and spirits, unfortunately, are not spared from that forecast. A 2019 study found that the climate crisis, coupled with overgrazing from cattle ranching and other human activities, may disrupt the distribution and cultivation of agave, the main ingredient of tequila.
While agave is a drought-tolerant plant that can thrive in hot weather with little to no water, Omanjana Goswami, a food and environment scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the life cycle of agave is too fragile to endure the major weather whiplash the climate crisis is generating – from extreme drought to deadly storm deluges like the one California just experienced.
“Agave is a desert plant, so of course, anything that is moving towards that desert-like weather is going to help this crop thrive,” Goswami told CNN. “But unfortunately, climate effects are not linear. It doesn’t mean that as temperatures warm that will remain consistent.”
“With extreme weather in conjunction with unpredictability, it’s so hard to predict where this is going to go in the future,” she added.
The animals that pollinate agave
Aside from agave plants being sensitive to weather whiplash, there’s also a significant climate threat to pollinators. Bees, butterflies and bats pollinate roughly 30% of the food that ends up on our tables. Bats, like birds, are also considered a major seed disperser. But as temperatures warm, weather gets more extreme and seasons shift, those pollinators are at risk of major disruption.
Warming temperatures have become a growing concern for the Mexican long-nosed bat — a key species for tequila.
“You wouldn’t have tequila if you had no bats, because that’s the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila,” Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, previously told CNN.
There are hundreds of species of agave, but only one — the Weber Azul agave plant — makes tequila. Other agave species were abandoned in Mexico and in the desert regions of the Southwest US. By law, to be considered authentic “tequila,” the spirit must come from the Tequila region in Mexico. Otherwise, agave liquors produced in places like California can only be labeled as an agave spirit.
Because of the high demand for agave spirits, it’s easy for farmers to fall into the practice of monoculture, where they reuse the same soil to grow a single crop, leading to a loss in genetic diversity, scientists told CNN. That includes places like California, where farmers do not rely on external pollinators like bats to grow their agave crops.
But some researchers like Ron Runnebaum, an assistant professor of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis, are looking to explore more of that genetic diversity to see what variants besides the blue agave can adapt and survive in a changing climate to avoid the loss in diversity.
“For us, in the United States, and especially in California, there are just a lot of questions around how we would be able to grow this economically as a crop as a way of diversifying the portfolios of farmers, as they’re facing water shortages, as well as these other extreme events whether extended droughts or an abundance of water in a short period of time,” Runnebaum told CNN.
Economic opportunity
Agave plants require little watering and can allow farmers to plant crops on land that would have otherwise been fallowed due to lack of water. And while it takes six to eight years for agave plants to mature, scientists say agave plants can also suck planet-warming carbon pollution out of the atmosphere.
Given these benefits – and as the West is mired in a multi-year drought – Craig Reynolds, an agave grower and founding director of the California Agave Council, said he sees agave spirits as an economic opportunity in a hotter and drier future.
Eight years ago, Reynolds began growing agave in Northern California as an experiment to see if it would be a viable crop in response to water scarcity.
“We’ve gotten a lot of attention, because the biggest issue (for farmers) is the water,” he told CNN. The “severe cutbacks and groundwater allowances in state and federal water project deliveries, and the fallowing of hundreds of thousands of acres in California and projected long-term fallowing of farmland” is causing the growing interest, he said.
With the help of UC Davis, more resources are going into researching the viability of the low-water crop, especially under a rapidly changing climate. Reynolds said industries need to start adapting and thinking about ways to survive in a hotter and drier future.
“There’s going to be some failures and setbacks here and there,” Reynolds said. “I’m not hoping for the climate to change. I’m just realistic in that we need to do everything we can to slow climate change, but we also have to simultaneously have adaptation strategies to the climate change that is happening – and agave is just part of the adaptation strategy.”"
Antarctic sea ice hit record lows again. Scientists wonder if it’s ‘the beginning of the end’,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/world/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-climate-intl/index.html,"Antarctic sea ice hit record lows again. Scientists wonder if it’s ‘the beginning of the end’
Antarctic sea ice has reached record low levels for the second time in two years, with some scientists alarmed that dramatic drops are a signal the climate crisis may now be more clearly influencing this vast, complex and isolated region.
The sea ice that fringes Antarctica dropped to just 737,000 square miles (1.91 million square kilometers) on February 13, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC, below the previous record of 741,000 square miles (1.92 million square kilometers) set on February 25 last year.
Sea ice could still shrink further; the lowest level of the southern summer may not be reached for more than a week.
The last two years mark the only time that sea ice levels have dipped below 2 million square kilometers since satellites began monitoring it in 1978.
It’s “not just ‘barely a record low,’” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CNN. “It’s on a very steep downward trend.”
Unlike the Arctic, where the rate of sea ice loss has followed a fairly consistent downward trajectory as climate change accelerates, Antarctic sea ice extent has swung up and down, making it harder to figure out how the continent and its surrounding ocean are responding to global heating.
The two polar regions are very different. While the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by continents, Antarctica is a continent surrounded by the ocean – this means its sea ice can grow outward, unconstrained by land. Antarctic ice tends to be thinner than Arctic ice, with greater highs in the winter and steeper declines in the summer.
Climate models projected declines in Antarctic sea ice that were similar to the Arctic, but until recently the region was behaving completely differently than those models predicted.
It hit a record high for winter sea ice extent in 2014 when it reached 7.76 million square miles, which seemed to support the idea that the Antarctic may be relatively insulated from global warming.
But in 2016, something changed. Scientists began observing a steep downward trend.
At first, some put it down to the usual variability of this vastly complex continent, with its diverse, intertwined climate systems. But after two low sea ice records in a row, scientists are becoming concerned.
“The question is, has climate change reached Antarctica? Is this the beginning of the end? Will the sea ice disappear for good in the coming years in the summer?” Christian Haas, head of the Sea Ice Physics Research Section at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, told CNN.
Several factors may feed into why sea ice is so low, including winds, ocean currents and ocean heat.
Air temperatures have been higher than usual in parts of the Antarctic, around 1.5 degrees Celsius above the long term average.
Another important consideration is the belt of westerly winds which circle Antarctica, known as the Southern Annular Mode. These winds, which can increase sea ice melt, have been stronger than usual, according to the NSIDC, and added to weather conditions that pump warm air to the region.
The strength of the winds has been linked, in part, to the increase of planet-heating pollution as well as the hole in the ozone layer above the continent.
There are also suggestions that sea ice may be melting because of warmth trapped just below the surface of the ocean, Scambos said.
“Basically, you’re getting heat stirred into the upper layer [of water] around the Antarctic,” he said. If that theory holds up, and is linked to the general warming of the oceans, “then that has big implications for the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet.”
The disappearance of sea ice can have cascading effects in Antarctica and beyond.
While it doesn’t directly affect sea levels, because it is already floating in the ocean, the loss of the fringe of sea ice around the Antarctic leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them much more vulnerable to melting and breaking up.
An altered Antarctic landscape could have significant impacts on its wildlife, from the microorganisms and algae that prop up the food chain – food for krill which, in turn, feed many of the region’s whales – to the penguins and seals that rely on sea ice for feeding and resting.
Parts of Antarctica have been seeing alarming changes for a while.
The Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of icy mountains which sticks off the west side of the continent like a thumb pointing toward South America, is one of the fastest warming places in the Southern Hemisphere.
Carlos Moffat, an oceanographer at the University of Delaware, who has just returned from a research trip to the Antarctic Peninsula, told CNN that the low sea ice and very warm ocean temperatures they found “are dramatically different from what we have observed in the last few decades.”
Moffat, who visits the region every summer as part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research, said: “This year’s conditions are against a backdrop of long-term change in this region of Antarctica.”
Last year, scientists said West Antarctica’s vast Thwaites Glacier  – also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” – was “hanging on by its fingernails” as the planet warms, with rapid retreat possible over the next few years. Scientists have estimated global sea level rise could increase by around 10 feet if Thwaites collapsed completely, devastating coastal communities around the world.
It’s too early to say whether the record sea ice decline is the new normal or whether it will bounce back, and Antarctica is known for its significant swings. The NSIDC points out that: “While 2022 and 2023 have had record low minimum extent, four out of the five highest minimums have occurred since 2008.”
“It’s going to take a while to unpack,” Scambos said. “We’re still reacting to a relatively sudden change. Certainly the last few years have been a dramatic exclamation point on a trend that was just developing after 2016.”
Scientists will need at least another five years of data and observations, he estimated, but added: “It does feel like something has changed in the Antarctic and that things are fairly dramatic.”

"China provinces and Florida among the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world, analysis finds",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/20/world/regions-climate-risk-extreme-weather-china-florida-xdi-intl/index.html,"China provinces and Florida among the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world, analysis finds
China is home to 16 of the 20 regions of the world most vulnerable to climate change, according to data published on Monday, with some of the world’s most important manufacturing hubs at risk from rising water levels and extreme weather.
The state of Florida ranked as the most vulnerable region outside of China.
Climate risk specialists XDI assessed more than 2,600 regions worldwide, using climate models together with weather and environmental data to assess the economic damage that temperature rises could cause by 2050.
The study is based on a 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperatures by the end of the century, under a scenario drawn up by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The data showed that some of the engine rooms of the global economy face catastrophic hazards such as rising sea levels, river flooding and wildfires, which could also lower property prices and deter investment, XDI said.
The Chinese coastal province of Jiangsu, which is heavily industrialized and accounts for a tenth of China’s GDP, was ranked the world’s most vulnerable territory, followed by neighboring Shandong and the major steel production base of Hebei. The flood-prone central province of Henan was fourth.
The shift of global manufacturing to Asia has driven a substantial increase in infrastructure investment in already vulnerable regions throughout China, making it more susceptible to the impacts of climate change, Hamden said.
“Infrastructure investment has tended to be concentrated in areas that have traditionally been very high-risk - river deltas, coastal zones, and relatively flat areas,” he said.
The highest ranking non-Chinese region was Florida in 10th place, with California 19th, Texas 20th and New York 46th. Nine territories from India were also in the top 50.
While climate is likely to become increasingly decisive when it comes to determining the flow of capital, it remains to be seen whether it will deter investment in more vulnerable regions, said Karl Mallon, XDI’s co-founder.
“There is a lot to be done to work out which areas in the world are potentially adaptable and defendable, and which are probably the areas we will see abandoned in due course,” he said."
"Nearly 30 dangerous feedback loops could permanently shift the Earth’s climate, scientists say",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/world/climate-feedback-loops-tipping-points-arctic-ice-intl/index.html,"Nearly 30 dangerous feedback loops could permanently shift the Earth’s climate, scientists say
Dangerous climate feedback loops are increasing global warming and risk causing a permanent shift away from the Earth’s current climate, according to a new study.
Climate feedback loops are cyclical chain reactions that happen when one change triggers further changes, in a process that keeps on repeating itself. Some of these feedback loops drive down warming, but others amplify it.
Take Arctic ice, for example. Warming temperatures cause sea ice to melt, revealing the dark ocean water beneath. As dark surfaces absorb more heat than reflective surfaces like ice, the ocean warms and more ice melts.
A group of international scientists from institutions including Oregon State University, Exeter University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, pored over climate literature to identify 41 climate feedback loops.
Of these, they found that 27 are driving up global temperatures, according to the study published Friday in the scientific journal One Earth, while just seven are helping to slow the pace of climate crisis.
William Ripple, Professor of Ecology at Oregon State University and a lead author on the study, told CNN that forest die-off, smoldering peatlands and thawing permafrost were particularly worrisome.
“These feedbacks may be large and are difficult to accurately quantify,” Ripple told CNN.
The researchers were surprised by the large number of amplifying climate feedback loops they found, he added.
“To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive list available of climate feedback loops, and not all of them are fully considered in climate models,” Christopher Wolf, a postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University and the study’s other lead author, said in a statement.
Climate feedback loops can also indirectly affect each other, according to the study, creating a complex web of interconnected changes that can accelerate the impacts of the climate crisis.
For example, planet-warming pollution released by thawing permafrost – the frozen layer of soil that blankets the Arctic and other parts of the planet’s far north – increases global temperatures, which in turn helps create the hotter, drier conditions that make wildfires spread faster and burn more intensely. Wildfires release planet-heating pollution, further raising temperatures, and so on.
These interconnections “make it challenging to predict the precise impacts of climate change,” Ripple said.
There is a risk that some of these feedback loops could trigger climate tipping points. For example, feedback loops accelerating Arctic ice melt could ultimately cause the Greenland ice sheet to collapse.
“In the worst case, if amplifying feedbacks are strong enough, the result is likely tragic climate change that’s moved beyond anything humans can control,” Ripple said in a statement.
The study also found seven “dampening” feedback loops, which help stabilize the climate system. These included the ability of land and oceans to absorb planet-heating carbon emissions.
It’s important to “try to get a handle on the strength of all these feedbacks,” Tim Lenton, Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and one of the co-authors, told CNN, to better understand how they work within the complex climate system.
“We, already at 1.5 [degrees Celsius], are likely to cross multiple tipping points, causing feedback loops that would make our options for a safe climate future even fewer,” Johan Rockström, Director of the Potsdam institute and a co-author of the study, told CNN.
The authors called for “immediate and massive” reductions in planet-warming pollution, as well as increased research into climate feedback loops.
“It’s too late to fully prevent the pain of climate change, but if we take meaningful steps soon while prioritizing human basic needs and social justice, it could still be possible to limit the harm,” Ripple said."
"So-called Doomsday Glacier is ‘in trouble,’ scientists say after finding surprising formations under ice shelf",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/15/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate-intl/index.html,"So-called Doomsday Glacier is ‘in trouble,’ scientists say after finding surprising formations under ice shelf
Antarctica’s “Doomsday Glacier” – nicknamed because its collapse could drive catastrophic sea level rise – is melting rapidly in unexpected ways, according to new research.
The Thwaites Glacier is roughly the size of Florida and is located in West Antarctica. Part of what holds it in place is an ice shelf that juts out onto the surface of the ocean. The shelf acts like a cork, holding the glacier back on the land and providing an important defense against sea level rise.
But the crucial ice shelf is highly vulnerable as the ocean warms.
In two studies, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, scientists revealed while the pace of melting underneath much of the ice shelf is slower than previously thought, deep cracks and “staircase” formations in the ice are melting much faster.
As climate change accelerates, the Thwaites Glacier is rapidly changing.
Every year it sheds billions of tons of ice into the ocean, contributing about 4% of annual sea level rise. Particularly rapid melting happens at the point where the glacier meets the seafloor, which has retreated nearly nine miles (14 kilometers) since the late 1990s, exposing a larger slice of ice to relatively warm ocean water.
The complete collapse of the Thwaites itself could lead to sea level rise of more than two feet (70 centimeters), which would be enough to devastate coastal communities around the world. But the Thwaites is also acting like a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, and scientists have estimated global sea level could ultimately rise around 10 feet if the Thwaites collapsed.
While it could take hundreds or thousands of years, the ice shelf could disintegrate much sooner, triggering a retreat of the glacier which is both unstable and potentially irreversible.
To better understand the reshaping of the remote coastline, a team of US and British scientists from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration traveled to the glacier in late 2019.
Using a hot water drill, they bored a hole nearly 2,000 feet (600 meters) deep into the ice and, over a five-day period, sent down various instruments to take measurements from the glacier.
The instruments included a torpedo-like robot called Icefin, which allowed them access to areas previously almost impossible to survey. The remotely-operated vehicle took images and recorded information about the temperature and salinity of the water, as well as ocean currents.
It was able to “swim up to these really dynamic places and take data from the sea floor all the way to the ice,” Britney Schmidt, an associate professor at Cornell University and a lead author on one of the papers, told CNN.
The results of the research reveal “a very nuanced and complex picture,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey and a lead author on the other paper, told CNN.
The scientists found even though the glacier is receding, the rate of melting beneath much of the flat part of the ice shelf was lower than expected. The melt rate averaged 2 to 5.4 meters a year, according to the study, less than previous models had projected.
Melting is being suppressed by a layer of colder, fresher water at the base of the glacier, between the ice shelf and the ocean, according to the research.
“The glacier is still in trouble,” Davis said in a statement, adding, “What we have found is that despite small amounts of melting there is still rapid glacier retreat, so it seems that it doesn’t take a lot to push the glacier out of balance.”
The scientists were also surprised by a second finding. They discovered an underwater glacial landscape much more complex than expected, dominated by strange staircaselike terraces and crevasses – big cracks going all the way through the ice shelf.
Melting was particularly rapid in these areas, the research team found. Warm, salty water was able to funnel through and widen cracks and crevasses, contributing to instabilities in the glacier.
“The glacier is not just melting up, but it’s melting out,” Schmidt said.
Melting along the sloped ice of the cracks and terraces “may become the primary trigger for ice shelf collapse,” according to the studies’ authors.
The findings add a new layer to a slew of alarming studies pointing to the glacier’s rapid melting.
A 2021 study found the ice shelf could shatter within the next five years, and last year scientists said the Thwaites Glacier is hanging on “by its fingernails” as the planet warms, with the potential for rapid retreat in the coming years.
“We knew these glaciers were changing. We knew it was related to ocean temperature. We knew there was melting going on. We knew that the atmosphere was warming. And we knew that the glaciers were falling apart,” Schmidt said.
What the latest research does is provide “the missing pieces” to work out exactly how this change is happening, she said.
David Rounce, a glaciologist at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in the study, told CNN the new research offered “novel insights into how rapidly the bottom of the ice shelf is melting and the mechanisms by which it’s melting, which are very important for improving our understanding and ability to model how Thwaites will change in the future.”
Davis said the research can help make more accurate projections about sea level rise, which can be fed into efforts to mitigate climate change and protect coastal communities. From a more personal perspective, he said, he also hopes it prompts people “to sit up and take notice of the changes that are occurring.”
“Despite it being so remote, the consequences of what happens on Thwaites will impact everybody,” Davis said."

This controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/world/solar-dimming-geoengineering-climate-solution-intl/index.html,"This controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster
When US startup Make Sunsets released two weather balloons into the skies above Mexico’s Baja California peninsula last year, it kicked up a fierce debate about one of the world’s most controversial climate solutions.
The plan was for the balloons, filled with helium and a small amount of sulfur dioxide, to float high into the stratosphere. There they would burst, dispersing their load of sun-reflecting sulfur dioxide particles and cool the Earth, just a tiny bit.
Some dismissed it as a stunt. It is not clear if any particles were actually released or even if the balloons made it to the stratosphere. But Make Sunsets’ experiment is significant for crossing a threshold when it comes to a hotly-debated climate solution: solar geoengineering.
To its supporters, solar geoengineering is a fix we cannot ignore as the world hurtles toward climate disaster. For critics, it is a technology so dangerous we shouldn’t even research it.
What is solar geoengineering?
At its simplest, solar geoengineering, also known as solar radiation management, is an attempt to bring down the planet’s temperature by reflecting sunlight away or allowing more heat to escape into space.
There are three main techniques:
Marine cloud brightening involves trying to make the low clouds over the ocean more reflective by spraying them with sea salt.
Cirrus cloud thinning targets wispy clouds higher up in the atmosphere, seeding them with aerosol particles in an attempt to thin them, so they trap less heat.
The most-researched method, however, is stratospheric aerosol injection. It involves spraying aerosols – such as sulfur dioxide particles – into the stratosphere, more than 12 miles above the Earth’s surface, to reflect sunlight back into space. It could be done with balloons or specialized airplanes able to fly at high altitude.
The idea takes its cue from volcanoes. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, the sulfur dioxide it expelled high into the atmosphere had the effect of temporarily cooling the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit).
Why is solar geoengineering such a hot topic?
The idea has been around since the 1960s, but it’s getting more attention because progress to tackle climate change is so far off-pace.
The world is on track to pass critical warming thresholds, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages increase dramatically.
Scientists have even gone as far as to propose blowing moon dust toward the Earth to act as a sun shield, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the planet.
“I wish there was no geoengineering!” Luke Iseman, the founder of Make Sunsets told CNN in an email. But “there are no other realistic options to stay below 2 [degrees Celsius],” he said.
While pretty much no one is claiming solar geoengineering could replace planet-warming pollution cuts and solve climate change, supporters argue it could have a big planetary cooling effect for a relatively small price tag. A 2018 Harvard study estimated it would cost around $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period.
The world needs to cut emissions, “no question,” David Keith, professor of applied physics and public policy, at Harvard University told CNN. But it doesn’t mean we can afford to ignore other climate solutions, he added.
“I’m not saying we have to do solar geoengineering, but I think it’s worth considering all the tools,” he said.
Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told CNN there are good reasons to be skeptical of solar geoengineering. But, he said, if it “could provide a path for decreasing the impacts of climate change on millions of the world’s most vulnerable people (and on ecosystems), we have a responsibility to explore the opportunities, as well as the risks.”
For some of the most at-risk countries, including low-lying island nations, climate change already threatens their existence. A 2019 survey of more than 700 climate experts found those who expected severe climate damage in their own countries were more supportive of solar geoengineering.
Why is it so controversial?
In the eyes of its opponents, the technology could open the door to an almost infinite number of potential negative consequences.
“Just because we’re desperate doesn’t suddenly make solar geoengineering a good idea, because the risks are so immense,” Lili Fuhr, from the Center for International Environmental Law, told CNN.
There are fears fiddling with the planet’s thermostat could alter rainfall patterns and shift monsoons, with potentially devastating consequences for crops.
Effects could vary across regions, with some areas reaping benefits while others are harmed, increasing the chance of conflict.
“When things go wrong, it is usually the poor people that suffer the most,” said Chukwumerije Okereke, professor of global climate and environmental governance at Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria.
People are already suggesting African countries as a testing ground for the technologies, Okereke said. “It is a distraction from the sort of policies and help that should be coming to Africa.”
Solar geoengineering could also damage the ozone layer, which shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays, and is currently on track to repair itself after the success of a ban on ozone-depleting chemicals.
Then there are the difficulties of implementation.
As the aerosol particles do not tend to remain in the atmosphere for more than about a year, solar geoengineering would have to be continuously maintained. If halted, there is a risk of “termination shock,” unleashing all the pent-up warming “waiting in the wings, ready to slap the Earth in the face,” Raymond Pierrehumbert, professor of physics at Oxford University, told CNN.
It would also require unprecedented international cooperation, Frank Biermann, professor of global sustainability governance at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told CNN. “It would mean that countries have to collaborate forever,” he said, including those currently at war.
One of the biggest criticisms of solar geoengineering is it could be grasped by polluters as a way to continue polluting, and by governments as a distraction from policies to reduce planet-heating pollution.
In 2021, a group of nearly 400 scientists called for an “international non-use agreement,” a commitment to restrict the development of solar geoengineering “before it is too late.”
Governments should consider solar geoengineering in the same way they do chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear testing and Arctic mining, Biermann said.
What’s the progress so far?
There has been a flurry of interest in the technology, especially in the US.
In 2019, Congress allocated $4 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for stratospheric research, some of which was for solar geoengineering. And last year, the Biden administration announced a five-year research plan to explore the concept.
A 2021 report from the National Academy of Sciences called for the US to allocate up to $200 million to a research program to better understand solar geoengineering, including its feasibility, impacts on society and the environment, and public perceptions.
Research organizations are also providing funding. In February, the UK-based Degrees Initiative announced $900,000 for research in countries across Africa, Asia and South America to look at how the technology could affect the Global South.
So far, outdoor experiments have been difficult to get off the ground and have faced heavy resistance.
An attempt by Harvard University researchers to test a high-altitude balloon in Arctic Sweden in 2021 was abandoned after an outcry from local Indigenous Sami people. A letter on behalf of the Sami Council said solar geoengineering “entails risks of catastrophic consequences.”
And following Make Sunset’s balloon release, the Mexican government announced in January it would ban solar geoengineering experiments.
As the world heats up and solar geoengineering shifts from sci-fi to mainstream, tussles between those who say there is an obligation to research it as a potential last-chance solution and those convinced it is the path to catastrophe are only likely to increase.
Critics like Biermann, however, remain unwavering in their opposition.
“It’s very risky. It cannot be governed. It’s unethical,” he said. “And it is one of the biggest dangers in the current climate policies.”"
‘Exceptional’ warming: January temperatures 2.2 degrees higher than average in Europe,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/europe/europe-extreme-heat-january-climate-intl/index.html,"‘Exceptional’ warming: January temperatures 2.2 degrees higher than average in Europe
Europe has experienced an exceptionally warm January, with average temperatures 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1990 to 2020 average, according to data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
The month started with a record-breaking heatwave, as New Year’s Day saw an alarming number of heat records fall across the continent, with at least eight countries experiencing their warmest-ever January day.
The climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe, told CNN at the time that it was “the most extreme heat wave in European history.”
The Balkans, eastern Europe, Finland, northwest Russia and Svalbard, the Arctic archipelago off the coast of Norway, all experienced particularly high temperatures in January, according to Copernicus, which analyzes billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.
“While January 2023 is exceptional, these extreme temperatures remain a tangible indication of the effects of a changing climate for many regions and can be understood as an additional warning of future extreme events,” Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.
Europe is warming faster than any other region, according to the World Meteorological Organization, as planet-heating pollution pushes temperatures towards critical warming thresholds.
The continent is seeing increased wildfires, blistering heatwaves and destructive droughts.
Globally, January temperatures were 0.25 degrees warmer than the 1991-2020 January average, according to the Copernicus data, with places including the eastern United States, Canada and Mexico experiencing above average temperatures.
The data also found record levels of sea ice melt in Antarctica in January.
Sea ice extent – the amount of ocean covered in ice – was 31% below average, the lowest levels the satellite dataset has ever recorded and significantly below the previous record set in 2017.
Unlike the Arctic where sea ice has been melting for decades, Antarctica’s sea ice is very variable. After years of sea ice increases, Antarctic sea ice started declining from 2016 and the region is now reporting record lows.
Arctic sea ice extent was 4% below average, with the Barents Sea and Svalbard most affected, Copernicus data showed.
It wasn’t hot everywhere. Below average temperatures were recorded in countries including Siberia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia. Some scientists have pointed to Arctic warming as one reason behind the extreme cold snaps the world continues to experience, even as winters become warmer overall.

"Climate change is contributing to the rise of superbugs, new UN report says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/health/superbugs-climate-change-scn/index.html,"Climate change is contributing to the rise of superbugs, new UN report says
Climate change and antimicrobial resistance are two of the greatest threats to global health, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme.
The report, titled “Bracing for Superbugs,” highlights the role of climate change and other environmental factors contributing to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. It was announced Tuesday at the Sixth Meeting of the Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance in Barbados.
Antimicrobial resistance or AMR happens when germs such as bacteria, viruses and fungi develop the ability to defeat the medications designed to kill them.
“The development and spread of AMR means that antimicrobials used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants might turn ineffective, with modern medicine no longer able to treat even mild infections,” the UN Environment Programme said in a news release.
Roughly 5 million deaths worldwide were associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, and the annual toll is expected to increase to 10 million by 2050 if steps aren’t taken to stop the spread of antimicrobial resistance, according to the report.
In the US, there are nearly 3 million antimicrobial-resistant infections each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
Antimicrobials are commonly used in cleaning products, plant pesticides and medications to kill and prevent the spread of germs among people, animals and crops.
Drug resistance can develop naturally, but experts say the overuse of antimicrobials in people, animals and food production has accelerated the process. The microorganisms that survive these chemicals are stronger and more powerful, and they can spread their drug-resistant genes to germs that have never been exposed to antimicrobials.
The focus so far has largely been on excessive antimicrobial use, but experts say there is growing evidence that environmental factors play a significant role in the development, transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
“Climate change, pollution, changes in our weather patterns, more rainfall, more closely packed, dense cities and urban areas – all of this facilitates the spread of antibiotic resistance. And I am certain that this is only going to go up with time unless we take relatively drastic measures to curb this,” said Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious diseases specialist at Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved with the new UN report.
Climate change and antimicrobial resistance
The climate crisis worsens antimicrobial resistance in several ways. Research has shown that increased temperatures increase both the rate of bacterial growth and the rate of the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes between microorganisms.
“As we get a more extreme climate, especially as it warms, the gradients that drive the evolution of resistance will actually accelerate. So, by curbing temperature rises and reducing the extremity of events, we can actually then fundamentally curb the probability of evolving new resistance,” Dr. David Graham, a professor of ecosystems engineering at Newcastle University and one of the UN report’s authors, said at a news conference ahead of the report’s release.
Experts also say severe flooding as a result of climate change can lead to conditions of overcrowding, poor sanitation and increased pollution, which are known to increase infection rates and antimicrobial resistance as human waste, heavy metals and other pollutants in water create favorable conditions for bugs to develop resistance.
“The same drivers that cause environmental degradation are worsening the antimicrobial resistance problem. The impacts of antimicrobial resistance could destroy our health and food systems,” Inger Andersen, the UN Environment Programme’s executive director, said at the news conference.
Making diseases harder to treat
Environmental pressures are creating bugs that thrive in the human body, which experts say is unusual for some species.
“There’s one hypothesis from a prominent mycologist who suggests that the reason the body’s temperature is 98.6 is because that is the temperature where fungi can’t grow that well. And so, now we’re seeing Candida auris and some of the other new microbes that have come up that really grow quite well – even at temperatures of 98.6 in the human body. And so I think climate change, really selecting for these organisms to adapt to a warmer climate, is going to increase the odds that there’s infection in humans,” Roberts said.
Such opportunistic infections jeopardize medical advancements like joint replacements, organ transplants and chemotherapy – procedures in which patients have a significant risk of infection and require effective antibiotics.
Drug-resistant infections can make treatment difficult or even impossible. Roberts says that resorting to “last-ditch treatments” is “never a good scenario from the patient level because there are reasons we don’t use them up front,” such as organ toxicity and failure.
“When somebody does present with a drug-resistant bacteria or fungus and we really need to rely on one of these last-line antibiotics, it’s usually a challenge to treat from the outset. And so the patients really don’t do as well as a result,” he said. “In rare circumstances, we run out of options entirely, and in that case, there’s really nothing we can do. Fortunately, those cases remain quite rare, but I am certain that with this growing antibiotic resistance problem, we’ll see these increasing frequency over time.”
Actions to fight antimicrobial resistance
Experts say that both climate change and antimicrobial resistance have been worsened by and can be improved by human actions. One critical step is to limit antibiotic overuse and misuse.
“Antibiotics and antifungals do not work on viruses, such as colds and the flu. These drugs save lives. But, anytime they are used, they can lead to side effects and antimicrobial resistance,” the UN report’s authors wrote.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
The authors also emphasize that the health of people, animals, plants and the environment are closely linked and interdependent, and they call on governments to identify policies to limit antibiotic use in agriculture and reduce environmental pollution.
Finally, experts say, steps to reduce climate change are steps to limit antimicrobial resistance.
“Whatever we can do on an individual level to kind of reduce the impact of climate change, really, that’s kind of only worsening this problem, as well as pollution and urbanization and in dense, crowded areas. Although I know from the individual level that’s a hard thing to change,” Roberts said."
"Atmospheric rivers aren’t just a problem for California. They’re changing the Arctic, too",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/world/atmospheric-river-arctic-sea-ice-climate/index.html,"Atmospheric rivers aren’t just a problem for California. They’re changing the Arctic, too
The Arctic is seeing a rapid decline in sea ice even during the cold winter months when it should be recovering from the summer melt. Scientists say that one often-overlooked factor is playing a bigger role than previously thought: Atmospheric rivers.
These long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere transport warm air and water vapor from the tropics. They can extend for thousands of miles and dump rain and snow when they make landfall.
In January, atmospheric rivers brought a parade of deadly storms that unleashed heavy rain, flooding and mudslides in California.
Now they are increasingly reaching the Arctic, according to a study by a team led by Penn State University scientists and published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Using satellite observations and climate models, the scientists found that atmospheric rivers are reaching the Arctic more frequently during the winter season, especially over the Barents-Kara Seas, off the north coasts of Norway and Russia.
The authors used satellite images to analyze sea ice immediately following the atmospheric river storms and discovered sea ice retreated for up to 10 days.
In winter, temperatures in the Arctic are below freezing and the ice should be recovering. Instead these powerful storms are slowing down seasonal ice recovery. The storms can be blamed for a third of the Arctic’s wintertime sea ice loss, the scientists reported.
“Arctic sea ice decline is among the most obvious evidence of global warming from the past several decades,” Pengfei Zhang, the study’s lead author and assistant research professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, said in a statement. “Despite temperatures in the Arctic being well below freezing, sea ice decline in winter is still very significant. And our research shows atmospheric rivers are one factor in understanding why.”
Atmospheric rivers are inherently warmer than the surrounding Arctic environment and can act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth’s surface and preventing it from escaping out to space. Their heavy rainfall also has a melting effect, especially on fragile, re-growing ice.
Climate change is amplifying the intensity of atmospheric rivers, scientists say, as a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall when they make landfall.
Using climate modeling, the study also found evidence that global warming is one factor in the increased rate of atmospheric river storms in the Arctic.
The Arctic, which is warming up to four times faster than the rest of the planet, has undergone dramatic changes in recent decades. Last year, in its annual Arctic health checkup, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found it has become hotter, rainier and wetter, with a rapid decline in snow cover and unprecedented late season melting.
This latest report on atmospheric rivers adds another layer of complexity to those findings.
Marty Ralph, the director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, who was not involved in the research, said the study underscores the larger impact of atmospheric rivers.
“It is clear that the future of Arctic sea ice hinges to a significant degree on the strength and frequency of occurrence of [atmospheric rivers],” Ralph told CNN.
The loss of Arctic sea ice has significant consequences for the rest of the planet. The absence of reflective ice opens up the dark waters beneath, causing the ocean to absorb more heat, feeding into a cycle of melting and heating. The melting of freshwater into the ocean can also disrupt ocean circulation patterns, exacerbating global warming.
“Sea ice melting has a big impact for the climate system and for society, and our study finds the Arctic is an open system and that climate change is way more complicated than temperature change alone can explain,” Laifang Li, co-author of the study and assistant professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State, said in a statement."
Extreme cold snaps: Why temperatures still plummet to dangerous levels even as the planet warms,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/03/world/extreme-cold-arctic-polar-vortex-climate-intl/index.html,"Extreme cold snaps: Why temperatures still plummet to dangerous levels even as the planet warms
Even as the world smashes through one all-time heat record after another and speeds towards critical warming thresholds, brutal waves of deadly cold can still arrive in bomb cyclones that bring icy weather and deep snow – and add fuel for those who deny the climate crisis is real or significant.
But some scientists say that climate change – and more specifically rapid warming in the Arctic – may actually be increasing the likelihood that frigid, polar air can dive south.
Look no further than the heavily populated US Northeast this weekend to see a real-time example of the long-term warming trend being interrupted by tremendous, record-setting cold.
Last month will be remembered for the winter-that-wasn’t in the region – ranking as the warmest January on record for nearly all Northeast cities. It was the first month in New York City that temperatures ranked above-average every single day, and first time the month ended without measurable snowfall in the city.
But the weather pendulum swings hard to the other extreme this weekend when record warmth will become record cold, with dozens of low temperature milestones predicted. The wind chill is expected to plunge to dangerous levels of minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 Celsius) for millions on Saturday.
So what’s going on?
Extreme cold
While winters are becoming warmer overall and warm records outpace cold, this January brought a brutal cold snap deep into parts of Asia.
Temperatures in the city of Mohe in northern China plummeted to minus 53 degrees Celsius (minus 63.4 degrees Fahrenheit), the lowest temperature the country has ever recorded.
Fierce cold and record amounts of heavy snow in Japan killed at least four people in what the country’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno called a “once-in-a-decade cold snap.”
Low temperature records also fell in several places in South Korea.
“Cold air from the North Pole has reached South Korea directly,” after traveling through Russia and China, Korea Meteorological Administration spokesperson Woo Jin-kyu told CNN.
More than 150 people died in Afghanistan as temperatures reached lows of minus 28 degrees Celsius (minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit), in what has so far been one of the country’s harshest winters.
And the world’s coldest city, Yakutsk in eastern Siberia, saw temperatures reach minus 62.7 degrees Celsius (minus 80.9 degrees Fahrenheit) – the lowest in more than two decades according to meteorologists.
Extreme winter weather is now shifting to the US, with dangerously cold Arctic air pushing southwards, sweeping across many parts of the country and quickly dispensing with what had been a mild January.
What explains the cold?
Our weather is intimately connected with the jet stream, a wavy river of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere, around the level at which airplanes fly.
When the jet stream swings south, cold Arctic air can dive into the mid-latitudes along with it – the part of the Earth where the most people live in North America, Europe and Asia.
That’s what happened in Asia in January, Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, told CNN.
When the jet stream retreats north, warm air will also push further north. A big high-pressure swing over Europe in January led to record warm winter temperatures and and left some mountains bare of snow.
There is also another factor to consider: The polar vortex.
This is a belt of strong winds encircling blisteringly cold Arctic air, which sits extremely high in the stratosphere – above the level of the jet stream – around the North Pole.
The polar vortex is like a spinning top, Cohen said. In its normal state, it rotates very fast, keeping the cold air close to the center, like an ice skater spinning quickly on the spot, arms neatly across their chest.
But every now and then it gets disrupted. It’s as if the ice skater hits a crack in the ice and flies off course, arms flailing. The polar vortex wobbles, becoming stretched and distorted, spilling out cold air and influencing the path of the jet stream.
The devastating cold spell that hit Texas in 2021, taking out power across much of the state and leading to more than 240 deaths, was caused by one of these stretching events, as was the historic cold that hit the US in late December.
Some scientists say minor disruptions in the polar vortex may help explain the recent extreme cold in Asia.
How does climate change fit in?
The theory centers on the Arctic, which is warming up to four times faster than the rest of the world as a result of heat-trapping pollution from burning fossil fuels.
Some scientists argue that this warming is triggering changes to the jet stream and polar vortex, causing more frequent winter extremes.
This idea gained traction following the publication of a 2012 study, co-authored by Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. It suggested that Arctic warming was reducing the difference between the cold temperatures in the north and warm temperatures in the south, leading to a weaker, wavier jet stream, which pushed very cold air southwards.
Francis’ paper kicked off a debate and, in the decade since, many more scientists have looked at the theory.
One of the most prominent papers, co-authored by Cohen in 2021, said it found clear links between Arctic warming and disruptions to the polar vortex.
Cohen’s argument is that particularly rapid heating in an area of the Arctic, north of western Russia, combined with increased snowfall in Siberia, amplifies the waviness of the jet stream and pushes energy upwards. This knocks the polar vortex off course, causing very cold air to spill out.
The paper linked Arctic warming to extreme winter weather across parts of Asia and North America, including the prolonged cold wave in Texas in 2021.
“We are not arguing that winters are getting colder overall,” Cohen said. The world is smashing through many more heat records than it is cold records.
But the idea that climate change will mean fewer swings between extreme temperatures is “an oversimplification,” he said.
“As we continue to dump greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and thicken this blanket of greenhouse gasses around the Earth, we will see more extreme events of all sorts, including these cold spells,” Francis told CNN.
How settled is the science?
Not at all. This is a very complex area of research and other scientists are far more cautious.
There have been a number of cold winters in the US and Asia coinciding with warm winters in the Arctic, James Screen, professor in climate science at Exeter University, told CNN. “The challenge we face is determining cause from effect.”
Screen co-authored research which used climate models to predict what will happen when Arctic sea ice reduces even further. It found sea ice loss had only a very small effect on the jet stream and there was no real sign of an effect on the polar vortex.
While the research pointed to warmer Arctic winters and bursts of cold further south, Screen said this can be “explained by normal weather variability.”
In other words, even as winters warm, cold extremes will still occur – because that’s just how winters work.
One key criticism of the research linking Arctic changes to severe winter weather is that it’s based on historical data.
“If we look more at climate model data, we don’t see these types of links or they’re very weak,” Dim Coumou, a climate professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, told CNN.
What scientists do agree on is the need to keep studying these extremely cold spells.
“We don’t really have enough research yet,” Daniela Domeisen, a climate professor at ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, told CNN. “Eventually we’ll find a solution to this and actually understand the mechanism, but I just think we’re not there yet.”

‘The Ark’ and ‘JUNG_E’ both envision humans fleeing an Earth ruined by climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/entertainment/ark-and-jung-e-climate-change-sci-fi-shows/index.html,"‘The Ark’ and ‘JUNG_E’ both envision humans fleeing an Earth ruined by climate change
Science fiction regularly explores exaggerated visions of real-world problems, including apprehensions about the climate crisis. In the last few weeks, that’s produced a pair projects, Syfy’s “The Ark” and the Netflix movie “JUNG_E,” which begin from the premise that humans have so defiled Earth they need to venture out into space in order to find a new place to live.
The idea certainly isn’t a new one, having provided the foundation for the 2008 Disney/Pixar movie “WALL-E,” in which a lonely robot was left behind while bloated people took refuge in space.
These new productions use the threat of climate calamity to explore different themes and sci-fi motifs – in the case of “The Ark,” which comes from producer Dean Devlin (of “Independence Day” and “Stargate” renown), what amounts to a wagon train of pioneers on a space-faring vessel; and in the South Korean film, a contemplation of artificial intelligence through a mother-daughter relationship and a decades-long civil war involving outposts of survivors.
Both fall somewhat flat, in separate ways.
Set 100 years in the future, “The Ark” focuses on Ark One, the first of several massive ships dispatched into space, each seeking to establish colonies that can offer salvation to those left behind. The occupants of the craft, however, are awakened prematurely from their cryogenic sleep by an unknown accident that has killed most of the “mentor class,” forcing junior officers and more youthful personnel to try to save the mission and the crew of 150 survivors on board.
Alas, that conceit results in a lot of young-adult-oriented flourishes that come across as particularly stilted, as if the “Star Trek” cadet class was put in charge amid pressing concerns about water, food and other rations that weren’t expected to be needed this early in the voyage.
If this sort of series is only as good as its characters, “The Ark” is a poorly populated enterprise, not to be confused with the Enterprise.
As for “JUNG_E,” the film turns out to be visually striking and narratively muddled, with a story that starts somewhere in the middle, throws around lots of provocative science-fiction concepts and comes to a rather abrupt end.
The narrative opens with humanity embroiled in 40 years of civil war, after climate change has forced people to off-planet shelters that have declared war on each other. Seeking to end the conflict, a team of scientists is working to create an army of warriors based on a legendary soldier, Yun Jung-yi (Kim Hyun-joo), using her brain data in android hosts more than 30 years after her death.
Adding an emotional hook, the project is spearheaded by the soldier’s now-grown daughter, Yun Seo-hyun (Kang Soo-youn, who died last year, shortly after completing work on the movie).
Directed by Yeon Sang-ho (“Train to Busan”), “JUNG_E” devotes too much of its time to those research simulations, as the daughter and her team try to perfect the prototype.
The importance of that plan feels hazy – that is, why the model in question is deemed a potential game-changer in the war – further confused by the machinations of the conglomerate behind it amid a conflict that has dragged on for decades.
Perhaps inevitably, both “The Ark” and “JUNG_E” feel like mash-ups of previous sci-fi concepts. That includes the latter’s impressive design and look, which perhaps most closely resemble the Will Smith movie “I, Robot” in terms of the androids, with a pinch of “Blade Runner’s” grimy dystopia.
Early pioneers sought better lives, so there are old-school underpinnings to the notion of venturing out among the stars – “The final frontier,” as Gene Roddenberry eloquently put it – as humanity pursues refuge. That becomes more sobering, of course, when people are forced to do so by their own failed stewardship of the planet.
Yet while the concept is provocative, in science fiction it’s inevitably just a jumping-off point – and with these two projects, a start that leads to fairly forgettable journeys into the unknown.
“The Ark” premieres February 1 at 10 p.m. ET on Syfy and Peacock. “JUNG_E” is available on Netflix."
A dire forecast: Scientists used AI to find planet could cross critical warming threshold sooner than expected,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/30/world/global-warming-critical-threshold-climate-intl/index.html,"A dire forecast: Scientists used AI to find planet could cross critical warming threshold sooner than expected
The planet could cross critical global warming thresholds sooner than previous models have predicted, even with concerted global climate action, according to a new study using machine learning.
The study estimates that the planet could reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in a decade, and found a “substantial possibility” of global temperature rises crossing the 2-degree threshold by mid-century, even with significant global efforts to bring down planet-warming pollution.

Data shows average global temperature has already climbed risen around 1.1 to 1.2 degrees since industrialization.
“Our results provide further evidence for high-impact climate change, over the next three decades,” noted the report, published on Monday in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, countries have pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial levels.
Scientists have identified 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages will increase dramatically.
Temperature rises over 2 degrees could bring catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts, including pushing three billion people into “chronic water scarcity.”
The study used artificial neural networks – a type of machine learning or artificial intelligence – which scientists trained on climate models and then used historical observations of temperature around the world “as independent input from which the AI makes a prediction,” said Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford University and a co-author on the study.
Diffenbaugh and his co-author Elizabeth Barnes, a professor at Colorado State University, assessed three different scenarios: Low, medium and high “forcing” climate pathways, which refer to the intensity of the heating caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
In all three scenarios, the scientists estimated that the world would hit 1.5 degrees of warming between 2033 and 2035, even if planet-warming pollution is substantially reduced.
Diffenbaugh said that while “individual years are likely to reach 1.5 degrees sooner,” their predictions “are focused on how long until the global mean temperature was warmed 1.5 degrees.”
The study’s prediction is in line with previous models. In a major report published in 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the world could cross the 1.5-degree threshold “in the early 2030s.”
Where the study departs from many current projections is in its estimates of when the world will cross the 2-degree threshold.
While the IPCC projects that in a low emissions scenario, global temperature rises are unlikely to hit 2 degrees by the end of the century, the study returned more concerning results.
The AI predicted a probability of around 80% that 2 degrees warming will be reached before 2065, even if, over the next half century, the world reaches net-zero – where it removes at least as much planet-warming pollution from the atmosphere as it emits.
If emissions stay high, Diffenbaugh said, the AI predicted a 50% probability that 2 degrees will be reached before 2050.
There is “clear evidence that a half degree of global warming poses substantial risks for people and ecosystems. Hence, the greater the global warming, the greater the challenges for adaptation,” Diffenbaugh said.
While many net zero decarbonization pledges and targets have been framed around holding global warming to 1.5 degrees, he added: “The AI predictions in our study suggest that those may be necessary to avoid 2 degrees.”
The use of machine learning to make predictions is increasing in climate science, Diffenbaugh said.
“The AI is able to learn the most reliable indicators of how long is left until a given global warming level is reached in a large number of sometimes contradictory climate model predictions.”"

Winter heating costs likely won’t be as high as feared, but many still need help
Heating your home this winter likely won’t burn quite as big a hole in your wallet as initially forecast.
Both the US Energy Information Administration and the National Energy Assistance Directors Association this month lowered their cost estimates for heating with natural gas and oil. That’s thanks to a combination of lower energy prices and a milder-than-expected winter.
That’s the good news.
The bad news is that it will still cost way more to keep warm than it did last winter. That’s driving a surge in the number of people applying for federal heating assistance — but not everyone will be able to get the help they need, as there’s less federal funding to distribute this year.
Lower forecasts
Home heating this winter will cost an average of $1,162 across all fuel types, according to EIA’s January projection of total average costs for the season. That’s down $46 from the agency’s October forecast.
The change, however, varies widely by fuel. Those who heat with natural gas will pay an estimated $828 over the course of the winter, down $103 from the initial forecast.
Heating with oil will cost an estimated $2,342 for the season, down $12 from the October forecast. But that’s actually a bigger decrease than it seems because the EIA hiked its projection by several hundred dollars in November amid a spike in oil prices that has since receded.
Those with electric heat will pay about the same amount, roughly $1,360, while those who heat with propane will pay an estimated $1,727, up $59 from the earlier projection.
Still, costs are up across the board compared to last winter — nearly 26% and 14.5% for heating oil and natural gas, respectively, and 10.5% and nearly 9% for electricity and propane, respectively.
“You’re still paying more, but not as much more,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “If the warming trend continues, then it will be cheaper because you just don’t need to use as much fuel.”
Challenges for small businesses and customers alike
All the price fluctuations have made for a tough winter for home heating oil delivery companies, which are usually small, multi-generational family businesses.
They have had to work with their banks to increase their lines of credit to purchase inventory and with their customers to put them on budget plans so they can better afford deliveries.
More people have had to go on budget plans this year, and they are taking longer to pay their bills, said Sean Cota, CEO of the National Energy & Fuels Institute, a trade association for independent oil heat, propane, biofuel and motor fuel dealers and associated companies.
“For the retail industry, it probably was and continues to be the most challenging year in our history,” Cota said of the “crazy differences” in prices each month. “The only good part has been that it’s been warm because of the tight supply — which is also bad for us, right? Because we need to sell stuff to stay in business.”
For Jason Bell, the milder winter — plus a move to a rental house that heats with natural gas instead of electricity — has meant that he and his husband, Shane, can save more money to buy their own home.
So far, they received a monthly bill of about $130 for electricity and $236 for natural gas. That compares to the roughly $470 monthly budget plan they were on in their old place, which also cost $200 more a month in rent.
The savings, as well as the general decline in inflation in recent months, means that Bell can drop one of his two full-time jobs later this year.
“We were hoping that in conjunction with the warmer temperatures and us turning the thermostat down at night that the heating bill would be a lot less,” said Bell, who is a police officer in a nearby borough and a state dog warden. “It offers a lot more breathing room.”
Despite the estimated dip in costs, many Americans are in need of help. Applications for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program are projected to reach their highest level in more a decade, Wolfe said.
Already, it’s up by as many as 1.3 million applications, the largest one-year increase since 2009. That’s on top of last year’s estimated 4.9 million beneficiaries.
To help its residents cope with the high heating costs, Maine started sending $450 energy relief payments on Monday. An estimated 880,000 people will receive the assistance, which will be sent to individuals with incomes below $100,000 and couples filing joint returns making twice that. Each spouse will get the $450 payment.
In Connecticut, applications have jumped 23% so far this season, which started in September, said Peter Hadler, the state’s LIHEAP director. That’s on top of a 27% increase over the same period a year ago.
He said his staff is hearing from people dealing with multiple financial challenges, including higher prices for energy and food and the elimination of pandemic supplements, such as the enhanced child tax credit and three rounds of stimulus checks.
Triple whammy
The agency itself is contending with a triple whammy: more applications, higher fuel costs and less federal funding. Last January, it paid around $3.15 a gallon for oil for fuel delivery. Now, it’s around $4.10 a gallon, though at least that’s down from the roughly $5.70 a gallon in November.
Hadler expects to receive $118.5 million in federal LIHEAP funds for fiscal year 2023, down from $140.5 million the prior fiscal year, when Congress poured billions more into the federal program through the American Rescue Plan Act.
Last season, the federal appropriation for LIHEAP totaled a record of about $8.4 billion, while this fiscal year, it’s about $6.1 billion.
If the federal funds run out, the state has promised to pitch in $30 million.
Still, Connecticut has had to reduce the amount of assistance it can grant each household.
For instance, last year the lowest-income vulnerable families — who had senior citizens, young children or disabled members — could receive up to $4,825 in fuel deliveries. This season, they can get only a maximum of $2,320.
“We’re hearing from seniors and other applicants concerned about their ability to heat their homes,” Hadler said. “They’re keenly aware of the decline in benefits compared to last year. It’s small comfort for them to know that it is due to less federal funding. The bottom line is the benefits are smaller.”

‘Dangerous’ arctic air returns this weekend after a month-long hiatus,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/28/weather/dangerous-cold-temperatures-weekend-midwest-plains/index.html,"‘Dangerous’ arctic air returns this weekend after a month-long hiatus
What has been a mild start to 2023 will come crashing to a halt this weekend as winter makes a roaring comeback across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Minneapolis residents have seen a mild January so far – at least by their standards – with temperatures failing to fall below zero this month and averaging about 7 degrees above normal.
“Dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills are forecast across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through early next week,” the Climate Prediction Center said. “Expect much below normal temperatures across the central/northern Plains to interior portions of the Pacific Northwest for the weekend into early next week.”
High temperatures will be in the single digits or even subzero range across much of the northern tier of the United States – between 25 to 40 degrees below normal. Overnight lows will be downright frigid, resulting in wind chill advisories being issued for portions of Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Montana.
“This would be the coldest weather since Christmas for this region, with locations from eastern Montana to northern Minnesota likely remaining below zero for highs Saturday through Monday, and perhaps into Tuesday,” the prediction center said.
These temperatures may come as a shock to many since most of January has been so mild. Chicago and Kansas City are both running more than 9 degrees above normal for the month, and Minneapolis and Oklahoma City are running at least 6 degrees above normal for January.
High temperatures will be dropping 20-30 degrees below average for many this weekend and into next week as frigid, arctic air pushes southward behind a cold front. Some moderate to heavy snow is also expected, especially across portions of the Rockies and Interior West. pic.twitter.com/pq3iMeLc5A
The dramatic shift from mild temperatures to bitter cold may catch people off guard.
Bozeman, Montana, for example, will go from a high of 33 degrees on Friday to a high of -3 on Sunday – with more than 40 straight hours below zero. Minneapolis will see a high of 33 degrees Friday plummet to a high of 3 degrees Monday. St. Louis will remain milder on Saturday, with a high temperature of 56. On Sunday, however, the high will fall to 36 degrees and eventually reach a low of 16 degrees Monday night.
Western cities will also witness dramatic drops. Denver will go from a high of 30 degrees on Saturday to a high of 7 degrees on Monday.
Add some wind, snow and ice
Air temperatures are not the only concern this weekend. Across much of the High Plains and Midwest, winds will be gusting 20 to 30 mph. While that may not seem very high, it doesn’t take much for frostbite to set in when the air temperature is already so cold.
“Wind chills could reach 40 below at times for these areas. Highs in the 0 to 10 degree range may extend as far south as northeast Colorado and northern Kansas,” the prediction center said.
At that range, exposed areas of skin can experience frostbite in just 10 to 15 minutes.
Another concern from that wind is its impact on snow storms. Blowing snow and reduced visibility will make travel difficult at times.
“The upper level wave train has another snow maker for us this weekend,” said the National Weather Service office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “There will be a good period of light to moderate snow for much of southern Wisconsin from midday Saturday through Saturday evening.”
Winter conditions started to affect travel in parts of the Midwest on Friday. A portion of Interstate 39/90 between the cities of Beloit and Janesville in Wisconsin was shut down due to an 85-car pileup Friday afternoon, according to the WIsconsin State Patrol.
At least 21 people were taken to area hospitals for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.
From Saturday into Sunday, snow is expected to spread from the Cascades to the Rockies and into the Great Lakes region. Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings are in place for over 18 million people.
Generally speaking, in southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois and much of Iowa there will be 2 to 4 inches of snow, though these quick but intense snow burst events make it difficult to pinpoint who will see the highest snowfall amounts.
“An additional narrow swath of 4-6” of snow, with locally higher totals, is forecast from northern Iowa through Lower Michigan by early Sunday,” the prediction center said.
While snow will be predominant a little farther south, along the Iowa/Missouri border, according to the National Weather Service office in Des Moines, the office warns that it will be possible to see “a brief period of freezing drizzle and very light glazing of ice Saturday afternoon.”
Snow will also fall this weekend across the Intermountain West. Most areas of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Colorado and northern Utah will see light to moderate snow through Monday. However, the heaviest snow will occur in the higher elevations of Wyoming and Colorado where multiple feet of snow are possible.

China’s northernmost city just saw its coldest day ever,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-mohe-record-low-temperature-intl-hnk/index.html,"China’s northernmost city just saw its coldest day ever
Temperatures in China’s northernmost city plunged to minus 53°C (minus 63.4 degrees Fahrenheit) – its coldest ever recorded, meteorologists said.
Located in the northeastern Heilongjiang province and nestled near Russian Siberia, Mohe is widely known as “China’s North Pole” and is one of the few places in the country to have a subarctic climate.
The temperature at 7am on January 22, also the first day of the Lunar New Year, registered at minus 53°C, according to the Heilongjiang Meteorological Bureau. It beat its previous record of minus 52.3°C in 1969, officials said.
China’s meteorological authority has forecast big temperature drops in parts of the country and issued a blue cold wave on Monday.
In neighboring Russia, Yakutsk, which has the distinction of being the world’s coldest city, saw temperatures plunge to minus 62.7°C (minus 80.9 degrees Fahrenheit) – the coldest in more than two decades.
Winters in Mohe are long and begin in early October, often lasting until May. Average temperatures during this period have been known to dip below freezing, experts said.
In 2018, rare “ice fog” – a weather phenomenon that occurs only in extreme cold climates when water droplets in air remain in liquid form – gripped residents, prompting local authorities to issue the city’s first-ever red warning for cold weather.
No alerts have been issued in Mohe yet but local meteorologists say the cold snap would continue into this week. Ice fog is also expected, they said.
The city’s constant cold attracts tourists all year round, who flock to its ice-themed attractions. In 2011, more than 10,000 tourists flocked to the city to observe the aurora borealis during the annual polar lights festival.
A highway connecting the remote city to the capital Beijing opened in December 2019 to much fanfare.

Climate change has worsened the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
Just months ago, China saw its worst heat wave since 1961 – which prompted massive power cuts and even reduced rivers to drought levels. The extreme heat stretched over 70 days and the impact was felt far and wide throughout large swathes of the country.

"The West’s snow boom could ease the water crisis. But experts worry more hot, dry weather is coming",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/21/us/west-snowpack-california-drought-climate/index.html,"The West’s snow boom could ease the water crisis. But experts worry more hot, dry weather is coming
A parade of storms has given the West some relief from its historic drought, replenishing the soil, filling reservoirs and increasing much-needed snowpack. But whether it will be enough to help lift the West out of its multi-year water crisis, experts say, depends on temperatures in the coming months.
Andrew Schwartz, lead scientist at the University of California, Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab, has been shoveling huge piles of snow at the lab site. The amount of snow the lab has received has been so excessive that it reached the second floor of their building, which they’ve since boarded up with plywood, he said.
The snow’s been “very exciting,” Schwartz said, and he is “cautiously optimistic” that it will go far to alleviate reservoir concerns this year, at least in California.
How deep is the #snow right now? Here's the view from our SECOND FLOOR windows.#California #CAwx #CAwater pic.twitter.com/J3vHZJaoB8
Across Western states, snowpack has reached more than 200% of normal levels in some places, with record-high amounts in the central Sierra Nevada. What’s already fallen there in the first couple of months of winter is what the region usually sees all the way through April 1.
But nearly 60% of the West is still in some level of drought. And as the rain and snow subsided earlier this week, experts now worry how long that white gold will last as conditions get hotter and drier.
“The numbers have been big, but we are still concerned that if we hit a prolonged dry and warm period, we may not end up in a spot that’s favorable come March and April,” Schwartz told CNN. “So cautious optimism is what we’re looking at, as water measurers and managers, because it’s been absolutely terrific so far. But we still have several months to get through in the water season.”
“These aren’t static numbers,” he added. “They can easily drop if we see record high temperatures.”
Less optimism for Colorado River
The West’s high-elevation snow is a natural reservoir, storing water throughout the cold winter months that then slowly trickles down into rivers and lakes in the spring and summer. But if temperatures start to warm before spring, that melting can start too early.
Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is critical, because it accounts for 30% of California’s freshwater supply in an average year, according to the California Department of Water Resources. The drying Colorado River Basin, which supplies water to roughly 40 million people in seven Western states and Mexico, also relies on snow-capped mountain ranges in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah for replenishment.
But with human-caused climate change transforming weather patterns around the world, cranking up temperatures and making droughts more severe and frequent, less water is flowing into rivers. Record-low water levels in the nation’s two largest reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have triggered mandatory water cuts for some Western states in the last year.
Schwartz said snowpack in parts of the Colorado River Basin is running above average. But he also said the region is going to need a lot more to make up for a yearslong deficit.
“The entire Western US snowpack is looking quite good right now,” Schwartz said. “Will it be enough to fill up Lake Mead or some of these other places that have been decimated? Likely not.”
So far, Lake Mead’s water levels have risen by a few feet, though Lake Powell has yet to see an increase.
California reservoirs increase
California’s recent storms significantly improved the surface drought there. It was only two weeks ago that nearly seven million Californians lived in areas of extreme drought – the second-worst designation. That number has since dropped to zero.
But Californians have seen this script before, and they know the pendulum can swing back hard the other way.
Just last January, the population in the state under extreme drought fell from over six million to under 20,000 after an extremely wet December. But that didn’t last long – by May, more than 14 million were in extreme drought, nearly half the state’s population.
We received 10"" (25.5 cm) of #snow over the last 24 hours. That puts us at 356.5"" (905.5 cm) for the entire season (Oct 1 - Sep 30) so far. We have clear conditions and they're expected to continue for the next 7  to 10 days. #CAwx #CAwater pic.twitter.com/AJjBLJWBLL
This year’s record-breaking, three-week deluge helped replenish some smaller reservoirs, bringing them back to historical averages, but many of the larger reservoirs – like Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville – remain below average for this time of the year.
“While precipitation over much of the state was over 300% of normal over the previous two weeks, deficits have been years in the making,” Deborah Bathke with the National Drought Mitigation Center wrote in Thursday’s drought report. “Historically, long-term drought is interrupted by a period of abnormally wet weather. However, it’s too early to tell if the wet weather is enough to end the drought.”
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said one thing that would concern him is if the West sees a series of warmer storms in the next couple months. One of the signatures of a warming climate, he said, is that storms in the region are becoming increasingly warmer, bringing rain instead of snow to higher elevations.
“That could be a problem because we do have such an enormous snowpack right now,” Swain told CNN. “Although right now, for the next two weeks, there is absolutely no indication of that at least, so that’s good.”
Groundwater crisis likely to continue
Beyond reservoirs, soil moisture has also been high, which is good for groundwater aquifers. But Swain said this moisture will not significantly alleviate the yearslong groundwater overdraft from the megadrought.
“This is not nearly enough, partly because it’s a supply and demand problem. We still got a lot of straws in the ground,” Swain said. “But you’d need multiple years like this in a row to really move the needle on recharging those aquifers. There’s probably some recharge going on right now, but it’s unlikely to be the very large amount that would be needed to really make a big difference there.”
Climate experts have long said that it’s a lack of precipitation, higher temperatures, and an increase in evaporative demand – also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere” – that has pushed the West’s drought into historic territory.
Swain warned that “thirstiness of the atmosphere” may likely be higher than it used to be, despite this wet year.
“Once things clear out and dry out,” he said, “the atmosphere is going to pull a lot of that water back out of the landscape faster than it used to.”

These 3 solutions could turn the tide on the climate crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/19/world/three-climate-solutions-wri-intl/index.html,"These 3 solutions could turn the tide on the climate crisis
Climate change is sending the world hurtling towards a series of catastrophic tipping points, which risk setting off feedback loops that lock the world into irreversible climate change. That’s the bad news.
The good news, however, is that there is also a series of “positive tipping points,” according to an analysis published Thursday by researchers from an international group of institutions including the University of Exeter and the World Resources Institute’s Systems Change Lab, with support from the Bezos Earth Fund.
These are defined as small climate actions that could have a snowball effect, prompting emissions cuts across some of most polluting sectors of the global economy.
The theory goes like this: As new technologies start to outpace older, more polluting versions, reinforcing feedback loops kick in that help a technology to improve, get cheaper and become more accessible.
The idea is to create “​​self-propelling change,” Tim Lenton, Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and a report author, told CNN.
The report authors acknowledge that triggering these tipping points alone will not be enough to meet global climate objectives. But as time runs out to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, targeted action can be a powerful lever, they say.
“In the face of an otherwise enormous climate and ecological crisis… maybe we can be part of change that will happen faster than we think,” Lenton said.
The report identifies three “super-leverage points”: Relatively low-cost or low-difficulty interventions that could have the biggest impacts in decarbonizing the global economy.
Electric vehicles
A tipping point is already “very close” for electric vehicles, the report says. EVs made up 10% of all cars sold last year, driven by sales in China and Europe.
To be on track for a net-zero fleet by 2050, EVs must account for around 60% of new passenger car sales by 2060, according to the report, which says mandates for EV sales could be a “particularly powerful policy” to bring forward a tipping point.
As demand ramps up, costs of production go down, including for lithium batteries, which have seen costs fall by 90% over the last 10 years, according to the report.
EVs overtaking gas-powered cars could also have positive spillover benefits for other sectors requiring battery storage, such as wind and solar.
“Electrifying cars means a tipping point for ever cheaper batteries, and cheaper batteries could be a really valuable, cheap source of storage of electricity to enable the transition to renewable power,” said Lenton.
Plant-based proteins
Meat has a huge climate impact. Livestock farming accounts for 14.5% of human-caused, planet-warming emissions.
Plant-based proteins – things like beans, lentils, peas and nuts – produce up to 90% fewer emissions than meat. They are also catching up with meat in terms of cost, as well as flavor. But they currently have a low market share.
If public institutions such as schools, hospitals and governments used their purchasing power to buy plant-based proteins instead of meat, this could be a “powerful lever to increase uptake of these products,” the report authors said.
This policy change could also help shift social norms around plant-based products and increase their appeal, Lenton said.
Moving away from animal products would have the added advantages of cutting farming emissions, freeing up land to support wildlife and carbon storage, and reducing incentives for deforestation.
Green fertilizer
Ramping up the production of “green fertilizer” could not only slash emissions from the production of agricultural fertilizer, but also help kickstart a green hydrogen economy, according to the report.
Ammonia, a key ingredient in commercial fertilizer, is currently produced using fossil fuels and accounts for about 1.8% of global carbon emissions. But it could be replaced by green ammonia, which is produced with green hydrogen using renewable energy.
While currently more expensive than conventional ammonia, green ammonia is projected to be economically viable within the decade, according to the report, which suggests mandates for 25% of ammonia to be green would help reduce food system emissions as well as speed up the growth of the green hydrogen sector.
Green hydrogen is a much-hyped climate solution because of its potential to replace fossil fuels in incredibly energy-intensive industries, such as shipping, steelmaking and aviation."
It’s now minus 80°F in the world’s coldest city,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/yakutsk-russia-cold-snap-freeze-intl-hnk/index.html,"It’s now minus 80°F in the world’s coldest city
Thought your winter was cold? Temperatures in the world’s coldest city have plunged to minus 62.7°C (minus 80.9 degrees Fahrenheit) – the coldest in more than two decades, meteorologists say.
That comes just two days after the city’s previously set record of minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit).
Yakutsk, the capital city of Russia’s Sakha Republic in eastern Siberia, is widely identified as being one of the coldest places in the world. Large parts of Russia are currently experiencing record low temperatures and Yakutsk is seeing an abnormally long cold snap.
January is the city’s coldest month and, although most are accustomed to freezing temperatures, residents in the remote region are taking extra precautions to keep warm.
Yakutsk winters can be extreme — even by Russian standards. And experts say that the extreme cold poses serious physical risks. The air is cold enough to numb exposed skin, making frostbite a constant hazard.
“You can’t fight (the cold),” one resident dressed in two scarves and multiple layers of gloves, hats and hoods told Reuters. “You either adjust and dress accordingly or you suffer.”
Layering, according to another resident selling frozen fish at a local market, was the key. “Just dress warmly. In layers, like a cabbage,” she said.
The city is shrouded in “ice fog” during winter. That occurs when “air is so cold that hot air from houses, people and cars cannot rise,” according to the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk.
“It is not a good idea to walk out in the streets in winter when the temperature falls below -40C,” the university wrote in an advisory to new incoming students.
In 2018, it got so cold that some residents said their eyelashes froze.
With a population of roughly 355,500, Yakutsk has become one of Russia’s most rapidly growing regional cities.
The city sits on continuous permafrost, a layer of frozen ground consisting of soil, gravel and sand that is usually bound together by ice under Earth’s surface. Many houses are built on concrete piles.
It is known for its history of mining activities in the region. Major exports include diamonds and coal.
Because of its intensely subarctic climate, tourism plays a smaller role in contributing to the local economy. But the city still attracts adventurous travelers wanting to experience life in the coldest place on earth.
Like in other parts of the world, climate change has had a major impact on Yakutsk. The city drew international attention in July 2022 when haze from nearby wildfires tore through forests, blanketing the region in thick smoke.
Scientists expressed grave concerns about the increasing frequency of the fires brought about by climate change in the Siberian arctic.

"Temperatures on Greenland haven’t been this warm in at least 1,000 years, scientists report",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/18/world/greenland-ice-sheet-warming-climate/index.html,"Temperatures on Greenland haven’t been this warm in at least 1,000 years, scientists report
As humans fiddle with the planet’s thermostat, scientists are piecing together Greenland’s history by drilling ice cores to analyze how the climate crisis has impacted the island country over the years. The further down they drilled, the further they went back in time, allowing them to separate which temperature fluctuations were natural and which were human-caused.
After years of research on the Greenland ice sheet – which CNN visited when the cores were drilled – scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that temperatures there have been the warmest in at least the last 1,000 years – the longest amount of time their ice cores could be analyzed to. And they found that between 2001 and 2011, it was on average 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the 20th century.
The report’s authors said human-caused climate change played a significant role in the dramatic rise in temperatures in the critical Arctic region, where melting ice has a considerable global impact.
“Greenland is the largest contributor currently to sea level rise,” Maria Hörhold, lead author of the study and a glaciologist with the Alfred Wegener Institute, told CNN. “And if we keep on going with the carbon emissions as we do right now, then by 2100, Greenland will have contributed up to 50 centimeters to sea level rise and this will affect millions of people who live in coastal areas.”
Weather stations along the edge of the Greenland ice sheet have detected that its coastal regions are warming, but scientists’ understanding of the effects of rising temperatures there had been limited due to the lack of long-term observations.
Understanding the past, Hörhold said, is important to prepare for future consequences.
“If you want to state something is global warming, you need to know what the natural variation was before humans actually interacted with the atmosphere,” she said. “For that, you have to go to the past – to the pre-industrial era – when humans have not been emitting [carbon dioxide] into the atmosphere.”
During pre-industrial times, there were no weather stations in Greenland that gathered temperature data like today. That’s why the scientists relied on paleoclimate data, such as ice cores, to study the region’s warming patterns.  The last robust ice core analysis in Greenland ended in 1995, and that data didn’t detect warming despite climate change already being apparent elsewhere, Hörhold said.
“With this extension to 2011, we can show that, ‘Well, there is actually warming,’” she added. “The warming trend has been there since 1800, but we had the strong natural variability that has been hiding this warming.”
Before humans began belching fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere, temperatures near 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Greenland were unheard of. But recent research shows that the Arctic region has been warming four times faster than the rest of the planet.
Significant warming in Greenland’s ice sheet is nearing a tipping point, scientists say, which could trigger catastrophic melting. Greenland holds enough ice that if it all melted, it could lift global sea levels by roughly 24 feet, according to NASA.
Although the study only covered temperatures through 2011, Greenland has seen extreme events since then. In 2019, an unexpectedly hot spring and a July heat wave caused almost the entire ice sheet’s surface to begin melting, shedding roughly 532 billion tons of ice into the sea. Global sea level would rise by 1.5 millimeters as a result, scientists reported afterward.
Then in 2021, rain fell at the summit of Greenland – roughly two miles above sea level – for the first time on record. The warm air then fueled an extreme rain event, dumping 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at Washington, DC’s National Mall nearly 250,000 times.
With these extreme events in Greenland happening more often, Hörhold said the team will continue to monitor the changes.
“Every degree matters,” Hörhold said. “At one point, we will go back to Greenland and we will keep on extending those records.”"
A major oil exporter is hosting a UN climate summit. Opinions are divided,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/16/middleeast/climate-change-cop28-mime-intl/index.html,"A major oil exporter is hosting a UN climate summit. Opinions are divided
Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in today’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN’s three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
This year’s COP28 climate summit is mired in controversy, held in one of the world’s biggest oil exporting nations – the United Arab Emirates – and headed by one of the most prominent faces in its oil industry.
Environmental activists have cried foul, arguing that the climate debate has been hijacked by the fossil fuel lobby to protect the profit-maximizing agendas of petrostates.
The UAE’s involvement has sparked a discussion  on whether there’s a place in the climate space for countries that rely primarily on fossil fuel exports for their income. And opinions are split.
Sultan Al Jaber, who will preside over the November summit, wears two very prominent hats in the UAE. Aside from being the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), he is also the UAE’s climate envoy, tasked with spearheading its energy policy. He took on the climate portfolio over a decade before becoming a top oil executive, helping launch the state’s clean energy company Masdar in 2006 and bringing the International Renewable Energy Agency’s headquarters to Abu Dhabi in 2009.
The message the UAE is sending is that both fossil fuels and renewable energy must be part of the global energy mix, and that one does not have to replace the other.
It has argued that given the projected growth in global energy demand, both clean and dirty energy will be needed to power the world, and a hasty transition away from oil and gas could have a detrimental effect on the global economy.
“Recent events have shown that unplugging the current energy system before we have built a sufficiently robust alternative puts both economic and climate progress at risk – and calls into question whether we can ensure a just transition that is equitable to all,” Al Jaber wrote last year in an opinion piece for Project Syndicate.
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates a nearly 50% increase in global energy use by 2050, with oil and gas remaining the most-consumed sources of energy.
Tom Evans, a policy adviser at the European climate change think tank E3G, told CNN that Al Jaber’s appointment raises questions about the credibility of the UAE’s COP28 presidency. “At face value, the head of a national oil company is obviously facing a massive conflict of interest,” he said.
Al Jaber’s dual roles are what make him a “terrific choice,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry was cited as saying by the Associated Press on Monday. The company he leads “knows it needs to transition,” Kerry  said.
Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Monday called the UAE’s hosting of the summit a “unique opportunity” at an environmental summit in Abu Dhabi. The UAE has the expertise “to get every sector, particularly those hard to abate, aligned with 1.5,” he said, referring to the climate goal to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.
The UAE has touted the mantra of “maximum energy, minimum emissions,” saying that instead of phasing out fossil fuels, it will work on making their extraction cleaner, and reinvest its revenues into renewable energy in an effort to raise its share of the nation’s energy mix. The country is future-proofing its energy sector and will “celebrate” the last barrel of oil it exports, Al Jaber said at an energy summit in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
Over the past 15 years, the UAE has invested $40 billion in renewable energy and clean technology globally, according to the Atlantic Council think tank. Last year, it entered a pact with the United States to invest another $100 billion in clean energy. Al Jaber on Saturday called for a tripling of renewable energy output around the world and twice as much money for adaptation in the global south.
But that’s not enough, climate experts say.
“Fossil fuel profits are most certainly not powering investments in clean energy,” Assaad Razzouk, a clean energy analyst in Singapore, told CNN. “Just look at the spending of oil and gas companies and how that’s allocated,” Razzouk said. Companies like ADNOC and Saudi Arabia’s Aramco oil company need to stop investing in oil and gas and spend much more on renewables if they are serious about the transition to clean energy, he added.
Global campaigner Corporate Accountability in November described the presence of oil lobbyists at climate summits as “a rise in the influence of the fossil fuel industry at the climate talks that are already rife with accusations of civil society censorship and corporate influence.”
Climate experts say the UAE’s approach of expanding the use of renewables while continuing to extract fossil fuels defies its own commitments. COP28 didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.
“The Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 in 2021 by all countries, including the UAE, calls for a cut of 45% in carbon emissions by 2030,” Mark Maslin, a professor working on climate change at University College London, told CNN. “This can only be achieved if there is no new investment in fossil fuels and the use of all fossil fuels is phased out as soon as possible.”
“So it does not make any sense to invest in fossil fuels when the world needs to be net zero emissions before 2050,” he added.
But the UAE is doing quite the opposite.
One of the few producers in the OPEC oil cartel with the capacity to ramp up production on short notice, the UAE  has repeatedly called for more investment in the oil sector to meet global demand, and has embarked on a project to further increase its own capacity. In November, it brought forward its oil production expansion to 2027 instead of 2030, when it will be producing up to 5 million barrels per day (bpd) from about 4 million.
The UAE’s approach has been pragmatic, said Amena Bakr, chief OPEC correspondent at Energy Intelligence, adding that Russia’s war on Ukraine led nations to prioritize energy security and realize that the world couldn’t do away with oil and gas so soon.
“Renewable energy still cannot meet base-load energy demand – that’s a fact,” she told CNN.
For Razzouk, the clean energy analyst, the conflict has “incontrovertibly shown the folly of relying on imported fossil fuels, and the national security risks this entailed.”

Iran hangs British citizen on charges of espionage and corruption
A dual British-Iranian citizen was hanged by Iran on charges of espionage and corruption, a state-affiliated media outlet reported Saturday, the latest in a string of executions carried out by a regime grappling with unprecedented protests across the country. Alireza Akbari was executed for crimes including “corruption on earth,” according to the Iranian judiciary-affiliated outlet Mizan. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “appalled by the execution.” Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Saturday afternoon that the British government planned to sanction Iran’s Prosecutor General to underline “our disgust at Alireza Akbari’s execution.”
More than 80,000 turn out for Tel Aviv protest against Netanyahu government
Despite pouring rain, tens of thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv Saturday night against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government’s proposed changes to the judicial system. Others took to the streets in Jerusalem for parallel protests. Attendees held signs comparing Netanyahu to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and saying Israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic Hungary and theocratic Iran.
Syria sets conditions for rapprochement with Turkey
Syrian foreign minister Faisal Mekdad said on Saturday that Turkey would have to end its military presence in his country to achieve a full rapprochement, Reuters reported. “We cannot talk about resuming normal ties with Turkey without removing the occupation, without ending terrorism and returning the relations to the state that they were based on the first place,” he said after meeting his Iranian counterpart in Damascus.
$30 billion
The UAE will invest $30 billion in South Korea, Reuters cited South Korea’s presidential office as saying on Sunday. The decision was announced as South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol met his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, in Abu Dhabi during a four-day visit. Yoon’s press secretary said the investment will be directed at nuclear power, defense, hydrogen and solar energy industries, among others.

Saudi Arabia: #Naturalizing_children_of_female_citizens
Saudis on Twitter have been discussing a change in the kingdom’s citizenship law that was misinterpreted by some as easing the process of naturalization for the children of Saudi women.
In most Arab countries, only men can pass on citizenship to their children automatically, which women’s rights activists have campaigned for decades to change. In Saudi Arabia, the children of Saudi women married to foreigners don’t get Saudi citizenship at birth but have the right to apply for it after the age of 18 if they meet certain conditions.
The change in the Saudi citizenship law last week moved the authority to grant citizenship from the interior minister to the prime minister, but didn’t change the rules to obtain citizenship.
Some regional news outlets falsely reported that the changes eased the rules of naturalization, prompting the topic to trend on Twitter in Saudi Arabia, with many praising the move and others warning of the demographic imbalance it could cause. The inaccurate reporting however sparked a debate on the topic, with many calling on the government to allow women to pass on citizenship to their children at birth.
“I support this move because I consider the Saudi woman to be equal to the Saudi man, with all the rights and obligations as those Saudi men who marry foreign women and naturalize their children,” Saudi writer Mohammed Alkhalid said in a video posted on Twitter.
Oil rich Gulf Arab countries have very strict naturalization procedures. Of the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council, four have a majority expatriate population, with citizens accounting for less than 20% of the population in countries like the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

My 13-year-old daughter and I walked along the flooded banks of the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz, surveying the damage of the latest storm. There were large pieces of driftwood and other detritus swirling in the brown, rushing current.
“What do you think is worse: the floods or the fires?” I asked her.
She didn’t need to pause for long before answering. “Definitely the fires because of the smell,” she said.
It was, to be fair, an impossible choice – especially for a child barely into her teens. The apocalyptic weather in California is upending all of our lives, but that’s true for no one more so than for our kids.
Julianna has lived in California for all of her life and has learned to live with the temperamental, destructive nature of its environment. In August 2020, the CZU Lightning Complex Fire ignited the mountain areas near our house.
Crews have been busy in recent days clearing neighborhoods and roadways destroyed by heavy downpours and strong winds, forcing thousands of evacuations. Forecasters say another round of unprecedented rain could soon be on its way, and new devastation emerges almost before the debris has been cleared away.
The storms that have buffeted my home state in recent weeks have left at least 17 people dead as much of the state received rainfall totals 400% to 600% above average.
In 2020, relentless wildfires saw more than 80,000 acres burn and more than 900 homes destroyed leaving blackened scars that are still visible when we drive along the sweeping cliffs of the Pacific Coast Highway.
We were fortunate that our rental home was miles away from the evacuation zones. But smoke throughout the region was so pervasive and so severe that we needed to stay inside for days at a stretch with the windows closed and a MacGyvered box fan-turned-air purifier running at all times.
The fires hit during the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the terrible air quality, meant we lost access to nature at the time when we needed it the most. So we stayed inside and watched news reports of the destruction.
Now, there’s no telling how much new damage we’ll see each day when we emerge from our homes. With this current disaster, as with the last, we’re experiencing a familiar feeling of doom. Schools are canceling classes this week amid flooding so severe that it has washed away cliff faces, as well as the bridges we’re used to crossing every day.
Scientists may debate whether the latest series of storms is due to climate change, but there’s no doubt that the Golden State is being hit by more extreme weather events. That has meant that all of us – at every age – have had to become more familiar with tell-tale signs of impending bad weather.
Any child who lives here can tell you that you need to plan for potential smoke in the fall because the dry, drought-ravaged hillsides can spark in a moment. Now, Julianna will also have the memory of what it’s like to watch basic infrastructure like roads and bridges wash away from the rain.
The World Health Organization has said that climate change poses a threat to mental health and well-being. Even among adults, the extreme conditions create a hypervigilance that can never completely be turned off. You try to fall back asleep after being awakened in the middle of the night by howling winds – or the stifling heat or the pounding rain – but your brain starts to imagine the life-threatening devastation.
The emotional strain can be even greater for young people. The deadly heat, fires and flooding wrought by climate change have spawned an ever-present eco-anxiety in youth. In a 2021 survey of teens and young adults, 60% of respondents said they felt “very worried” or “extremely worried” about climate change. The survey polled 10,000 young people in 10 countries about climate change and how well they felt their government responses to it have been.
When asked how they felt about our volatile climate, the most commonly chosen answers were “sad,” “afraid,” “anxious,” “angry” and “powerless.” Overall, 45% of participants said their feelings about climate change impacted their daily lives.
I know what it’s like to live without those worries, but my daughter does not. They have become a part of her, like the freckles that emerge on her face after days in the California sunlight.
In a region that has seen massive devastation from both fire and flood in the space of a few short years, it’s shocking to witness how quickly a landscape can change. As Julianna’s 13-year-old friend Talula put it, “The storm has a thundering effect on the people around us, and it rains down on the unfortunate more than anyone else.”
In addition to learning about the impermanence of things around us that once seemed immutable and the destructive power of nature, my daughter and her peers are also learning that rebuilding takes time. It’s a slow process to bring back what’s been violently destroyed.
So far, more than 100 permits have been issued to rebuild the houses that were destroyed by the fire – but that’s just a fraction of the number of dwellings destroyed. Many of the state parks that burned have only recently reopened.
Now, the recovery from these storms will cost tens of millions and will be a years-long process.
That kind of work happens on a community level, for those who stick it out. Some people I know have chosen to leave the area rather than rebuild from the fires. Others keep an extensive emergency evacuation bag constantly ready.
Long after Covid-19 is endemic, my family will still have KN95 masks and air purifiers in the house in anticipation of next year’s wildfire season. We will likely stay close to home during the rainy season, just in case. These are just the realities of raising a child in California in the 21st century. As more of these mass climate events happen in coming years, it is the children who will have to deal with the fall out.
A few days ago, after one of the storms splintered Santa Cruz’s Capitola Wharf, a beloved local landmark, we drove the mile or so from our house to take a look. We drive past it several times a week, and it was shocking to see the way part of it had fallen off into the ocean.
The businesses at the end of the wharf were cut off from the rest of the city. We surveyed the damage as tourists and photojournalists snapped photos and children built forts with driftwood from a nearby beach.
“They’ll fix it, right?” Julianna finally asked.
Join us on Twitter and Facebook
“Yes, I’m sure they will. But all the cleanup will cost millions,” I answered.
“But there are only a few businesses there,” she said, already doing the complicated math in her head. Did the historic nature of the landmark warrant the cost and effort?
This is the legacy our children will be left with. They will be engaged in a never-ending question of weights and balance, making difficult choices about what we rebuild and what gets washed away for good."

If you watch the news today, you’d be forgiven for thinking that we live in dark times. Impending climate change, overpopulation, political discord, conflict in Ukraine and threats of nuclear war all paint a bleak picture.
But this week delivered some refreshingly good news: The World Meteorological Organization released a very hopeful report stating that humanity and all life on Earth dodged a bullet. The Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed in 1987, regulated the consumption and production of almost 100 chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that created a hole in the ozone layer and endangered the planet’s entire ecosystem. More than three decades later, the use of CFCs has decreased by 99%, and the Earth’s ozone layer is on track to recover in the coming decades.
This success gives some of us hope that we might employ a similar approach to mitigate today’s very pressing danger arising from climate change.
In 1974, chemists Frank Rowland and Mario Molina found that carelessly recycled refrigerators and ordinary hair spray posed an existential threat to life on Earth. The coolant in refrigerators and the propellant in spray cans were made of CFCs that, when mixed in air, rose to the very top of the atmosphere. There, the CFCs underwent chemical interactions that destroyed the ozone.
The layer of ozone gas high above the Earth’s surface acts as a shield against the most dangerous forms of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation can be deadly to life – humans use it to sterilize water, kill unwanted pathogens in hospital operating rooms, and sanitize everything from toothbrushes to cell phones.
If the ozone were to disappear, dangerous solar ultraviolet light would make it to the Earth’s surface. In humans and animals, it would cause melanoma and cataracts. In plants, it would affect the ability to grow and produce fruits and vegetables. Perhaps most dangerously, it would kill phytoplankton in the ocean. Given that phytoplankton is the foundation of marine food chains, much of the life in the ocean would also die.
In the face of this threat, the international community took notice and, in 1987, signed the Montreal Protocol. The protocol, which established practical targets, regulated both the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, gave states flexibility in how they would meet those goals and created a fund that provided financial and technical support for developing countries to comply with the agreement.
Since then, scientists have been monitoring the size of the ozone hole, which is shrinking. The success of the Montreal Protocol shows that world leaders can address global, existential problems by working together toward a common goal.
CFCs, of course, are not the only way humans have endangered the Earth’s ecosystems. Indeed, the emission of carbon dioxide now poses a much greater danger. By burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, humans are pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a rate of over 35 billion tons per year. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration over the past few decades has raised it to levels not seen over the past million years.
Carbon dioxide is called a “greenhouse gas,” because it acts like a greenhouse, trapping heat under it. This causes the surface of the Earth to heat up, leading to changes in the climate. Previously habitable places become drier or wetter. A hotter Earth leads to glaciers melting, rising sea levels and the flooding of low-lying coastal areas. Island nations like Kiribati could disappear altogether.
These disruptive climate changes are having a significant impact on humanity, including droughts in the American West, with rampant wildfires and emptying reservoirs. More heat in the atmosphere is also causing  more intense and destructive hurricanes, with attendant damage to houses and businesses.
Carbon emissions are not due to any one nation. While historically the main emitter was the US, today it is China, with the US, the European Union, India, Russia and Japan being other leaders in this unwelcome ranking. No one country can fix this problem. What is needed is international negotiation and agreement to move humanity to other sources of energy beyond fossil fuels.
Certainly, the governments of the world have tried. In 2015, nearly 200 nations signed an accord signed in Paris, agreeing in principle to address the carbon dioxide emission problem. Under President Donald Trump, the US withdrew from the pact in 2020, although it rejoined in 2021 when President Joe Biden took office. However, speed bumps like these should not deter the nations of the world. We know the problem and we have shown that we can cooperate when there is an existential threat to civilization. The example of successful CFC mitigation provides a blueprint – at least in spirit – for humanity to work together for the better of us all.

Carbon dioxide is an enormous danger to humanity and civilization. It is an international problem, requiring an international solution, and the success of the agreement banning CFCs gives us some hope that humanity will once again rise to the occasion."

Exxon accurately predicted global warming from 1970s – but continued to cast doubt on climate science, new report finds
ExxonMobil’s own scientists accurately predicted future global warming in reports dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, despite the company publicly continuing for years to cast doubt on climate science and lobby against climate action, according to a new analysis.
Researchers examined climate projections produced between 1977 and 2003 by Exxon, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies. They found the company’s science was not only good enough to predict long term temperature rise, but also accurately predicted when human-caused climate change would become discernible, according to the report published Thursday in the journal Science.
A slew of internal Exxon documents unearthed by researchers and journalists over the past few years have shown that the company was aware of the link between fossil fuels and climate change at least as far back as the 1970s.
But until now, there hasn’t been an in-depth review of Exxon’s own climate modeling data, said Geoffrey Supran, a research fellow in the history of science at Harvard University and a co-author of the report.
This is “the first-ever systematic assessment of the fossil fuel industry’s climate projections,” Supran told CNN.
The researchers analyzed more than 100 reports by Exxon scientists, produced between 1977 and 2014. They then whittled these down to 12 documents containing climate projections and compared them against historical observations.
Between 63% to 83% of the projections were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming and their projections were also consistent with independent academic models, the report found.
The company’s climate modeling showed “shocking skill and accuracy,” Supran said.
Exxon projected an average warming of around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, according to the report.
“That allows us for the first time to put a number on what Exxon knew, namely that fossil fuel burning was going to hit the planet by 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade,” Supran said.
Exxon was “on the money” on various other topics, said Supran, including accurately predicting that human-caused climate change would be first detectable around the year 2000, as well as estimating how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming.
“I see this as ‘Exxon knew 2.0,’” Supran said, referring to the #ExxonKnew campaign launched by climate activists in the wake of earlier revelations that Exxon has long known about the link between its products and climate change.
“We now have tight, unimpeachable evidence that ExxonMobil accurately predicted global warming years before it turned around and publicly attacked climate science,” Supran said.
Todd Spitler, a spokesperson for Exxon, said in a statement that “ExxonMobil is committed to being part of the solution to climate change and the risks it poses,” and “those who talk about how ‘Exxon knew’ are wrong.”
Addressing Exxon’s climate research, Spitler said the company has produced “nearly 150 papers, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications that the Company has made available to the public.”
“ExxonMobil’s understanding of climate science has developed along with that of the broader scientific community,” he said.
Casting ‘doubt and uncertainty’
Despite its own modeling showing fossil fuel use would lead to global warming, Exxon’s public communications raised doubt about climate change, including taking out ads in major publications suggesting climate science was poorly understood and scientists were divided.
“When the company was making these claims about doubt and uncertainty through at least the early 2010s, they were doing so in full awareness that their own science contradicted those claims,” Supran said.
A 2017 peer-reviewed study, which Supran co-authored, examined nearly 190 public and private communications from the company and found that while the majority of internal documents acknowledged human-caused global warming, most of its public statements expressed doubt.
Exxon rejected these findings at the time as “inaccurate and preposterous.”
In 2021, a then Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, was captured on an undercover video appearing to confirm that the company sought to undermine climate action.
“Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes,” McCoy said in the video, filmed by Unearthed, Greenpeace UK’s investigative journalism arm.
Exxon condemned McCoy’s statements at the time, saying that they did not reflect the company’s position on climate.
The company, which made a record $58 billion in profits in 2022 according to preliminary data, has since expressed a commitment to the Paris climate agreement pledge to keep global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It has also committed to reach net-zero emissions for its operated assets by 2050 – meaning it will remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as its operations emit.
“ExxonMobil is actively engaged in efforts to reduce emissions while providing affordable energy to the communities that need it,” Spitler said.
Exxon was one of the companies highlighted in a year-long investigation in the US by the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee into climate disinformation from fossil fuel companies, published in December. It found that the industry is “posturing on climate issues while avoiding real commitments.” At the time, Spitler issued a statement saying the committee took internal Exxon communications out of context, saying they represented “well intended, internal policy debates.”
Climate litigation
The report’s findings could potentially help support climate litigation against Exxon, Daniel Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN. (According to the study’s disclosures, one of the authors had previously served as a paid consultant to a law firm that has filed legal complaints against Exxon and other fossil fuel companies, though that law firm “played no role in this or any other study by the authors,” including in their funding.)
Cities, counties and states across the United States have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, accusing them of deceiving the public about their role in accelerating climate change. Exxon has said these lawsuits have no merit.
“The more we learn about industry deception, the stronger the legal claims will be,” he said.
Thursday’s analysis could also alter public perceptions of the company, Farber said: “Over time the company’s image may erode as the stream of disclosures eats away at its reputation.”
This story has been updated to note the study’s competing interests disclosure.

"UAE appoints oil company boss as president of the COP28 climate conference, alarming climate groups",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/12/world/cop28-uae-sultan-al-jaber-president-climate-intl/index.html,"UAE appoints oil company boss as president of the COP28 climate conference, alarming climate groups
The United Arab Emirates has appointed the head of one of the world’s largest oil producers to preside over the UN’s COP28 climate summit, in a move activists warned could undermine this year’s global conference.
Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, will oversee COP28, which takes place from November 30 in Dubai. Political leaders and representatives from more than 190 countries will congregate to discuss how to put the world on course to meet the Paris Climate Agreement ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Announcing Al Jaber’s appointment, the UAE praised his climate credentials, including his position as the country’s climate change envoy and role as founder of the renewable energy company Masdar.
“The UAE is approaching COP28 with a strong sense of responsibility and the highest possible level of ambition,” Al Jaber said in a statement.
The UAE, a big oil producer, has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, meaning it would remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits.
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the appointment.
“I am confident that Dr Sultan has both the standing and the capability to offer groundbreaking leadership for COP28,” he said in a statement.
The appointment has caused a backlash among some climate groups, given the role fossil fuels play in driving climate change.
Climate organizations have said at Al Jaber’s appointment would undermine the possibility of achieving ambitious climate pledges and some have called for Al Jaber to relinquish his oil industry job to take this post.
The appointment raises questions about the credibility of the UAE’s COP28 presidency, said Tom Evans, a policy advisor at the European climate change think tank E3G. “At face value, the head of a national oil company is obviously facing a massive conflict of interest,” he told CNN.
Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network International said in a statement: “[Al Jaber] cannot preside over a process that is tasked to address the climate crisis with such a conflict of interest, heading an industry that is responsible for the crisis itself.”
She added: “If he does not step down as CEO [of Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation], it will be tantamount to a full scale capture of the UN climate talks by a petrostate national oil company and its associated fossil fuel lobbyists.”
Last year’s COP27 ended with countries affirming the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but a proposal to phase out fossil fuels was blocked by countries including China and Saudi Arabia. Climate campaigners accused the fossil fuel industry of exercising outsized influence at the summit, which was attended by more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists.
“For the summit hosts to be taken seriously as honest brokers for change, they need to go above and beyond to avoid a conflict of interest,” UK-based humanitarian group ActionAid said in a statement. “This is vital for the safety and protection of our planet. Unfortunately, COP28 looks like it is off to a bad start in that regard.”
However, others have said Al Jaber’s appointment is not a surprise as he has been at the forefront of renewable energy advocacy in the region.
“He was the CEO of Abu Dhabi’s clean energy vehicle, he is still chairman of Masdar and he recently took a stake in renewables and hydrogen business,” Robin Mills, CEO of Dubai-based energy consulting firm Qamar Energy, told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “So what we are seeing here is a well thought out and long-term strategy, and energy diversity which emphasizes climate compatibility.”
Al Jaber, who is the first CEO to ever hold a COP presidency according to the UAE’s statement, said: “[COP28] will be a critical moment to mobilize political will to respond to what the science tells us will need to be achieved to remain on target and limit global warming to 1.5C by 2050.”

2022 was the warmest La Niña year on record. Scientists say this year will be warmer,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/12/us/2022-warmest-la-nina-year-climate/index.html,"2022 was the warmest La Niña year on record. Scientists say this year will be warmer
Twin reports released Thursday by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the last nine years were the hottest nine on record, with 2022 being the warmest La Niña year ever recorded.
That’s significant, scientists said, since the La Niña phenomenon typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures.
NASA also reported that 2022 was the fifth-warmest year on record for the entire planet, echoing similar findings from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which CNN reported earlier this week.
“In the pattern of climate change, the long-term trends, we’re seeing this overall warming pretty much everywhere, with perhaps an exception in the deepest southern oceans around Antarctica,” Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA, told CNN.

Let it flood, scientists say‘A world rapidly warming’: The past eight years were the eight warmest on record for planetExtreme weather has cost the US more than $1 trillion in the past seven years, feds reportGreat Salt Lake will disappear in 5 years without massive ‘emergency rescue,’ scientists say‘The brink of disaster’: 2023 is a critical year for the Colorado River as reservoirs sink toward ‘dead pool’
“And unfortunately, we’re predicting that 2023 will actually be warmer than 2022,” he said.
Planet-warming fossil fuel emissions have pushed the planet’s average temperature to 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is nearly 75% of the way to the 1.5-degree threshold scientists warn it should stay under.
These aren’t small numbers, Schmidt said.
Even at 1.1 degrees, 2022 made abundantly clear the dangers of a warming planet that many are not prepared for, including a deadly heat wave that seared much of Europe, catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, a devastating hurricane in Florida, and historic droughts that are draining freshwater supply in many parts of the globe.
“What we’re predicting – if we were to burn all the fossil fuels that we can – it could get as warm, by the end of the century, as the Ice Age was cold,” Schmidt said.
The NOAA analysis also noted that ocean temperatures were at a record high in 2022, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. The last four years have been the warmest four on record for the planet’s oceans.
Additionally, researchers found that the extent of Antarctic sea ice was at a near-record low in 2022, second only to 1987 with a smaller annual sea ice extent – an alarming development that threatens the region’s plants and animals, including its iconic penguins.
From slashing the use of fossil fuels to retrofitting buildings to be more climate-efficient, Schmidt said the world already has the proper tools in place to address the worst of the climate crisis. It’s just a matter of using them fast enough.
“It’s clear that people are taking this more seriously than they were a decade ago,” he said. “But let’s not sugarcoat how big a challenge this is. It’s not a challenge for a week or a year or a decade. It’s going to be the challenge of the century.”"
Contrails are a problem for aviation – but there could be an easy solution,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/contrails-aviation-climate-change-satavia-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"Contrails are a problem for aviation – but there could be an easy solution
On a clear day, with the right weather conditions, a portion of the sky busy with commercial flights can become riddled with contrails, the wispy ice clouds that form as jet aircraft fly by.
They might look innocuous, but they’re not – contrails are surprisingly bad for the environment. A study that looked at aviation’s contribution to climate change between 2000 and 2018 concluded that contrails create 57% of the sector’s warming impact, significantly more than the CO2 emissions from burning fuel. They do so by trapping heat that would otherwise be released into space.
And yet, the problem may have an apparently straightforward solution. Contrails – short for condensation trails, which form when water vapor condenses into ice crystals around the small particles emitted by jet engines – require cold and humid atmospheric conditions, and don’t always stay around for long. Researchers say that by targeting specific flights that have a high chance of producing contrails, and varying their flight path ever so slightly, much of the damage could be prevented.
Adam Durant, a volcanologist and entrepreneur based in the UK, is aiming to do just that. “We could, in theory, solve this problem for aviation within one or two years,” he says.
Durant has long studied how atmospheric contaminants affect the health of aircraft engines, and after the 2010 eruption of an Icelandic volcano brought aviation to a standstill, he embarked on a project with Airbus and easyJet to research volcanic ash. In 2013 he founded his own company, Satavia, initially focusing on preserving engines from damaging pollutants like dust, ice and volcanic ash. “Then, Covid shifted the priorities of the whole industry towards sustainability,” he says.
Oversized impact
Satavia pivoted to tackling contrails, by developing a weather prediction model that can forecast the conditions that lead to their formation. Of contrails’ climate impact, “80 or 90% is coming from only maybe five to 10% of all flights,” says Durant. “Simply redirecting a small proportion of flights can actually save the majority of the contrail climate impact.”
The approach Satavia is taking is to target those five to 10% of flights on any given day and modify their flight plans before the aircraft have even taken off. That means changing their altitude or route to avoid flying through parts of the atmosphere which are prone to forming persistent contrails.
“The airlines go ahead and make flight plans as they normally do. But in parallel to that, we analyze their schedule and look at a number of flow trajectories for every single flight,” Durant says. “We end up with a long list of flights of which the top 5% or so have these heavy hitter, long-lived warming contrails. And then we work closely with the flight ops department in the airline to target those.”
The challenge is working around limitations on flight time and fuel consumption. “There are obviously very tight limits on flight time: we have to stay within five minutes of the original intended arrival time. That’s non-negotiable,” Durant says.
As for fuel use, Durant aims to either have no impact on consumption, or keep it within tenths of a percent of the regular flight plan. “If a particular flight has a 0.1 or 0.2% fuel penalty to save potentially hundreds of tons of CO2, that’s fairly negligible but the benefits are huge. There’s a big upside to this if it’s done in the correct way.”
A concerted effort
The first commercial flight utilizing Satavia technology took off in October 2021 and was operated by United Arab Emirates carrier Etihad as part of a program called Greenliner, a testbed for sustainability projects. Since then, Etihad and Satavia have completed dozens of flights, and Satavia is about to start another trial with Dutch flagship operator KLM. “We are going to be actively looking for more airlines in 2023 to work with, as we start scaling up the service that we offer,” Durant says.
In 2021, scientists calculated that addressing the contrail problem would cost under $1 billion a year, but provide benefits worth more than 1,000 times as much. And a study from Imperial College London showed that diverting just 1.7% of flights could reduce the climate damage of contrails by as much as 59%.
According to Marc Stettler, one of the authors of the Imperial College study, who’s not involved with Satavia, the company is on the right track. “I’m all in favor of conducting trials. There are things that we still need to improve and learn, but the industry has started to rightly take this as a high priority, so there’s a number of airlines who are active in this space, including the ones that are working with Satavia,” he says.
However, he adds, the problem requires a concerted effort. “This needs to be collaborative. Satavia are doing good work by initiating these trials themselves and they have to be able to sustain themselves as a commercial organization, but they’re open for collaboration.”
In late November, the Rocky Mountain Institute, a non-profit energy think tank based in the US, launched a cross sector task force to address the contrail problem. Boeing, Airbus and a half dozen airlines including American and United are currently on board, along with researchers and academics. It aims to develop solutions and establish a roadmap to implement them.
Durant is receptive to the idea of collaboration. “We really need action across the industry, we need the operators to come together and work with us. We could do something tangible. We could seriously reduce, say, 50% of the industry’s contrails impact by 2030. That’s totally attainable, because we can do it with software and analytics,” he says.
The challenges ahead, Durant adds, can’t be solved without the involvement of regulatory bodies. “It’s not just about the science – it’s also about how we do this in practice. The rules will need to be updated to allow greater flexibility for both where aircraft fly and how we organize air traffic. And that’s going to be our biggest problem to solve.”"
"Ocean heat hit another record high in 2022, fueling extreme weather",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/world/oceans-warmest-on-record-climate-intl/index.html,"Ocean heat hit another record high in 2022, fueling extreme weather
The world’s oceans were the warmest on record for the fourth year in row in 2022, a troubling sign of the climate crisis caused by humans pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.
A study by an international team of scientists from 16 institutes worldwide found that the five hottest years for oceans all happened in the past six years and that the speed at which oceans are warming is getting increasingly fast.
Published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on Wednesday, the study looked at temperatures from the ocean surface to 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) deep, examining data going back to the 1950s.
The results are worrying. “The state of our oceans can measure the world’s health, and judging by the updated oceanic observations … we need a doctor,” the team of authors said in an accompanying press release.
In terms of energy, the amount of heat added to the oceans in 2022 is equivalent to 100 times the total global electricity generation last year, the researchers said.
Oceans serve as a good indicator of the real impact of climate change because compared to air temperatures, they are less affected by seasonal changes and day-to-day weather cycles. Covering almost three quarters of Earth’s surface, oceans absorb the vast majority of the world’s heat.
Since 1970, more than 90% of the planet’s excess heat went into the oceans, the study said.
The scientists said that the global long-term warming trend is now so steady and robust that annual records continue to be set every year.
“Until we reach net zero emissions, that heating will continue, and we’ll continue to break ocean heat content records, as we did this year. Better awareness and understanding of the oceans are a basis for the actions to combat climate change,” said Michael Mann, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the authors of the study.
Why ocean warming matters
Warming oceans have a major impact on the lives of millions of people. They supercharge weather patterns to create more powerful storms, hurricanes and intense rainfall and make it easier for storms to rapidly intensify, as happened with Hurricane Ian, which hit the Caribbean and Florida in late September.
The warming is also a key driver of sea level rise, because extra heat causes oceans to expand. When water gets warmer, its molecules move faster and spread out more, which increases its volume. This leads to more coastal erosion and storm surges – such as when Hurricane Nicole hit Florida’s Daytona Beach area in November.
Rising temperatures also mean ocean waters have less oxygen, which affects marine life, hurting fishing communities and their economies.
It’s not just the oceans that are warming rapidly. An analysis by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service published on Tuesday showed that last eight years have been the eight warmest on record, as the growing concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere pushes global temperatures toward a dangerous tipping point.

"Extreme weather has cost the US more than $1 trillion in the past seven years, feds report",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/weather/billion-dollar-weather-disasters-noaa-climate/index.html,"Extreme weather has cost the US more than $1 trillion in the past seven years, feds report
The United States was lashed by 18 catastrophic extreme weather and climate disasters costing at least $1 billion each last year, a new report shows. They came in the form of tornadoes, extreme heat and cold, deadly flooding and hurricanes and a climate change-fueled drought in the West.
When taken together, the country’s so-called billion-dollar disasters inflicted at least $165 billion in damage last year — surpassing 2021 disasters in cost — and caused at least 474 deaths, according to the report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Hurricane Ian, the Category 4 storm that left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean and Florida, carried the highest economic toll of nearly $113 billion, along with a death toll of 152, NOAA reported.
The second-costliest disaster was a blistering summer heat wave and the historic drought, which spread from the West to the Mississippi River, totaling about $22.2 billion in damages.
Over the last seven years, 122 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,000 people and cost the US more than $1 trillion in damages, the agency said.

At the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society this week, where NOAA officials will present their findings, scientists say the fingerprints of climate change are all over these extreme weather disasters.
“What we’ve learned over the past 20 years is that extreme events are the face of climate change,” Stephanie Herring, climate scientist at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, told journalists on Monday.
People may not notice a small change in global average temperature, Herring said, but those changes “have huge impacts” on the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
Five of the last six years, except 2019, have seen disasters exceed the $100-billion mark, a signal that extreme weather events are becoming more costly and destructive as climate change accelerates.
“We’re talking big money here and it’s consistent,” Adam Smith, applied climatologist with NOAA who led the report, told CNN. “This is another trend where the cost and the impacts are quite large and so we need to think about how to better mitigate future damages because we know these extremes will continue to happen.”
Last year’s financial toll was third-highest on record so far, behind 2020 and 2021. But Smith noted the total cost could rise several billion dollars once NOAA accounts for the damages of the late-December blizzard and cold snap.
“We’re still calculating the cost of that event, which was so late in the year, but it’s clearly a several billion-dollar event and will actually add to the total we already have of $165 billion,” Smith said. “So the total of 2022 will actually exceed $165 once we add the Christmas, winter storm impacts on top of that number.”
Last year closed with a series of disastrous storms in the West, and California is still being hammered by torrential rain, causing destructive flooding. Scientists have found climate change is not just increasing the severity of extreme weather, it is interrupting the usual patterns and causing wild swings between dry and wet extremes. In California, the multiyear drought has dried out the land so intensely, it is less able to absorb heavy rainfall, making flooding more likely.
Smith underscored a few main factors contributing to the growing economic toll, including how people continue to move into harm’s way and the increased vulnerability given where and how structures are built.
And then there’s the climate crisis: “Climate change is intensifying many of these extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters,” Smith said.
President Joe Biden in August signed the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which contains $370 billion for climate and clean energy tax credits and new programs. Analysts and estimates from the lawmakers show the law would significantly cut planet-warming emissions, which scientists say would ultimately lead to fewer and less-extreme climate disasters.
The funding, which is designed to be applied over the course of 10 years, pales in comparison to what the US is now spending each year on disasters.
“Time is of the essence,” Smith said. “Because all of these extremes, impacts, disasters, and fatalities have happened, there’s so many different lessons across many parts of the country, for many different disaster types and many different populations that we can start to implement. And sooner is certainly better.”
NOAA’s annual report only captures the costliest disasters and serves as a snapshot to quantify the toll of extreme weather and climate change across the US. Globally, extreme weather events in 2022 cost roughly $270 billion, new data from reinsurance company Munich Re shows. Hurricane Ian was the costliest disaster in Munich Re’s report, followed by the deadly flooding in Pakistan.
An extreme weather event or climate disaster occurred every day, on average, somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, the World Meteorological Organization reported in 2021, and the frequency of such events increased by a factor of five over the same period.
Around the world, the economic toll of the disasters has climbed sevenfold since the 1970s, the UN agency found.

"California’s dilemma: How do you harness an epic amount of rain in a water-scarce state?

Let it flood, scientists say
California has gone from extreme drought to extreme flooding in a matter of days. On Monday, 90% of the state’s population was under a flood watch as another round of storms rolled through. Yet it was just last week when several counties in the state were experiencing the exact opposite – exceptional drought, which the US Drought Monitor considers the most severe category.
California’s parade of ultra-wet storms has not completely reversed the deeply rooted drought. And scientists warn that it has a long way to go to erase years unfavorable precipitation trends and water supply overuse.
But the abrupt shift from drought warnings to flood warnings highlights the dilemma California faces: How do you manage an overwhelming amount of rain in a water-scarce state? And is it possible to harness that water so it’s available in the dry summer months?
Part of the solution, climate scientists told CNN, is drawing levees back to allow rivers more room to flood safely into surrounding land.

“We have to let our rivers flow differently, and let the rivers flood a little more and recharge our groundwater in wet seasons,” Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and co-founder of the Pacific Institute in Oakland, told CNN. “Instead of thinking we can control all floods, we have to learn to live with them.”
Levees have effectively protected communities in the past, Gleick said, but they’re not designed for the climate-change challenges of today.
“We need new thinking, we need to operate that infrastructure differently, we need to change some of the characteristics of that infrastructure,” Gleick said. “That will allow us to capture more of these flood flows, store it underground in these aquifers, and then use those ground water resources when we need them in dry years.”
Many climate experts agree – using levees to prevent floods during the wet season means less water is available to seep into underground aquifers. Those aquifers are a vital source of water for drinking, bathing and agriculture across California’s Central Valley, and they are running dry.
But giving rivers more space to flood has a catch. It means entire communities would need to relocate; the process is known as managed retreat.
Nicholas Pinter, a researcher and professor of applied geosciences at the University of California at Davis, acknowledged managed retreat is a tall task but noted other countries are doing it.
“We are behind the curve on this,” Pinter told CNN. “The Europeans in the 1990s started doing this. They made a multi-billion-euro investment to draw levees back.”
Pinter said the US has always leaned toward building infrastructure to provide protection.
“We have always had an engineering mentality with strong property rights,” Pinter said. “There’s also an intense resistance by property owners when it comes to giving up their property rights.”
There’s also the threat of pushback from political leaders worried about property tax revenue loss and the loss of land for building and development, Pinter said.
A concept like managed retreat requires a mentality shift that will be extremely difficult to achieve, Gleick said. “These changes are absolutely easier said than done but they have to be done.”
Both Pinter and Gleick said managed retreat is just one tool in the box when it comes to adapting to more extreme weather. Gleick noted there are a litany of other policies states should consider.
“We have to redesign insurance policies so that we are not rebuilding houses once they’ve been damaged in the same places where they are going to flood again, Gleick said. “We have to design flood insurance policies to encourage people to move away from flood plains, so we can open up those floodplains, so when we get those floods they will be less damaging.”Top photo caption: A home is flooded in Gilroy, California, on Monday, January 9.

‘A world rapidly warming’: The past eight years were the eight warmest on record for planet,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/world/eight-warmest-years-climate-copernicus-intl/index.html,"‘A world rapidly warming’: The past eight years were the eight warmest on record for planet
The last eight years have been the eight warmest on record as the growing concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere pushes global temperatures toward a dangerous tipping point, a new report shows.
An analysis by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service published on Tuesday said that 2022 was the fifth-warmest year for the planet since records began. It also reported Europe recorded its warmest summer last year and its second warmest year overall, exceeded only by 2020.
Copernicus described 2022 as “a year of climate extremes” that brought record-breaking heatwaves in Europe, deadly floods in Pakistan, extreme widespread flooding in Australia, and that saw the Antarctic Sea reach its lowest minimum extent on record.
The report said that annual average temperature reached 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, marking the eighth year in a row of temperatures at least 1 degree above the 1850 to 1900 reference period.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, most countries agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees.
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified the 1.5-degree mark as a key threshold and said breaching it would dramatically increase the risk of extreme weather events and irreversible changes.
Svitlana Krakovska, who heads the Ukrainian delegation to the IPCC, has an analogy for anyone wondering what difference a few degrees of warming could make.
“Your normal body temperature is 36.6. Now we have plus [1.2] degrees and we are already sick. And if we will have 1.5, or 2, look at the difference. We cannot allow this,” she told CNN at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt in November. “Every bit of warming matters,” she said.
The Copernicus report also highlighted the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 and methane, potent greenhouse gasses that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet.

Before humans started to burn large quantities of fossil fuels, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was around 280 parts per million. According to Copernicus, it hit an annual average of 417 parts per million in 2022, an increase of 2.1 parts per million compared to 2021. Records show the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere has not been this high in around 2 million years, Copernicus added.
The IPCC has said that the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Scientists say the link between the greenhouse gasses concentrations and the rising temperatures is unmistakable.
“The tumbling of temperature records combined with the unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and intense rainfall and flooding events across the planet, along with the sustained global warmth over the past decade, are all entirely consistent with a world rapidly warming,” Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading, told CNN in an email. Allan said this is happening because of “the additional heating effect of the greenhouse gases we’re collectively pumping out into the atmosphere.”
Scientists said 2022 was an exceptionally warm year despite the La Niña phenomenon, which has now been observed for three consecutive years and which normally leads to cooler global average temperatures.
“It is very likely that the recent La Niñas have been masking some of the warming from global climate change,” said Marybeth Arcodia, a postdoctoral researcher at Colorado State University. She added that because El Niño – the opposite phase of La Niña – tends to cause higher than average temperatures, it is “probable that when the next El Niño occurs, the global average temperature will be higher than what we have been seeing in the past few years.”
Extreme heat in Europe
The Copernicus report comes just days after the UK Met Office announced that 2022 was the UK’s hottest year on record, with an average temperature of over 10 degrees Celsius recorded for the first time.
In a report released last week, the Met Office said that human-induced climate change has made the record-breaking annual temperature around 160 times more likely. Its scientists calculated that what would normally be around “one in 500 year annual temperature” is now likely every three to four years because of climate change.
Météo-France, the French national meteorological service, said Friday that 2022 was the hottest year in mainland France since records began in 1900, adding that eight of the warmest 10 years on record occurred since 2010.
It said the extreme heat France experienced in 2022 was a “clear sign of climate change” and that similar temperatures could become the norm by mid-century.
Italy’s Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences said 2022 was the hottest year on record for Italy, while the German National Meteorological Service said 2022 was “at least” tied for the hottest year on record with 2018, and could surpass 2018 once final data is analyzed this month.

"The ozone layer is on track to recover within decades as harmful chemicals are phased out, scientists report",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/world/ozone-layer-recovery-climate-intl/index.html,"The ozone layer is on track to recover within decades as harmful chemicals are phased out, scientists report
In rare good news for the planet, Earth’s ozone layer is on track to recover completely within decades, as ozone-depleting chemicals are phased out across the world, according to a new United Nations-backed assessment.
The ozone layer protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays. But since the late 1980s, scientists have sounded the alarm about a hole in this shield, caused by ozone-depleting substances including chlorofluorocarbons, dubbed CFCs, often found in refrigerators, aerosols and solvents.
International cooperation helped stem the damage. The use of CFCs has decreased 99% since the Montreal Protocol went into force in 1989, which began the phase-out of those and other ozone-harming chemicals, according to the assessment by a panel of experts published on Monday.
If global policies stay in place, the ozone layer is expected to recover to 1980 levels by 2040 for most of the world, the assessment found. For polar areas, the timeframe for recovery is longer: 2045 over the Arctic and 2066 over the Antarctic.
“Ozone action sets a precedent for climate action. Our success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done – as a matter of urgency – to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase,” said Secretary General for the World Meteorological Organization Petteri Taalas.
Ozone-depleting gases are also potent greenhouse gases, and without a ban the world could have seen additional warming of up to 1 degree Celsius, according to a 2021 study in the journal Nature. The planet has already warmed around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution, and scientists have warned that it should be limited to 1.5 degrees to prevent the worst consequences of the climate crisis. Warming beyond 1.5 degrees would dramatically increase the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages, scientists have reported.
For the first time in this assessment, which is published every four years, scientists also looked at the prospect of solar geoengineering: the attempt to reduce global warming through measures such as spraying aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight out of the earth’s atmosphere.
They found stratospheric aerosol injection could help reduce climate warming but warned there may be unintended consequences. Deploying the technology “could also affect stratospheric temperatures, circulation and ozone production and destruction rates and transport,” the report, published every four years, found."

Glaciers are set to lose substantially more ice and contribute more to sea level rise than current scientific estimates project, according to a new report. Using new satellite data to model different climate change scenarios, researchers found that up to half of glaciers could be lost by the end of the century, even if the world’s ambitious global climate targets are met.
More than 215,000 glaciers creep and slide over the world’s mountains, growing when the snow falls and shrinking when the temperature rises. They provide fresh water for nearly 2 billion people and are a key contributor to sea level rise, a threat to the billions of people living along the world’s coastlines.
While it has long been known that these giant ice “rivers,” some of which are hundreds of thousands of years old, are hugely vulnerable to the climate crisis, understanding how glaciers will react to different climate scenarios has been a challenge. Data are often regional or otherwise limited in scope, said David Rounce, a glaciologist at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the report, which was published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The past few years, however, have seen “a revolution in using satellite images to monitor glacier changes,” Rounce said, allowing scientists to come up with estimations for each individual glacier.
“That’s really a huge advance compared to previous studies,” he said.
Using these new data sets, the researchers made predictions for the fate by the end of the century of the world’s more than 215,000-plus mountain glaciers (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets) under a range of temperature increases: 1.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius.
Their modeling projects that glaciers will lose 41% of their mass by the end of the century, compared to 2015, if temperature rises hit 4 degrees Celsius.
Even if temperature rises are kept within 1.5 degrees Celsius – a target the world is not currently on track to meet – glaciers are still projected to lose 26% of their mass by the end of the century. Under a best case climate scenario, up to half the world’s glaciers could disappear by 2100, according to the report.
Current climate pledges are projected to result in global temperature rise between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100, according to the United Nations. If that happens, glaciers could almost completely disappear in several regions including central Europe, western Canada and United States, and New Zealand, the report says.
“The loss of these glaciers, especially over time horizons that are within our lifetime or our children’s lifetime, is really disturbing,” Rounce said.
Shrinking glaciers will also have a clear impact on sea level rise. The researchers project that a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in warming would see 90 millimeters (3.5 inches) of sea level rise, compared to 154 millimeters (6 inches) under a 4-degree Celsius rise.
But while significant glacier loss is locked in, every effort to tackle climate change will help reduce further losses, Rounce said. “Even a small reduction in temperature change can have a really big impact.”"
5 ways you can help those facing homelessness in the cold,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/20/us/ways-to-help-those-facing-homelessness-in-the-cold-iyw-trnd/index.html,"5 ways you can help those facing homelessness in the cold
Winter weather is in full swing, but for those who call city streets home, heading inside is not always an option.
Instead of walking by, here are a few ways you can help:
Locate a shelter or warming center
From your smartphone you can connect someone desiring shelter with support. The Salvation Army claims to have a presence in nearly every zip code across the country. And every location can serve as a warming station.
The organization is tailoring responses to fit the unique needs of each of its communities — including areas caught up in the current cold snap. People can locate their nearest Salvation Army center through the organization’s online location finder.
“The Salvation Army is involved coast to coast in dealing with the challenges of these extraordinarily cold days,” the Salvation Army’s national commander, Kenneth Hodder tells CNN.
He points out that a roof over one’s head doesn’t necessarily mean heat in one’s home. Millions of financially squeezed Americans are forced to prioritize paying for housing over utilities or food.
For these individuals, Hodder recommends placing a call to 1-800-SAL-ARMY to connect with helpful resources.
“If they do not have enough heat, if they are stranded as a traveler, if they find their children don’t have enough blankets … we’ll get to them and we will provide what help they need.”
In addition to Salvation Army resources, shelters are also accessible through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s shelter finder here. The site also provides directions to food pantries and health clinics.
Make warm meals, donate rides, call 211
On cold days, a hot homemade meal can go a long way. So consider making meals and delivering them to those living outdoors.
Mei Cobb, of the United Way, has seen volunteers make hot meals in group kitchens and distribute them in places where people experiencing homelessness often gather.
“Some are actually putting together a meal that can be heated,” Cobb tells CNN.
In 2018, The United Way launched its Ride United Last Mile delivery program in partnership with Lyft and Doordash. Donations toward this initiative help bridge a transportation gap between food pantries and vulnerable populations.
The United Way also says many of its local partners are accepting winter coat donations. By donating a gently used coat though a local United Way chapter, someone living outdoors may have better protection against frigid temperatures. To maximize efforts, at-home volunteers can organize a clothing drive among family and friends, with support of a local United Way chapter.
“To really address issues, people can get engaged as a volunteer. They can give their time, their talent and so many United Ways are doing a variety of programs whether it’s putting together clothing, making sure folks have a warm winter coat, a scarf, and mittens, or boots … even hand warmers.” Cobb says.
“They can contact the local United Way or contact a shelter or a program in their community,” she explains to CNN.
The United Way also encourages those who want to help to use the 211, non-emergency hotline, which serves as a connection point for referral services and resources in one’s own community. The United Way recommends directing individuals to this hotline number for timely, direct relief.
“It will share with you resources in your community for whatever the need may be —whether its homelessness now or any issues you maybe faced with.” Cobb explains.
Create hygiene kits from home
Another way to support those facing homelessness is by providing local shelters with hygiene and care kits. The Bowery Mission in New York City put together a comprehensive list of needed items to support their work. The list includes travel-size shampoo bottles, deodorant, non-alcoholic mouth wash, and other essential hygiene goods. Loose items can be placed in a backpack for easier transport to kit recipients. To personalize kits, consider leaving a homemade note of encouragement for added emotional wellness.
Volunteer digitally
Texas-based non-profit Our Calling empowers everyone to digitally volunteer with one swipe on a smartphone. The organization features a public app that serves two purposes: helping those in need find nearby shelters and enabling users to facilitate the distribution of aid to those dwelling in street encampments.
Our Calling says its app works nationwide, sending local findings to the right city’s homelessness response team. The app features over 100,000 agencies across the country. The software also allows users to submit services not yet included in the app’s data base.
Donate money
Every organization featured in this piece made clear that financial donations are always needed. It is a powerful way people can help from miles away and make lasting impacts that meet needs both now and later, when things thaw out.

‘Uncharted territory’: January heat records smashed across Europe,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/europe/europe-heat-records-climate-intl/index.html,"‘Uncharted territory’: January heat records smashed across Europe
The year has only just started but already Europe has broken an alarming number of weather records as extreme heat spread across the continent.
On New Year’s Day, at least eight European countries recorded their warmest January day ever: Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, Belarus, Lithuania, Denmark and Latvia, according to the climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe.
It’s “the most extreme heat wave in European history,” Herrera told CNN, based on how far above normal temperatures rose.
Cities that would often be covered in snow instead saw temperatures spike to levels usually seen in summer. “The real ‘monster’ part of this warm spell was December 31 to January 1,” Herrera told CNN.
On January 1, Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, recorded a peak of 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit), the Czech town of Javornik reached 19.6 degrees Celsius (67.3 Fahrenheit), and Jodłownik, a village in Poland, recorded a peak of 19 degrees Celsius (66.2 Fahrenheit).
Ukraine also recorded its highest temperature in January outside of Crimea.
We just observed the warmest January day on record for many countries in Europe.Truly unprecedented in modern records. pic.twitter.com/bUux1XOBH9
When you consider how far above normal temperatures climbed, the current weather event is even more extreme than the heat waves that scorched much of Europe last summer, said Herrera. And not only is the heat unusually intense, it also spans a large area, from Europe’s borders with Asia to northern Spain.
“For the first time, a heat wave in Europe can rival the most intense ever recorded in North America,” said Herrera.
The driving force behind the exceptional heat was a warm air mass from the west coast of Africa, which moved across Europe, bringing unseasonably warm conditions, according to the UK Met Office.
While meteorologists say it’s too early to confidently attribute this extreme heat to climate change, scientists have warned that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense.
“The increases in average global temperatures caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels make it more likely that temperature records will be broken,” said Rebecca Oakes, a climate scientist at the Met Office.
The record-breaking temperatures have alarmed meteorologists, but they have also had the effect of helping to ease the energy crisis that has gripped the continent.
Natural gas prices in Europe soared since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as President Vladimir Putin restricted supply to the continent, and many countries reduced their imports from Russia. But this unprecedented wave of warm weather has meant a lower demand for gas, contributing to natural gas prices slumping to their lowest level since Russia launched its invasion in February last year, according to data from Refinitiv.
In Ukraine, the unseasonably warm weather has also helped.
“Due to warm weather, [energy] consumption in Ukraine is reduced,” the country’s state-owned electricity operator Ukrenergo announced Tuesday. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian government, tweeted on New Year’s Day: “Putin wanted to freeze Ukrainian allies and defeat Ukraine. Instead, even the weather is on our side.”
But while the warm weather may provide some relief, meteorologists warn this spell offers a glimpse of a concerning future.
Europe has entered “uncharted territory,” said Herrera. “It is one thing to beat even a century old record by few decimals, it is another one to shatter about 5,000 records in two days, in some cases with margin of more than 5 degrees Celsius.”"
What will the weather be like on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/weather/new-years-weekend-weather-forecast/index.html,"What will the weather be like on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day?
The year 2022 is finally coming to a close – but not before some rainy weather arrives on both the West and East coasts.
Here’s what you can expect from the weather on the last day of 2022 and the first day of 2023.
The East Coast will have a rainy New Year’s Eve
Americans along the East Coast, from Maine to Florida, will likely have a damp New Year’s Eve, with intermittent showers throughout the day. Heavier rain is forecast further south in Georgia and Florida than in New England.
In New york City, the heaviest rainfall is expected between 7 p.m. Saturday and 1 a.m. Sunday. Temperatures will hover around 50 through most of the afternoon into Sunday.
In Buffalo, New York, where a historic blizzard left 39 people dead, rain is also expected. The rain and melting snow have also sparked flood concerns. Additional rain in the area is expected early next week.
Luckily, the rainy weather likely won’t continue onto New Year’s Day. Sunday is forecast to be cloudy but not as rainy as Saturday. New Year’s morning might see record high minimum temperatures from Washington D.C. into Boston and over the southwest, according to a Friday update from the National Weather Service.
Heavy rain and ‘shallow’ landslides will hit Northern California
Just like New Yorkers, Californians can also anticipate a rainy New Year’s Eve. A strong storm will begin bringing widespread heavy rain to the West Coast Friday through Saturday, creating a flood threat for much of Northern and Central California.
Over the holiday weekend, Californians will also witness an “atmospheric river,” a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. This heavy rainfall will slide southward to Southern California on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, accompanied by gusty winds moving at 30 to 50 mph.
“We now expect shallow landslides to be likely with the heavy rain coming New Year’s Eve,” said the National Weather Service office in San Francisco.
A flood watch for more than 16 million California residents, including the entire Bay Area and Central Valley, is in effect though Saturday night. The flooding is most likely in rivers, creeks, streams and other flood-prone areas, according to the National Weather Service office in Sacramento. Rain could ease Saturday evening before the calendar turns to 2023.
Widespread rainfall accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are expected in Northern and Central California, but locally higher amounts of 5 to 7 inches are also possible for the foothills.
Northern California and the Central California coast have already received 2 to 4 inches of rain in the last week. The cumulative effect of multiple Pacific storm systems laden with moisture from a potent atmospheric river will make impacts such as flash floods and landslides more likely.
Southern California is also expecting strong wind gusts of 30 to 50 mph on New Year’s Day in addition to rain.
Heavy snow will fall in the mountains
Whereas the coasts will see a rainy New Year’s Eve, the western mountains from the Sierra Nevada to the Rockies can count on snow for the new year. The snow follows several days of heavy and dangerous snowfall.
An eastbound stretch of Interstate-70 in Colorado reopened Thursday after a nine-hour closure left drivers stranded amid bouts of heavy mountain snow, widespread rain and gusty winds.
Severe weather that caused trees to fall on passing vehicles left five people dead in Oregon on Tuesday, including a 4-year-old girl, state police said.
Wind gusts in the state exceeded 100 mph in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.

Another significant storm system will plow into the West Coast on Friday, bringing heavy rain, mountain snow and strong winds – and the last day of the year will be a wet one in the Northeast and the Southwest.
The system that left thousands without power in Oregon and closed an interstate in Colorado will sweep through the East on Friday and Saturday. Thunderstorms will hit the South on Friday and then reach the Northeast as rain showers Saturday.
LATEST WEATHER UPDATES
That means New Year’s Eve celebrations Saturday will likely be dampened in New York City and Washington, DC. Los Angeles, too, is expected to ring in a soggy new year.
A strong storm will begin bringing widespread heavy rain Friday through Saturday, creating a flood threat for much of Northern and Central California. An active jet stream pattern will continue to bring a parade of storms fueled by an atmospheric river of Pacific moisture.
An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. This heavy rainfall will slide southward to Southern California on Saturday and Sunday, accompanied by gusty winds of 30 to 50 mph.

Southern California is also expecting strong wind gusts of 30 to 50 mph on Sunday in addition to rain.
Rain will also fall in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday, adding to the melting snow and prompting localized flood concerns as the city continues to recover from its deadly blizzard. Additional rain is expected early next week.
Rain chances for New York City will increase through Saturday, with the heaviest rainfall expected between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. Sunday. Temperatures will be near 50 through most of the afternoon into Sunday.
Most of the middle of the US should stay dry for the holiday weekend.
The eastern two-thirds of the country will be mild, with temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above normal.
Heavy snow will spread through the Mountain West from the Sierra Nevada to the Rockies.
‘Shallow’ landslides expected in Northern California
Widespread rainfall accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are expected in northern and central California, but locally higher amounts of 5 to 7 inches are also possible for the foothills.
Northern California and the central California coast have already received 2 to 4 inches of rain in the last week. The cumulative effect of multiple Pacific storm systems laden with moisture from a potent atmospheric river will make impacts such as flash floods and landslides more likely.
“We now expect shallow landslides to be likely with the heavy rain coming New Year’s Eve,” the National Weather Service office in San Francisco said.
There is a slight threat of excessive rainfall (level 2 of 4) along the Northern California coast, according to the Weather Prediction Center, including the Bay Area on Friday. It extends southward along the coast to the Los Angeles area on Saturday. The foothills of the Sierra Nevada are also under a level 2 threat of excessive rainfall Friday and Saturday.
“Moderate to heavy rainfall may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and flood-prone areas,” the weather service office in Sacramento said.
“The slight risk area mostly highlights places that are already high in soil moisture, burn scars and urban areas,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Heavy snow to spread in mountains
Forecasts also call for heavy snow to be spread through the western mountains, from the Sierra Nevada to the Rockies.
An eastbound stretch of Interstate-70 in Colorado reopened Thursday after a nine-hour closure left drivers stranded amid bouts of heavy mountain snow, widespread rain and gusty winds.
Dangerous conditions Tuesday in Oregon left five people dead, including a 4-year-old girl, after severe weather caused trees to fall on passing vehicles, state police said.

A strong storm system bringing heavy rain, mountain snow and hurricane-force wind gusts to much of the drought-parched western United States has left more than 60,000 customers without power as the region braces for more wet, blustery weather in coming days.
Eight Western states are under winter weather alerts as of 3 p.m. PT (6 p.m. ET) Wednesday. Oregon accounts for about 70% of the electricity outages, followed by Washington and California, according to PowerOutage.us.
The region is being inundated by an atmospheric river – a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can carry moisture thousands of miles – as much of the eastern US recovers from a deadly winter storm that left wide swaths of the country under dangerously cold temperatures.
In the West, an initial round of lashing rain, wind and snow has moved inland and is set to engulf inter-mountain areas Wednesday. While coastal states may experience a brief lull, more rounds of rain and snow are predicted to sweep onshore at the end of the week.
Winds on Tuesday whipped above 100 mph in some cities, reaching Category 2 hurricane levels. A gust of 107 mph was reported in Mount Hood, Oregon, and a 104-mph gust was recorded in North Bonneville, Washington. Wind speeds between 80 and 90 mph were reported Tuesday in several cities, including a gust of 90 mph in Walker, California.
“This unsettled weather pattern is expected to linger into the upcoming weekend as well,” the National Weather Center said.
More waves of rain and snow expected
Several more rounds of moisture will inundate the West this week, bringing temporary relief to a region suffering under prolonged drought conditions.
California’s snowpack could benefit from the storms. The critical source of water that has suffered under severe drought was running more than 150% of normal levels late last week, according to the California Department of Water Resources.
Now, widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are expected across the region through Sunday, with isolated areas receiving up to 6 inches. Northern California could see rainfall up to 7 inches, with isolated higher amounts.
The first wave affected parts of Southern California and the Four Corners region, including parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. Low elevation rainfall and high elevation snowfall moved out of California by late Wednesday morning and is expected to remain in the Four Corners area until Thursday.

Devastating disasters and flickers of hope: These are the top climate and weather stories of 2022,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/world/top-climate-weather-stories-2022/index.html,"Devastating disasters and flickers of hope: These are the top climate and weather stories of 2022
From a small island in Polynesia to the white-sand beaches of Florida, the planet experienced a dizzying number of climate and extreme weather disasters in 2022.

Scientists say overfishing is not the causeUS officials announce nuclear fusion breakthroughThis 100% solar community endured Hurricane Ian with no loss of power and minimal damage
Blistering summer heat broke records in drought-stricken China, threatening lives and food production. In the United States, drought and sea level rise clashed at the mouth of the historically low Mississippi River. And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.
Yet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:
Scientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.
And at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.
“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”
Here are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.
10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami
When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.
The underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.
At the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.
But months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.
9. Rivers hit record lows
Searing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.
Northern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.
Also fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.
Meanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.
8. US passes landmark climate law
After more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.
Biden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.
An analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.
7. Hurricane Nicole
Hurricane Nicole was the first hurricane to hit anywhere in the US during the month of November in nearly 40 years. The rare, late-season storm also marked the first time that a hurricane made landfall on Florida’s east coast in November.
Although Nicole was only a category 1, it had a massive wind field that stretched more than 500 miles, coupled with astronomically high tides that led to catastrophic storm surge. Homes and buildings collapsed into the ocean in Volusia County, with authorities scrambling to issue evacuation warnings.
Hurricane Nicole flooded streets, destroyed power lines and killed at least five people. The storm came just 42 days after deadly category 4 Hurricane Ian wreaked havoc on the west coast of Florida.
6. A breakthrough at COP27
Negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed at the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to set up a new fund for “loss and damage,” meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters. It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.
“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.
5. A summer of flooding
The summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.
The year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.
Deadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.
California’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.
Meanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.
4. Europe’s deadly heat wave
Europe experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.
The UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”
Throughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”
3. The West’s water crisis
The past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.
The water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.
The federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.
2. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan
Floods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.
UN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.
Pakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.
1. Hurricane Ian
Hurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.
The storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.
Hurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning. It will likely be one of the costliest hurricanes on record not only in Florida, but in the US."
"Heavy rain and snow, strong winds hitting the West this week",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/weather/california-rain-west-coast-weather/index.html,"Heavy rain and snow, strong winds hitting the West this week
Heavy coastal rain and mountain snow from a potent atmospheric river are falling across the western United States, with more to come later this week.
All 11 Western states are expecting rain or snow, with the heaviest impacts predicted for California. By Tuesday evening, the rain, snow and wind had knocked out power to about 140,000 customers in Oregon, 18,000 in California, and 31,000 in Washington state, according to poweroutage.us.
The atmospheric river – a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles – is the reason flood watches were issued for more than 5.3 million people across much of the West Coast, including Seattle.
“A series of Pacific storm systems will affect the western US with heavy rain, mountain snow and strong winds into the weekend,” the National Weather Service said.
High-wind warnings for Pacific Northwest
More than 14.9 million people in the West are under wind alerts from the National Weather Service as of Tuesday evening as the storm system pushes inland.
A high-wind warning is in effect for much of the Pacific Northwest. The Seattle office of the weather service tweeted about 5 p.m. PT that there was a gust to 63 mph in Grays Harbor County. The Portland office said at 5:24 p.m. that “west wind finally made it to the Central Gorge and Upper Hood River Valley earlier today.”
In addition, wind advisories are also posted both in the Pacific Northwest as well as many other Western states.
Some of the top wind gusts included 90 mph in Walker, California; 84 mph in Cambridge, Idaho; and 82 mph in Wagontire, Oregon.
Strong winds in Portland could knock down trees that have been weakened by weather extremes in recent years, arborist Colin Bourgeois told CNN affiliate KATU.
“The consecutive dry summers that we’ve had, especially the heat events like the heat dome, that really damages trees and it takes up so much of their energy to fuel their immune systems to fight off pathogens,” Bourgeois said.
Portland breaks a rainfall record
Areas to the west of Portland have seen up to 6 inches of precipitation in the past 24 hours, and the city on Monday broke a record for the date.
Portland recorded 2.12 inches of rain, topping the record of 1.08 inches set on December 26, 1996. Monday was the third-rainiest December day on record in Portland.
Over the next five days, rainfall across much of the West is forecast to be between 2-4 inches with isolated pockets up to 6 inches. Along the coast, rainfall is forecast to be between 4-6 inches with isolated areas potentially seeing higher.
Heavy rains could bring flash floods
The greatest flash-flooding concerns are for the western foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, as well as the coastal portions of southern Oregon down through the Bay Area and to Los Angeles County.
Widely scattered instances of flash flooding are possible at lower elevations, particularly in burn scars from wildland fires.
Moderate to heavy rain has been falling across portions of the Bay Area since Monday night and is expected to keep falling for several days.
As of mid-morning Tuesday, downtown San Francisco had recorded 1.21 inches of rain, Santa Rosa 2.72 inches and Mount Tamalpais 4.10 inches.
Law enforcement had reports of roadway flooding, so the National Weather Service office issued a flood advisory, which was canceled a few hours later.
The storm will bring a temperature drop of 15-20 degrees to Southern California.
“Say goodbye to the warmth,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles tweeted Monday. “Big drop in temperatures on track between today and tomorrow (Tuesday). Expect 15-20 degrees of cooling thanks to the approaching storm system.”
Temperatures could get as low as 49 on Wednesday night in Los Angeles, the weather service predicted.
The weather service office in Northern California also warned of rough ocean conditions.
“Seas have built to between 16 and 22 feet along the Northwest California coast,” the office in Eureka said on Twitter. “This is causing dangerous marine conditions, but also bringing large surf to the coastline. Please stay far back from the surf and off of rocks/jetties.”
Weather system could help California snowpack
In terms of snowfall, winter storm alerts have been issued for 11 Western states.
Over the next five days, lower elevation areas could see between 2-10 inches of snowfall with isolated areas getting 12-24 inches.
Snowfall in higher elevations could be between 1-3 feet with isolated areas seeing over 3 feet.
California is off to a fast start with snowpack, a critical source of water and good news for some improvement in drought conditions. As of late last week, the state’s snowpack was running more than 150% of normal, according to the California Department of Water Resources.

It’s freezing. Cranking up the heat is going to cost you
The “once-in-a-generation” winter storm sweeping across the nation will force Americans to crank up the heat at a time when it’s become increasingly expensive to do that.
Even before this historic winter storm emerged, experts warned home heating costs would jump this winter to the highest level in more than a decade.
The average cost of home heating is projected to jump increase by 17.2% from last winter to $1,208, according to a November report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.
The cost to heat homes is expected to be 35.7% higher this winter than the 2020-2021 winter, the report said.
More than 100 million people across the United States are under winter weather and wind chill alerts. The National Weather Service is describing it as a “once-in-a-generation type event.”
The spike comes as prices for natural gas – the most popular way to heat homes in America – have surged. Electricity prices have also climbed sharply.
Homes that rely on natural gas for heat will spend an average of 25% more this winter, the US Energy Information Administration projected last month. Those that use heating oil are projected to spend 45% more than last winter, while electricity will be up 11% and propane 1%.
But the heating bills will only get more expensive if the winter proves to be colder than expected.
For instance, the EIA warned the average household that uses natural gas for heat will spend 37% more than last winter if temperatures are 10% colder than forecast. Heating oil bills would spike by 52%.
Consumers were feeling sticker shock even before the winter began. Prices for utility gas spiked 15.5% year-over-year in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Electricity prices were up 14%.
The financial pain is particularly acute for those who can least afford swings in their expense.
“Home heating costs are becoming increasingly unaffordable for millions of lower income families,” NEADA said in the November report.
As of August, about one in six US families were behind on their utility bills, translating to approximately 20 million households, according to NEADA.
New England is especially vulnerable to severe winter weather, in large part because of constraints on pipelines sending natural gas into the region.
Wholesale power prices in New England are expected to jump by 35% in January from the year before, the EIA said.

Stay safe and warm with this winter weather guide,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/health/cold-weather-safety-advice-wellness/index.html,"How to stay safe and healthy during extreme cold this winter season
Follow:
Winter storms can derail our daily schedules and travel plans — but extreme cold, freezing rain, wind and snow can also affect our health.
In recent years, death rates in the United States have been 8% to 12% higher during winter months, according to mortality data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, more than 19,000 Americans have died specifically from cold-related causes since 1979, according to death certificates.
This increase is linked to “seasonal changes in behavior and the human body” and “increased exposure to respiratory diseases,” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
On top of preparing your home and car for winter weather, there are steps you can take to keep yourself and others healthy when it’s very cold.
Caring for children and the elderly
Infants and older adults should be top of mind during a winter storm, says Dr. Tyler Barrett, executive medical director of emergency services at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville.
Who will see snow this weekend? First big winter storm of the season targets Northeast and mid-Atlantic
“Infants and older adults have a harder time maintaining their core body temperatures,” he said, because babies lose body heat more easily and older adults tend to make less body heat. Hypothermia happens when your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced.
Make sure any children younger than 1 are sleeping in warm rooms, ideally between 68 and 72 degrees. Similarly, if you have friends or neighbors older than 65, check on them frequently to ensure that their homes are adequately heated.
Barrett also notes the risk for hypothermia goes up once the temperature inside a home goes below 50 degrees for a prolonged period of time.
Try to keep pets indoors during cold weather, but if they go outside, thoroughly wipe their legs and underbelly free of snow when they come in.
Staying safe indoors
What you should have in stock when preparing for a winter storm
Never use generators, gas or charcoal grills or wood stove inside your home. The fumes from these devices can cause carbon monoxide to build up, Barrett adds, and the odorless and colorless gas can kill you.
“If you are running any sort of heater, always be cognizant of carbon monoxide and have a carbon monoxide detector in your house,” he said.
Using the kitchen stove for heat is also not safe, the CDC warns; instead, use extra blankets, sleeping bags or coats. A well-maintained fireplace or a portable space heater may be a safer alternative.
Staying safe outdoors
Avoid traveling on ice-covered roads if possible. If you’re stranded outdoors and have a vehicle, it’s safest to stay inside it to prevent hypothermia, the National Weather Service says.
If you have to shovel snow or do other outdoor work, take your time and work slowly. Avoid walking on ice and getting wet.
Travel in pairs and keep an emergency kit nearby, as well as a cell phone, when you’re participating in outdoor recreation like skiing, sledding, or going for a run.
Dangers of frostbite and hypothermia
If you need to venture out during a winter storm, Barrett recommends limiting the amount of time you spend outside to prevent frostbite or hypothermia.
Frostbite can strike quickly. Here’s what you need to know
“Dress in warm, dry layers with a special emphasis on protecting those more sensitive areas like your ears, your nose, your cheeks, your toes, your fingers,” he said. “Those are the areas that are at increased risk of developing frostbite.”
Frostbite can happen in freezing temperatures when your blood vessels narrow, skin temperature drops and ice crystals form around and within your cells, causing damage. Symptoms include white or grayish-yellow skin that feels unusually firm and numbness in the affected area.
If you or someone you know develops frostbite and immediate medical care is not available, the CDC recommends getting into a warm room as soon as possible and immersing the affected area in warm — not hot — water. You can also warm the affected area using body heat.
Hypothermia is a more serious medical condition that requires emergency medical assistance, the CDC says. Someone with hypothermia may be shivering excessively or have skin that is bright red and cold. Other signs include confusion, memory loss, slurred speech and drowsiness.
If you can’t get to a hospital right away, find a warm room or shelter and remove any wet clothing.
Warm the center of the body first – chest, neck and head – with skin-to-skin contact under loose, dry layers. Warm beverages can also help increase body temperature.
Staying moisturized
In extremely cold temperatures, our skin can become very dry and cracked if not moisturized properly.
The Northeast and mid-Atlantic are in for an icy, snowy weekend as winter storm looms
“You do have increased risk for developing skin infections,” Barrett said. “We all have bacteria that live on our skin, and your skin serves as a barrier, keeping that bacteria from infecting you, so if you do get dry cracked skin, you are at some slightly increased risk.”
Use warm water instead of hot water during baths and showers to prevent dry skin from worsening.
The American Academy of Dermatology recommends applying moisturizer immediately after you shower to trap existing moisture in your skin. An ointment or cream could be more beneficial than lotions with heavy perfumes or scents.
“People who suffer from eczema may get some increased flares during wintertime,” Barrett said, adding that those with winter-related skin conditions should talk to their primary care provider for further guidance and treatment.
Extreme cold and the lungs
Colder, drier air can cause complications for people with respiratory illnesses like the flu, Covid-19 and RSV, Barrett says, by irritating the airways and causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath.
The year’s most extreme weather shows what a warming planet is capable of, and what’s to come
Annual vaccinations are important, especially those for flu and Covid-19, to help prevent these complications. The flu shot has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%, according to the CDC.
People with lung diseases such as asthma are also at risk of complications from cold weather because of inflammation in their lungs.
“If you do have asthma and you’re going to be outside, try to limit breathing in that cold air, whether that’s wearing a scarf or just limiting your time outside,” Barrett said. People with asthma should also keep a rescue inhaler on them at all times.
If you cannot breathe due to extreme cold, whether from a respiratory illness or asthma, he advises going to the emergency room right away.
Cardiovascular risks
Frosty weather can affect your heart, especially if you have cardiovascular disease, by narrowing the blood vessels. That can put stress on your heart.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
“Snow shoveling is one example where we see people who have heart disease, or risk factors for heart disease, exerting themselves more than they may otherwise,” Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and an emergency department physician, told CNN previously.
A drop in temperature by 33 degrees Fahrenheit was associated with a cumulative 2% increased risk of heart attack in a 2010 study published in the BMJ.
People who have a heart condition or even high blood pressure should avoid strenuous activities like shoveling or exercising too much."
Arctic blast this week brings the coldest Christmas in nearly 40 years for millions,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/weather/christmas-week-forecast-cold-snow-wxn/index.html,"Arctic blast this week brings the coldest Christmas in nearly 40 years for millions
Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.
The coldest air of the season – by far – will dive down from Canada, bringing dangerously cold temperatures to millions this week. Temperatures will drop so low in some places that frostbite could begin in as little as five minutes on exposed skin.
Temperatures are already cold to start the week across much of the northern tier of the country.
“Highs over central and eastern Montana will struggle to get above zero today, while daytime lows ranging from 0 to -15 degrees will be common from eastern Washington to the Upper Mississippi Valley,” the Weather Prediction Center wrote.
But this is only the beginning of a brutal week that will get much, much colder – as temperatures dive 30 to 50 degrees below normal.
“Daytime lows on Tuesday dip as low as -20 to -30 in parts of Montana, with sub-zero lows bleeding more into the central High Plains,” the prediction center said. “Blustery winds throughout the region are responsible for bone-chilling wind chills, ranging as cold as -30 to even -60 degrees.”
This week, more than 80% of the Lower 48 will experience temperatures below freezing. Places as far south as Houston; Austin, Texas; Atlanta and even Orlando are currently included on that list. And some in the Midwest could also experience their coldest Christmas Day in nearly 40 years.
A holiday storm set to impact millions
The cold air will allow for a major winter storm to develop, bringing significant impacts to the central and eastern US which could wreck any holiday travel plans this week.
This big winter storm will take shape beginning on Tuesday, bringing heavy snow, strong winds – both of which could lead to blizzard conditions – rain, and even colder temperatures to follow.
The snow will begin across the Rockies and amplify as it approaches the Midwest, where the biggest impacts from the storm will be felt. Snow will begin for this region Thursday evening and last through much of the Christmas weekend.
Heavy snow will fall across much of the Midwest and extend as far south as the Lower Mississippi Valley – where we could see snow flurries as far south as Jackson, Mississippi.
Chicago will be one of the cities hit the hardest, as its National Weather Service office warns of the potential for a blizzard.
Blizzard conditions occur when there is falling or blowing snow combined with winds of at least 35 mph leading to reduced visibility to at least a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.
“Rapidly deteriorating conditions by late Thursday afternoon, with dangerous blizzard conditions appearing increasingly likely Thursday night into Friday,” said the weather service office in Chicago.
This will bring holiday travel to a standstill. The weather service is already urging people to make alternate plans for travel.
According to one forecast model, we could see more than a foot of snow pile up across the Midwest.

Power outages will also be a concern for the Windy City as winds could gust as high as 50 mph on Friday. This will only exacerbate the storm’s impacts as wind chills will drop to at least 20 degrees below zero, possibly even colder.
The expected high on Christmas Day in Chicago is 12. That would make it the coldest Christmas in Chicago since 1996.  A little farther south, Indianapolis has a forecast high of 13 degrees, which could be their coldest Christmas since 1985 – nearly 40 years!
The reason for the cold is a major dip in the jet stream, that’s allowing for super cold air to dive very far south.
“It’s night in the northern hemisphere Arctic regions and there’s snow and ice covering that entire area. So, you’ve basically got a source freezer sitting up there in the Arctic polar regions,” Greg Carbin, branch chief at the prediction center said. “It’s sort of the Polar Express and the cold air can hold on to those characteristics because there’s a lot of snow cover on the ground, even across the north-central United States.”
Minneapolis is expected to drop below zero on Wednesday afternoon and may not get back above zero until Saturday – a full 72 hours later.
Parts of central Minnesota could see “several inches of fluffy snow” that will continue into Wednesday night, the National Weather Service office in Twin Cities said on Facebook. By Thursday, wind gusts in the area will reach up to 40 to 50 mph.
“The bottom line is travel will be very dangerous and could be LIFE-THREATENING later this week so be prepared to alter travel plans now!” the weather service said.
Fargo, North Dakota, will drop below zero this evening and not get above zero again until Christmas Day.
Wind chill alerts stretch across much of Montana, the Dakotas, portions of Minnesota and Nebraska where wind chills could drop as low as 60 degrees below zero.
This extreme cold will dive to the Deep South as well. Places including Atlanta could experience one of their top three coldest Christmases, with the high expected to only reach 33 degrees.
Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, will also drop below freezing on Friday. Nashville will reach only 16 on Friday with 25 mph winds making it feel like 3 degrees below zero. They will hit only 26 on Christmas Day. Memphis could see its coldest Christmas since 1985 with a forecast high of 28.
Places including Little Rock, Arkansas, and Oklahoma City could also struggle to get above freezing on Christmas Day.
A bomb cyclone for the Northeast
The storm will bomb out Friday night into Saturday morning, making this a bomb cyclone before entering the Northeast and New England. A bomb cyclone is when the storm drops 24 millibars in pressure in 24 hours.
Watch: What is a bomb cyclone?
The storm will bring mainly rain to the I-95 corridor, except for maybe a brief window of some heavy, wet snow on Friday night. Much of this area will experience miserable, cold, windy rain.
“I-95 gets a slug of pretty deep rain and that can be a problem in those areas that are now seeing snow,” Carbin said. “You can see some runoff melting, maybe even some flooding.”
Heavy snow will fall inland. Starting in the Appalachians and extending all the way up into interior New England, we could see as much as 4 to 6 inches of snow, especially at the higher elevations.
And like the rest of the country, the cold air will follow.
This will be the coldest Christmas in more than 20 years for much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City and Washington, DC, will all stay in the 20s for Christmas Day.
Probability of a white Christmas
A white Christmas is less likely for many due to climate change. Read more.
This major storm is upping the chances of a white Christmas for millions across the country. Some areas were already a given, considering there was snow already on the ground and the cold temperatures keeping it there.
But a fresh coat of powder will fall this week, blanketing the entire Midwest and Northern Plains.
“Parts of Ohio, Indiana, they could very well end up with a higher probability of a white Christmas as well,” Carbin said.
We might even have a white Christmas as far south as parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
“The probability is normally about 10% that the DC area will have at least one inch of snow on Christmas Day,” Carbin explained. “With the pattern coming together the way it is, I’d be willing to bump that up to a 30% chance and it could increase pretty substantially here in the next couple of days, depending on what scenario comes out.”

More than 190 countries sign landmark agreement to halt the biodiversity crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/world/cop15-biodiversity-agreement-montreal-climate-scn-intl/index.html,"More than 190 countries sign landmark agreement to halt the biodiversity crisis
More than 190 countries have adopted a sweeping agreement to protect nature at the United Nations’ biodiversity conference in Montreal.
The gavel went down in the early hours of Monday on an agreement which includes 23 targets aimed at halting the biodiversity crisis, including a pledge to protect 30% of land and oceans by 2030. Only 17% of land and 10% of oceans are currently considered protected. Campaigners have hailed it as a “major milestone” for conserving complex, fragile ecosystems on which everyone depends.
But some countries were unhappy, criticizing the agreement for not going far enough. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has said it cannot support the agreement and has complained that it was rushed through without following proper processes.
The road to this deal has been long and littered with delays. It was originally supposed to take place in Kunming, China, but difficulties posed by the country’s zero-Covid policies made that impossible. The conference was moved to Canada under joint Canadian and Chinese leadership. Hopes were high for the conference, with some calling for it to be a “Paris moment for biodiversity” – referring to the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Nature is declining at alarming rates. In 2019, a landmark report from the UN’s expert nature panel found that up to 1 million land and marine species face extinction because of human actions. Some scientists say the world is entering the sixth mass extinction, driven by human actions including deforestation, burning fossil fuels and polluting rivers and oceans.
After two weeks of negotiations — with tensions over how to finance global conservation proving to be a particular sticking point — the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework was finally adopted at around 3:30 a.m. local time on Monday.
As well as the pledge to protect nearly one third of land, freshwater and seas by 2030, the framework also includes an agreement to reform $500 billion of subsidies that are harmful to nature, and to increase biodiversity financing to developing countries.
“The agreement represents a major milestone for the conservation of our natural world, and biodiversity has never been so high on the political and business agenda,” said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.
Brian O’Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature said: “The ’30x30’ target marks the largest land and ocean conservation commitment in history. It will have major positive impacts for wildlife, for addressing climate change, and for securing the services that nature provides to people, including clean water and pollination for crop.”
The framework also includes language to protect Indigenous people, who have an outsized role protecting the world’s biodiversity but have often been overlooked and, in some cases, even forced from the lands in the name of conservation. It “has the potential to usher in a new paradigm for conservation, one in which indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ rights are upheld and where they are recognized for the leadership they have provided,” said O’Donnell.
While many have welcomed the agreement, there are warnings that the proof of success will be in how the agreement is enacted.
“It can be undermined by slow implementation and failure to mobilize the promised resources,” said Lambertini.
The agreement has also been criticized for lacking quantifiable pledges around reducing production and consumption, which are key drivers of biodiversity loss.
The agreement is not legally binding. Countries have agreed to a monitoring framework to evaluate progress but “there are no binding commitments making the whole mechanism look weak,” Imma Oliveras Menor, senior researcher at Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford told told the Science Media Centre in London.
The history of biodiversity targets is checkered. The world failed to meet in full a single one of the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets set more than a decade ago in Japan. Some developing countries have expressed disappointment over the funding levels promised in the final deal.
Many still remain cautiously optimistic.
“The Kunming-Montreal Agreement adopted today gives nature a fighting chance at recovery in a world currently divided by geopolitics and inequality,” said Lin Li, senior director of global policy and advocacy at WWF International.
The next biodiversity summit will take place in 2024 and is expected to see countries strengthen financial commitments towards halting biodiversity loss."
Get ready for a ‘polar plunge.’ The first week of winter brings snow and bitterly cold temperatures,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/weather/weather-cold-air-eastern-us-winter/index.html,"Get ready for a ‘polar plunge.’ The first week of winter brings snow and bitterly cold temperatures
Astronomical winter officially begins this Wednesday and Jack Frost will arrive in full force.
Temperatures will take a polar plunge this week, and even Florida won’t be spared, thanks to a strong high-pressure system sliding south from Canada.
“Very cold Arctic air masses will envelop much of the central and eastern half of the nation during the two week period, including the busy holiday travel season,” the Climate Prediction Center said.
From Idaho to Minnesota, temperatures will range between 10 to 30 degrees below average starting Sunday. By Tuesday, that bitter cold will spread from Washington to Wisconsin and down through Texas, and will become more extreme, with some areas reaching 45 degrees below normal.
“Highs will only reach into the single digits throughout the northern Plains, while lows fall into subzero territory and minus teens closer to the Canadian border,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Gusty winds will make it feel even colder throughout northern Montana, where wind chill advisories are in effect due to the potential for wind chills to dip as low as 30 to 45 degrees below zero.”
At those temperatures, hypothermia can start in less than 10 minutes – but it could be as little as 5 minutes for areas of South Dakota.
The National Weather Service office in Rapid City, South Dakota, noted that wind chills as low as 50 to 60 below zero are possible on Wednesday night.
Even worse, the wind chill advisory is in effect until Thursday. Five whole days of bitterly cold temperatures to kick start the winter season, and it’s not just for Montana.
Chilly start to winter
It’s that time of year again when everyone hates Florida – the only real warm spot across the country – but only for the next few days, since Florida will also cool down by the end of the week.
On Monday, Atlanta will see a high temperature near 50 degrees, but come Friday, that high temperature may not even reach 30 degrees. Denver goes from a high of 46 degrees on Monday down to a high of only 14 by Thursday.
Some Floridians will see a much more sudden drop. Pensacola’s high temperature of 64 on Thursday will seem downright tropical compared to the high of 38 just 24 hours later. And yes, this means overnight low temperatures are likely to drop below freezing.
Make sure to cover any plants you may still have outside and bring your pets inside this week.
Even Miami’s high temperature of 73 on Friday – which will likely be the warmest spot across the continental US – will be nearly 10 degrees cooler than the previous day.
Over the next week, more than 260 million people will see temperatures at or below freezing across the US – over 80 percent of the population.
“As cold as it will likely be, it will be difficult to challenge daily record lows/cold highs due to this event overlapping with portions of the historic 1983 and 1989 cold waves. At the very least portions of the East may end up seeing the coldest temperatures for any December since 2017.”
The cold air is here to stay. Long-range forecast models continue to show temperatures well below normal through Christmas weekend.
“A major storm system is forecast to impact much of the Nation leading up to Christmas Eve, with widespread gusty winds, areas of heavy rain and heavy snow, as well as bitter cold in its wake,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Be sure to pay close attention to the forecast this week as details become certain.”
If you are looking for warm weather for the holiday weekend, you will be limited to South Florida, Southern California, or Hawaii.

Recent rain and snow brought some relief to California’s historic drought. It’s still not enough,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/us/california-december-rain-snow-drought-climate/index.html,"Recent rain and snow brought some relief to California’s historic drought. It’s still not enough
Winter in drought-stricken California is off to a fast start with a series of storms bringing a generous amount of rain and snow across Western states.
And it’s already starting to make a dent in California’s drought conditions, according to the latest US Drought Monitor released Thursday morning. The barrage of rain and snow brought a tiny glimpse of hope for drought-weary residents, who in the past three years have been facing back-to-back historically dry years that triggered unprecedented water shortages and landscape-altering wildfires.

 Lake Mead's receding waterlines have revealed unexpected discoveries
Snowpack across California, as of Wednesday, is running more than twice the normal amount and trending near record levels for December, especially in the northern part of the state. But experts say they are “cautiously optimistic” about what this means for the coming months.
Andrew Schwartz, the lead scientist and station manager of University of California, Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, says they are going to need more snow falling at the lab, which is located at Donner Pass east of Sacramento. It’s where he and other researchers measure snowpack totals and how much water equivalent would be available for the state’s residents.
“If we want to completely get rid of this drought, we need basically another year’s worth of precipitation [at the lab] – we need 60 feet of snow total and 30 extra feet of snow compared to what we would get on average,” Schwartz told CNN, noting that their average snowfall is at 30 feet and that they would need to keep up the momentum all winter long, which is very unlikely.
“The storm was fantastic, but it’s definitely not enough to end the drought,” he said.
‘A good-news storm’
High-elevation snowpack serves as a natural reservoir that eases drought, storing water through the winter months and slowly releasing it through the spring melting season. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada accounts for 30% of California’s fresh water supply in an average year, according to the California Department of Water Resources.
With the multiyear megadrought, the snowpack in the Sierras had been at alarmingly low levels, while reservoirs, which are replenished by spring snow melt, are still below the historical average.
Nevertheless, this week’s storms brought some ease to the most parched areas of the state.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, says the storm sequence the past week in the Sierra Nevada has been “honestly remarkable,” though he notes it would have been considered “unremarkable” just a few decades ago if it weren’t for the climate crisis. Over the last decade, California has trended much drier than usual, so the recent back-to-back precipitation events have been a significant change in pace.
“It was definitely a good-news storm on balance, since despite the short-term disruption, it dropped quite a bit of water in places that really need it due to long-term drought and climate change-driven aridification,” Swain told CNN. “And, importantly, it dropped that water as snow, which is accumulating over weeks and months as snowpack, rather than warm rains that immediately turn into runoff.”
Exceptional drought, the highest drought designation, was slashed nearly in half this week, covering only 7% of the state – the lowest California has seen since May. To put that into perspective, that figure was more than 28% a year ago. According to the latest update, exceptional drought continues to persist in the southern parts of the Central Valley, particularly in Kern, Kings, Fresno and Tulare counties.
While the storm did not break any long-standing records like last year’s snow, despite dropping several feet of snow in the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada, Swain says mountain snowpack is now well above-average for the calendar date and that overall precipitation is relatively near average in most places.
“In the short term, California is in pretty decent shape from a water perspective,” Swain said.
A potential dry spell ahead
Experts say it’s too early to tell how the recent storms will impact the drought, underscoring how last year’s record-breaking December snow sparked some early hope but later “flatlined” for the rest of the winter months.
“It’s like a football game – we’ve scored a touchdown in the first quarter, but there’s three quarters left before we can really determine what the game outcome is going to be,” Schwartz said. “So if we get to March or April, and we’re sitting at above-average precipitation, then we can start to relax. We can start to celebrate a little bit.”
Still, California is mired in yearslong drought and continues to face an unprecedented long-term water crisis. More than 97% of the state remains in some level of drought. And on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California declared a regional drought emergency for Southern California to prepare for the fourth consecutive dry year.
Swain says that there are already indications of a potentially prolonged multi-week dry spell in the coming weeks – right at the peak of the wet season in California and the Southwest. If dry and relatively warm conditions form over the next few weeks, he says that could substantially offset the gains that recent snow and rain brought in recent weeks.
A La Niña advisory is still in effect for the region, but according to the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), that is expected to change by spring, where a wetter pattern is forecast to come through California. In the Southwest, La Niña typically causes the jet stream – upper-level winds that carry storms around the globe – to shift northward. That means less rainfall for a region that desperately needs it.
In addition, Swain says there has been a tilt in the seasonal outlook toward drier-than-average conditions across much of California and the lower Colorado River Basin, which will see additional unprecedented water cuts in effect in the new year, for January through spring.
“That does not bode especially well for long-term drought relief, particularly on the Colorado River system, where the rapidly accelerating water crisis threatens to reach new heights in 2023 unless unexpectedly wet conditions occur over the next few months,” he said.
If anything, Schwartz said, this is the time “we need to be conserving our water more and maybe even bumping conservation efforts because this isn’t a guarantee of a full deep winter.”

"Whales can have an important but overlooked role in tackling the climate crisis, researchers say",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/world/whales-carbon-sinks-climate-change-scn/index.html,"Whales can have an important but overlooked role in tackling the climate crisis, researchers say
The world’s largest whales are more than just astonishing creatures. Much like the ocean, soil and forests, whales can help save humanity from the accelerating climate crisis by sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions, researchers say.
In a paper published Thursday in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution, climate researchers suggest that whales are important, but often overlooked, carbon sinks. The enormous size of these marine mammals, which can reach 150 tons, means they can store carbon much more effectively than smaller animals.
And because whales live longer than most animals, some for more than 100 years, the paper said they could be “one of the largest stable living carbon pools” in the ocean. Even when they die, whale carcasses descend to the deepest parts of the sea and settle on the seafloor, trapping the carbon they’ve stored in their stout, protein-rich bodies.
An indirect way whales can be critical carbon sinks is through their feces. Whale poop is rich in nutrients which can be taken up by phytoplankton — tiny organisms that suck up carbon dioxide as they grow.  When they die, phytoplankton also sink at the bottom of the seafloor, taking tiny bits of carbon in their carcasses.
The process of carbon sequestration helps mitigate climate change, because it locks away carbon that otherwise would have warmed the planet somewhere else for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.
Yet whales are threatened, with six out of 13 great whale species classified as endangered or vulnerable due to threats including industrial whaling, which has reduced whale biomass by 81%, as well as entanglement with fishing gear, climate change-induced shifts in prey availability, noise pollution and more.
Heidi Pearson, lead author and researcher at the University of Alaska Southeast, said the research shows that protecting whales has a double benefit — helping to stem the biodiversity crisis as well as human-caused climate change.
The paper puts together all available research about how whales work as critical carbon sinks. As the need grows for nature-based solutions such as tree planting to help solve the climate crisis, Pearson said it is important to understand the ability of whales to trap carbon.
“You can think of protecting whales as a low risk and low regret strategy, because there’s really no downside,” Pearson told CNN. “What if we protect them and get ecosystem benefits in addition to carbon?” She said there was no risk to this strategy compared to other untested, expensive solutions to capturing and trapping carbon, such as geoengineering. There has been much research and analysis into whales’ contribution to carbon storage over the years.
In 2019, economists with the International Monetary Fund attempted to quantify the economic benefits of whales. The first-of-its-kind analysis looked at the market price of carbon dioxide, then calculated the whale’s total monetary value based on how much carbon it captures, in addition to other economic benefits like ecotourism. It put the average value of a great whale at $2 million.
But there remain big gaps in knowledge to fully determine how whale carbon should be used in climate mitigation policies. Asha de Vos, a marine biologist and founder of Oceanswell in Sri Lanka, said it’s important to recognize that whales have “more to offer than their beauty and charisma,” and that protecting them is key to a proper functioning ocean ecosystem.
“But, as the authors suggest, we mustn’t overemphasize the role of whales in these spaces as we do not have sufficient research,” de Vos, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “Fundamentally, whales will not save our oceans or planet on their own, but they likely play a role in the larger system.”
As Pearson continues to research whale carbon in Alaska, particularly delving into the indirect pathways in which whales can be carbon sinks, she said she hopes the current paper pushes policymakers to consider whales as a significant part of climate mitigation strategies.
It’s another layer that links the biodiversity crisis to the climate crisis — but for now, Pearson said she and a team will go back out in the field to fully quantify the carbon impact of whales.
“Whales aren’t a silver bullet to saving the planet; it’s just one small thing that we could do amidst many other things we need to do for climate change,” Pearson said. “We just need to get the scientific story straight.”"
How the climate crisis may be changing the way tornadoes behave,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/climate-change-affecting-tornadoes-xpn/index.html,"How the climate crisis may be changing the way tornadoes behave
Among the cocktail of extreme weather events that plow through the United States, tornadoes can be the most destructive and the most deadly especially for those unprepared for what’s to come.
As severe weather events intensify, occur more often and exacerbate the country’s growing economic toll, science is running to keep up to answer emerging questions of whether climate change is worsening every single disaster.
But unlike heat waves, floods and hurricanes, scientific research about the connection between the climate crisis and tornadoes has not been as easy to make; though climate researchers say uncertainty doesn’t mean it is unlikely, and experts are already seeing changes in how recent tornado outbreaks are behaving.
When a series of twisters uprooted trees, tore down infrastructure and killed dozens of people in Kentucky in December 2021, for instance, meteorologists and climate scientists — careful not to attribute the cause to climate change — underscored the “historic” nature of the tornadic outbreak.
What’s clear, experts say, is that these weather events, no matter how severe, are occurring against the backdrop of human-caused climate change; it just all comes down to discerning how a warming planet is altering weather patterns, including geographical location and frequency, as well as severity.
Scientists say the short-lived scale of tornadoes, coupled with an extremely inconsistent and unreliable historical record, makes connecting outbreaks to long-term, human-caused climate change extremely tough.
Victor Gensini, a professor at Northern Illinois University and one of the top tornado experts, described the 2021 Kentucky outbreak as one of the most remarkable in US history — and while climate change may have played a part in its violent behavior, it’s not yet clear what that role was. That same sentiment can be said with the most recent devastating outbreaks.
Think of a pair of dice, he said. On one die, you altered the value of five to six, which means it now has two sixes — raising the chances of you rolling the pair of dice and getting the value 12. Although you can’t immediately attribute that value of 12 to the change you made, you just altered the probability of that event occurring.
Gensini said that’s similar to how the climate system now works — the more humans pump greenhouse gases like fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere and change the system, the chances of extreme weather events occurring, intensifying, and changing the traditional location and patterns will amplify.
“When you start putting a lot of these events together, and you start looking at them in the aggregate sense, the statistics are pretty clear that not only has there sort of been a change — a shift, if you will — of where the greatest tornado frequency is happening,” Gensini previously told CNN. “But these events are becoming perhaps stronger, more frequent and also more variable.”
Todd Moore, associate professor and chair of the department of geosciences at Fort Hays State University, said that over the last few decades tornado frequency has increased in vast swaths of the southern Midwest and Southeast, while decreasing in parts of the central and southern Great Plains, a region traditionally known as Tornado Alley.
A study he authored in 2019 indicated that the changing climate, among other factors, could be contributing to this eastward shift in Tornado Alley, resulting in more tornadoes occurring in the more heavily populated states east of the Mississippi River. Moore points to different ingredients that may have led to this shift such as humidity, instability, and a strong wind shear.
His study also found that tornadoes are “clustering on fewer days in the year” and that days with little tornado activity are becoming less common, with outbreaks becoming more frequent during the fall and winter seasons.
“Climatologists are currently trying to determine why these trends are occurring,” Moore told CNN.
Tornadoes take shape under particularly specific atmospheric conditions, but are primarily fueled by warm, moist air from strong winds that shift direction with altitude.
Scientists have warned that the rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere is drastically changing the climate system, causing the jet stream — fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day-to-day weather — to behave oddly.
“An explanation for increased concentration of tornadoes is tenuous,” Moore said. “One hypothesis is that a wavier jet stream is providing more environments favorable for tornado outbreaks, so their likelihood of occurrence is increasing.”
But the offset is that it’s also likely a tornado outbreak was simply triggered by natural forces at play, against the background of climate change.
The World Weather Attribution, a group of the world’s leading scientists that establishes the link between climate and weather, for instance, previously concluded that climate change played little to no role in intensifying the flooding that killed 138 people in Vietnam in 2020.
“It’s also very common when you have La Niña in place to see this eastward shift in highest tornado frequency,” Gensini said. “But if you look at the past 40 years, the research I’ve done … has shown that places like Nashville, Tennessee, for example, or Mayfield, Kentucky … their frequency of tornadoes, their risk of having a tornado has increased over the last 40 years.”
This is backed by a 2021 report from the World Meteorological Organization that found an extreme weather event or climate disaster has occurred every day, on average, somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, marking a five-fold increase over that period and exacting an economic toll that has climbed seven-fold since the 1970s.
As the climate crisis accelerates and further research continues to establish its connection with tornadoes, more people will be vulnerable to the most severe consequences of extreme weather events. And experts say cities shouldn’t put off adaptation plans any longer, and that they should use available climate research and treat them as part of the larger emergency response system.
Gensini said climate change or not, these types of tornado disasters will continue to worsen as humans alter the landscape and build larger, more sprawling cities.
“We have more assets and more targets for the severe storms to hit,” he said. “So even if you take climate change out of the equation, which is very likely to make the problem worse, we still have this issue of human and societal vulnerability.”"
"Hotter, rainier, wetter — climate change is dramatically transforming the Arctic, report finds",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/us/arctic-noaa-report-card-climate-change/index.html,"Hotter, rainier, wetter — climate change is dramatically transforming the Arctic, report finds
Each year, the Arctic region goes through an annual health checkup — and the results are in: From a rapid decline in snow cover to an unprecedented late season melting event to another year of seabird die-offs, the Arctic has once again shown clear symptoms of an ailing planet.
A report published Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that this vast and significant northern biome is dramatically shifting, with snow cover declining at an alarming rate of about 20% per decade. It continues to warm four times faster than the rest of Earth, with the last seven years being the warmest on record, according to the report.
Authored by more than 140 scientists around the globe, the Arctic Report Card examined the region’s “vital signs” between October 2021 and September 2022, including changes in snow cover, sea ice volume, air and ocean temperatures, as well as a new pulse-check on precipitation events.
The report describes an increase in commercial activities and vessels venturing deeper into the Arctic on sea routes opened up by melting ice. These ships increase noise pollution in the region, altering its soundscape and interfering with the ability of marine mammals to communicate.
Changes in the Arctic also threaten the lives of people living in the region, particularly Indigenous communities who have long relied on the region’s typically frozen landscape
The report “demonstrates that we are seeing many of the most intense impacts of climate change first in the Arctic,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told CNN. “I can’t overstate this but rapid warming in the Arctic is profoundly affecting more than 400,000 Indigenous people who live there, and in many instances is upending their entire way of life.”
While the Arctic might seem remote, what happens in this region is a bellwether for the global climate — and the report makes clear that its impacts are far-reaching.
A wetter Arctic
Global scientists have detected a significant increase in Arctic precipitation since the 1950s, according to the report. Of the past 72 years, this year marked the third wettest on record in the Arctic.
The NOAA report shows that the central part of the Arctic exhibited more consecutive wet days than dry ones, as well as a notable rise in heavy precipitation in the North Atlantic. September in Greenland, for instance, is typically snowy. This year, it was rainy.
The Greenland ice sheet saw two unprecedented late season melting events. The first was in early September after high pressure drove temperatures well above average early in the month, with 36% of the ice sheet showing surface melting. Then later in the month, the remnants of Hurricane Fiona, tracking north after devastating Puerto Rico and slamming into Canada’s Atlantic coast, pushed a wave of warm, moist air over the ice sheet, triggering the largest late-September melting event on the southern ice sheet.
“Setting two records in one month is always unexpected,” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), told CNN.  “It’s rare but not unheard of for a hurricane remnant to affect southern Greenland or even Iceland or the UK, but very unusual for it to have this large an impact.”
Jason Box, a climate scientist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told CNN it was “reminiscent of August 2021,” when rain fell on the summit of Greenland instead of snow for the first time on record, a phenomenon climate modeling suggests will likely be the norm in the coming decades.
Also in September, Typhoon Merbok formed in the northern Pacific, bringing hurricane-force winds and massive waves and storm surges to the Bering Sea region. Coastal and river communities, particularly Alaskan natives, faced flooding, erosion and power outages. The storm disrupted the communities’ hunting and harvesting season ahead of the winter months.
Additionally, the report shows that although the Arctic was wetter than usual, some areas such as Alaska and northeastern Siberia saw a gripping drought over the summer months, which triggered severe wildfires.
Seabirds, ships, and Indigenous peoples
The NOAA report card shows another year of seabirds dying in the Bering and Chukchi seas. Bird carcasses have been found along the coast for the sixth year in a row, researchers say.
Before 2015, seabird die-offs in Alaskan waters had been rare but ocean temperature increases —  which cause the fish seabirds prey on to die or migrate — have been accompanied by significant seabird declines.
Seabirds die-offs threaten food security for many remote native Alaskan communities who depend on the birds and their eggs for subsistence foods. Indigenous people also see the birds as a critical part of their cultural heritage.
“The peoples of the Arctic experience change as a result of multiple disturbances accumulated over the years and, increasingly, over generations,” Matthew Druckenmiller, a research scientist with NSIDC and the lead editor of the 2022 Arctic Report Card, told CNN. “That, to me, is a human story — and that same thing can be said for ecosystems. It can be said for individual species.”
It also affects the economy. The dwindling sea ice and shifting marine habitats are together bringing a surge in shipping traffic to the Arctic, bringing more emissions and pollution to the region.
“You’re going to see an increase in ships and it’s happening across all seasons in all regions of the Arctic,” Druckenmiller said. “And so that is really pointing towards a whole new era of impacts both on people living in the Arctic, but also on ecosystems.”
Druckenmiller said climate scientists have long feared that a wetter, less icy and warmer Arctic would become reality. The Arctic Report Card suggests that the region has fundamentally changed over the past decades.
As humans continue to pump planet-heating gases, accelerating the climate crisis, researchers say the Arctic will continue to lose its ability to help regulate the world’s climate.
“The time is now — the Arctic really is an example for the rest of the world on the pace of change and how far reaching implications can be,” Druckenmiller said. “The world really needs to understand that that the Arctic is key to the global climate system.”"
A trash heap 62 meters high shows the scale of India’s climate challenge,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/india/india-bhalswa-landfill-pollution-climate-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"A trash heap 62 meters high shows the scale of India’s climate challenge
At the Bhalswa landfill in northwest Delhi, a steady flow of jeeps zigzag up the trash heap to dump more garbage on a pile now over 62 meters (203 feet) high.
Fires caused by heat and methane gas sporadically break out – the Delhi Fire Service Department has responded to 14 fires so far this year – and some deep beneath the pile can smolder for weeks or months, while men, women and children work nearby, sifting through the rubbish to find items to sell.
Some of the 200,000 residents who live in Bhalswa say the area is uninhabitable, but they can’t afford to move and have no choice but to breathe the toxic air and bathe in its contaminated water.
Bhalswa is not Delhi’s largest landfill. It’s about three meters lower than the biggest, Ghazipur, and both contribute to the country’s total output of methane gas.
Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, but a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because methane traps more heat. India creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country, according to GHGSat, which monitors methane via satellites.
And India comes second only to China for total methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global Methane Tracker.
As part of his “Clean India” initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal, if achieved, could relieve some of the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions.
India wants to lower its methane output, but it hasn’t joined the 130 countries who have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, a pact to collectively cut global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.
India says it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill.
In a statement last year, Minister of State for Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change Ashwini Choubey said pledging to reduce India’s total methane output could threaten the livelihood of farmers and affect India’s trade and economic prospects.
But it’s also facing challenges in reducing methane from its steaming mounds of trash.
‘Here we are, with no relief’
When Narayan Choudhary, 72, moved to Bhalswa in 1982, he said it was a “beautiful place,” but that all changed 12 years later when the first rubbish began arriving at the local landfill.
In the years since, the Bhalswa dump has grown nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal, becoming a landmark in its own right and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes, affecting the health of people who live there.
Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He said he nearly died when a large fire broke out at Bhalswa in April that burned for days. “I was in terrible shape. My face and nose were swollen. I was on my death bed,” he said.
“Two years ago we protested … a lot of residents from this area protested (to get rid of the waste),” Choudhary said. “But the municipality didn’t cooperate with us. They assured us that things will get better in two years but here we are, with no relief.”
The dump site exhausted its capacity in 2002, according to a 2020 report on India’s landfills from the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), a nonprofit research agency in New Delhi, but without government standardization in recycling systems and greater industry efforts to reduce plastic consumption and production, tonnes of garbage continue to arrive at the site daily.
Bhalswa isn’t the only dump causing distress to residents nearby – it is one of three landfills in Delhi, overflowing with decaying waste and emitting toxic gases into the air.
Across the country, there are more than 3,100 landfills. Ghazipur is the biggest in Delhi, standing at 65 meters (213 feet), and like Bhalswa, it surpassed its waste capacity in 2002 and currently produces huge amounts of methane.
According to GHGSat, on a single day in March, more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked from the site every hour.
“If sustained for a year, the methane leak from this landfill would have the same climate impact as annual emissions from 350,000 US cars,” said GHGSat CEO Stephane Germain.
Dangerous toxins in groundwater
Methane emissions aren’t the only hazard that stem from landfills like Bhalswa and Ghazipur. Over decades, dangerous toxins have seeped into the ground, polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby.
In May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the ground water around the Bhalswa landfill. And according to the results, ground water within at least a 500-meter (1,600-foot) radius around the waste site is contaminated.
In the first lab report, levels of ammonia and sulphate were significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government.
Results from the second lab report showed levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) – the amount of inorganic salts and organic matter dissolved in the water – detected in one of the samples was almost 19 times the acceptable limit, making it unsafe for human drinking.
The Bureau of Indian Standards sets the acceptable limit of TDS at 500 milligrams/liter, a figure roughly seen as “good” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Anything over 900 mg/l is considered “poor” by the WHO, and over 1,200 mg/l is “unacceptable.”
According to Richa Singh from the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), the TDS of water taken near the Bhalswa site was between 3,000 and 4,000 mg/l. “This water is not only unfit for drinking but also unfit for skin contact,” she said. “So it can’t be used for purposes like bathing or cleaning of the utensils or cleaning of the clothes.”
Dr. Nitesh Rohatgi, the senior director of medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, urged the government to study the health of the local population and compare it to other areas of the city, “so that in 15 to 20 years’ time, we are not looking back and regretting that we had a higher cancer incidence, higher health hazards, higher health issues and we didn’t look back and correct them in time.”
Most people in Bhalswa rely on bottled water for drinking, but they use local water for other purposes – many say they have no choice.
“The water we get is contaminated, but we have to helplessly store it and use it for washing utensils, bathing and at times drinking too,” said resident Sonia Bibi, whose legs are covered in a thick, red rash.
Jwala Prashad, 87, who lives in a small hut in an alleyway near the landfill, said the pile of putrid trash had made his life “a living hell.”
“The water we use is pale red in color. My skin burns after bathing,” he said, as he tried to soothe red gashes on his face and neck.
“But I can’t afford to ever leave this place,” he added.
Waste target in doubt
More than 2,300 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste arrive at Delhi’s largest dump in Ghazipur every day, according to a report released in July by a joint committee formed to find a way to reduce the number of fires at the site.
That’s the bulk of the waste from the surrounding area – only 300 tonnes is processed and disposed of by other means, the report said. And less than 7% of legacy waste had been bio-mined, which involves excavating, treating and potentially reusing old rubbish.
The Municipal Corporation of Delhi deploys drones every three months to monitor the size of the trash heap and is experimenting with ways to extract methane from the trash mountain, the report said.
But too much rubbish is arriving every day to keep up. The committee said bio-mining had been “slow and tardy” and it was “highly unlikely” the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (which has now merged with North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations) would achieve its target of “flattening the garbage mountain” by 2024.
“No effective plans to reduce the height of the garbage mountain have been made,” the report said. Furthermore, “it should have proposed a long time ago that future dumping of garbage in them would pollute the groundwater systems,” the report added.
CNN sent a series of questions along with the data from the water testing questionnaire to India’s Environment and Health Ministries. There has been no response from the ministries.
In a 2019 report, the Indian government recommended ways to improve the country’s solid waste management, including formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants in the country.
While some improvements have been made, such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste, Delhi’s landfills continue to accumulate waste.
In October, the National Green Tribunal fined the state government more than $100 million for failing to dispose of more than 30 million metric tonnes of waste across its three landfill sites.
“The problem is Delhi doesn’t have a concrete solid waste action plan in place,” said Singh from the CSE. “So we are talking here about dump site remediation and the treatment of legacy waste, but imagine the fresh waste which is generated on a regular basis. All of that is getting dumped everyday into these landfills.”
“(So) let’s say you are treating 1,000 tons of legacy (waste) and then you are dumping 2,000 tons of fresh waste every day it will become a vicious cycle. It will be a never ending process,” Singh said.
“Management of legacy waste, of course, is mandated by the government and is very, very important. But you just can’t start the process without having an alternative facility of fresh waste. So that’s the biggest challenge.”"
Ski resorts are melting. Here’s what that means for winter vacations,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/skiing-environment-climate-change-scn/index.html,"Ski resorts are melting. Here’s what that means for winter vacations
How do you turn a ski resort “green?” The easy answer is to wait until summer.
But environmentally green? That’s more complicated, and the paradox facing the ski industry right now.
Winter sports fans are drawn to the mountains for the pristine wild environments, energizing views, pure air and hearty fun in the snow.
But the energy needed for mountain resorts comes at a price, threatening the very premise of a pastime wedded to the natural world and its winter bounty.
Ski lifts need power to keep turning all season, resort buildings need energy, snow groomers need fuel and guests need to travel, often creating large carbon footprints from long flights.
And faced with the climate crisis and rising temperatures, resorts now need water-thirsty snow cannons to ensure enough of the white stuff for the business to operate. And that doesn’t even factor in the physical and visual impact of development on the alpine environment.
Planet-warming emissions are rising so quickly worldwide that experts at the World Meteorological Organization estimates that we could see another hottest year on record within the next five years, beating the previous record set in 2016.
The consequences could be devastating for the planet, and many low-level ski resorts are already under severe threat because of a lack of snow.
But thankfully, resorts across the globe appear sincere about helping tackle the climate crisis, with hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on myriad green initiatives, from small-scale in-resort activations to long-term systemic change.
Pledges
In France, where ski resorts generate about $1.6 billion annually, the umbrella body for resort operators, Domaines Skiable de France, has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2037, not including the emissions incurred by local municipalities or visitors.
“It’s a worldwide responsibility to do something,” said Gilles Delaruelle, the head of tourism for Courchevel, one of French skiing’s top resorts and part of the vast Les 3 Vallees area.
“We’ve seen there is climate change on the mountains, we’ve seen different temperatures, we’ve seen new highs on the top of the mountain, we saw the snow not coming like in the past at the same period and at the same level. There is a lot of change and we have to take care of that.
“It’s not a marketing position, it’s a responsibility that everyone needs to have for the next generation. If we don’t protect the nature, we won’t have skiing for the future.”
The four biggest US operators with a collective 71 ski resorts in North America have agreed to collaborate in reducing energy use and “aggressively pursue” renewable energy sources, reduce waste and promote advocacy. The operators are Alterra Mountain Company (including Mammoth and Steamboat), Vail Resorts (including Vail, Park City, Beaver Creek, Whistler), Boyne Resorts (including Big Sky and POWDR (including Snowbird).
“The industry depends utterly on a stable climate and a pristine natural world,” said Auden Schendler, senior vice president of sustainability for the Aspen Skiing Company. “That’s what we’re selling so it’s obvious we should have a role in protecting that.
“We have to run our lifts, we have to heat our hotels and restaurants and we have to make snow. In all of those applications you say, ‘How can we do those most efficiently?’”
Schendler said that while on-site activations are “good business,” it is advocacy, political pressure and movement building that are Aspen’s main weapon in combating climate change, using the fame and influence of the resort to tackle the issue closer to the source.
“The major impact of a ski resort on climate would be remaining silent on climate,” said Schendler. “If you care about this issue, your obligation is not so much to reduce your energy use, it’s to make sure your trade groups are pushing on the politics of climate, it’s to have your CEO educate the public and your guests, that’s the opportunity.
“Ski resorts have big impacts in energy use, transportation and operations, but if you fix the energy system through your advocacy you fix those problems.”
Red herring
Schendler points to a complex 15-year project to encourage Aspen Skiing Company’s utility Holy Cross Energy to switch from mostly coal fuel to mostly renewables, with a pledge to get to 100% renewable energy – from about 60% now – by 2030.
“It took forever, it was difficult, but that changed not just us but our competitors,” said Schendler. “The point is, that’s big-scale change and that’s not the kind of thing you typically hear sustainability executives talking about.”
In another project, Aspen Skiing company spent $5.34 million in 2012 on a plant that converts methane from a coal mine into electricity, which has nearly repaid the original investment.
Aspen also helped develop the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) scheme for green buildings in 1991 and is now developing all-electric buildings, alongside an array of solar projects to supplement its green energy supply.
Schendler, though, warns that carbon neutrality can sometimes be a red herring as paying for schemes to offset emissions doesn’t achieve systemic change.
The website Save Our Snow, which collates sustainability stories from the world’s 250 leading ski resorts, claims 58 are now solely powered by green energy, with 56 of those generating some or all of that on site.
Vail Resorts says it has achieved 85% renewable energy for its resorts as part of its EpicPromise to be net zero by 2030, while Big Sky Resort in Montana operates on 100% renewable electric energy as of 2021 and Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming is powered solely by an Idaho wind farm.
In Europe many ski resort operators have been using 100% green energy for a number of years, including St. Anton, Lech-Zurs, Seefeld and Solden in Austria, Les 3 Vallees, Val d’Isere, La Plagne and Les Arcs in France, Pyha and Ruka in Finland, and Laax and Saas-Fee in Switzerland.
“Systemic solutions are the way we need to deal with climate change, we need to get to net zero by 2050 or sooner, ideally,” said Dominic Winter of Protect Our Winters UK, part of the global climate change lobby group founded by American professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones in 2007.
Grooming
The energy use of resort towns, as opposed to the operations side, is often the biggest contributor to the overall carbon footprint, but high on the list of emissions is the snow-grooming service, in which a fleet of specialist machines smooth down the runs each night to make for a better skiing and snowboarding experience.
Domaines Skiables de France says 94% of greenhouse gas emissions from its operations come from the diesel used to power the grooming machines, or piste bashers. Lift operations (4%) and snowmaking (2%) comprise the rest.
As such, many resorts are working with grooming-machine manufacturers to trial alternative sources of fuel as well as next-generation snow groomers with hybrid diesel-electric, electric or hydrogen engines.
The Compagnie des Alpes (CDA), which operates a number of high-profile French resorts, including Val d’Isere, Tignes, Chamonix and Les Arcs, will switch all 130 of its grooming machines to synthetic HVO fuel (hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste) next winter. It should reduce CO2 emissions by 90% and fine particles by 65%.
The group, which is exploring electric and hydrogen groomers with French manufacturer CM Dupon as part of a pledge to be carbon neutral by 2030, says the HVO fuel will lead to a reduction of 9,900 tonnes of CO2 equivalent or 72% of the direct carbon emissions of all its mountain activities excluding electricity. CDA will also educate groomer drivers and lift operators in the most efficient ways of operating to save fuel and energy.
The Swiss resort of Zermatt pays for more expensive sulfur-free “eco speed” diesel for its fleet of working machines, including 29 groomers, which adds about CHF 40,000 each year ($41,000) but generates 11% less carbon monoxide and reduces the concentration of hydrocarbons by 15%.
SATA, the lift company for Les Deux Alpes and l’Alpe d’Huez in France, announced in January 2022 it will partner with Green Corp Konnection (GCK) to convert five groomers and three buses into hydrogen, while Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico, says it will be the first US resort to introduce an all-electric groomer.
“We have the greenest cats available but it’s a niche technology so we’re a little bit at the mercy of manufacturers,” added Schendler. “The play is to get off diesel and move to electric maybe, but probably more likely hydrogen. That technology will arrive but it’s not there yet at a large scale.”
Snowmaking
Snowmaking is the third major pillar of ski resort operations, necessary to supplement nature’s contribution and ensure runs into resorts and other busy areas have ample coverage.
It works by spraying a high-pressure mist of water into cold air to freeze into snow crystals. Some areas also use a biodegradable nucleating agent or organic particle on which an ice crystal can form more easily.
Val d’Isere’s geography and altitude, with runs ranging from 1,800 meters to over 3,000 meters, means it can open from November through to May, but there are still 900 cannons covering 40% of the ski area, operated by a vast central “snow factory,” the largest artificial snowmaking facility in Europe.
“This is an area that we have been looking into for several years now, and it requires real expertise,” says Aurelie Leveque, Operations Director for Val d’Isère Téléphériques.
“Snow is produced using only water, compressed air and negative temperatures, and when the snow melts, the water goes back into the environment.
“The process doesn’t require any chemical products or additives, and the water that we use comes from the drainage basin that flows into the Isère River, which is filtered before being sent to our snowmaking network.”
Critics suggest snowmaking is a drain on diminishing water resources and energy, with artificial reservoirs creating deforestation, but Schendler suggests the positives outweigh the negatives.
“I’m not really a proponent of snowmaking, I don’t love it, but it’s part of the business and you have to do it as efficiently as you can,” says Schendler.
“Snowmaking is maybe 10% of total energy use on an annual basis. The total water use is a teeny portion of the watershed. It has gotten 10-fold more energy efficient over the last decade because the technology is there.
“Going forward I don’t see us using more energy to make snow. The reason it’s necessary is you have to be able to open your door at a certain time.”
The big, green picture
Many resorts are now taking a holistic view of their social, economic and environmental impact, with comprehensive sustainability programs in place, from safeguards over the impact on the fauna and flora of a region, to the removal of obsolete lift installations, to limiting food miles in the resort restaurants.
In Courchevel, there are more trees now than when the resort was first built in 1946, while Val d’Isere was recently awarded the French Flocon Vert sustainability certification, is making big strides in the conservation of endangered black grouse.
However, resort expansion and linking neighboring ski areas to form mega resorts has become a modern trend, motivated by commercialism but often highly controversial.
The long-mooted plan to connect Solden’s Otztal glacier to the Pitztal glacier, installing three new lifts, building restaurants and carving out a tunnel, threatens to change a pristine high alpine environment and its biodiversity forever, according to critics.
The other significant elephant in the room when assessing the environmental impact of ski resorts is the huge carbon footprint of visitors to ski resorts, notably foreigners arriving by emission-heavy flights.
A recent study from the French ski resorts of La Clusaz, Le Grand Bornand and Tignes, found that on average 52% of an individual’s carbon footprint for a day’s skiing came in travel to the resort.
Overall, it seems sustainability is far more than just a buzzword in the mountains, but many green projects are just the tip of the global iceberg.
“Are we winning? No. That’s self-evident,” said Schendler. “You’ve got to reverse global CO2 emissions and bend the curve down and that’s not happening, so we’ve got more work to do.”
Five eco-friendly resorts
Lech-Zurs, Austria: Four biomass heating plants supply nearly 100% of households and businesses, saving about eight million liters of heating oil or 24,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually.
Courchevel, France: Launch of Montagne, Ecology and Technology start-up contest worth 30,000 euros. The 2021 winner has developed pioneering 100% recyclable skis, saving 150,000 pairs of rental skis annually from the trash.
Morzine, France: Discounts offered in resort for those who travel by train to reduce emissions.
Grindelwald, Switzerland: The new V-Cableway Eiger Express operates on a mixture of hydroelectricity and CO2-neutral thermal energy from a wood-fired heating plant that burns forest chips, sawmill residue and waste wood from the region. The latest cableway technology also ensures fewer pylons and less deforestation.

More Americans are moving into harm’s way as climate disasters increase,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/us/americans-moving-to-areas-with-high-climate-risk/index.html,"More Americans are moving into harm’s way as climate disasters increase
People are moving in droves to places with a high risk of climate disasters, researchers say, despite extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity in recent years.
A study released Thursday by researchers from the University of Vermont found that over the past decade, Americans have moved out of some areas prone to scorching summer heat waves and hurricanes – like the Central US and Gulf Coast. Yet many are also migrating into regions afflicted by extreme wildfires, heat and worsening drought, researchers found.

Here’s what you can do to minimize your impactDrink this type of milk to keep yourself and the planet healthy
They also saw an exceptional increase in people moving to hurricane-prone Florida, a growing trend in recent decades.
“What I was quite surprised by is that a lot of these climate risks are not yet affecting people’s decision about where to move,” Mahalia Clark, lead author of the study and graduate fellow at the University of Vermont Gund Institute for Environment, told CNN. “It might be that (disasters) haven’t had as much time to start making their way into people’s minds to really affect them in terms of choices.”
Researchers found an alarming upward trend of people flocking to the wildfire-prone and drought-stricken West, where states are facing unprecedented water shortages. The study’s data shows an uptick in people moving to southern Nevada and parts of Arizona, both of which are struggling with dwindling groundwater and the Colorado River water crisis.
But Americans aren’t factoring those risks into their decision to move, researchers showed. The study highlighted other aspects such as mountains, beautiful scenery, lakes or ocean and outdoor recreation as key influences in the decision to move to the West.
“Decisions about migration is this very complex personal decision, where people weigh factors about job opportunities, where the family lives, and potentially also some environmental factors like a pleasant climate, nice weather, beautiful scenery, or potentially some risk factors,” Clark said.
They are also migrating into major cities like Nashville, Charlotte, DC and Atlanta as well as suburbs in the Pacific Northwest, where urban development is increasing along with climate risks.
Meanwhile, people are moving away from areas across much of the Great Plains, the Midwest, along the Mississippi River, as well as over large portions of New York State and West Virginia – regions where flooding is common.
And while Americans are less attracted to some areas where hurricanes are frequent – mostly along the Eastern Seaboard – coastal areas that are at high risk to the most destructive storms, like the coasts of Florida and Texas, remain key migration hot spots.
Clark said that’s because many people – particularly retirees in Florida – are attracted to the warm climate, beaches and other quality-of-life factors that outweigh the seemingly remote risk of a life-threatening hurricane.
Still, she said, when people choose between counties with similar population density and features within the state, they’re likely to opt for the county with lower hurricane risk.
The findings reflect a 2021 report by real estate company Redfin that found Americans are moving to places with high climate hazards such as heat, drought, fire and floods. And in some of these places, home prices are even increasing as demand surges.
Thursday’s study “suggests that many people may be in for an unpleasant surprise when they move to a new part of the country and don’t realize that the hazards in their environment have also changed dramatically,” Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at the Yale School of Environment, who is not involved with the study, told CNN.
“I’m not surprised that wildfires and smoke don’t weigh heavily in people’s decisions to move because these events are often localized and are still relatively infrequent, even if they are becoming more common and more dangerous,” she added.
Researchers gathered data on migration from the US Census Bureau, natural hazard frequencies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as forest cover data from the National Land Cover Database to consider several different factors that might affect people’s decisions.
But Marlon points to existing gaps in some of this data that might impact the linkage the authors are trying to make. For instance, the FEMA heat wave data that the researchers use show large parts of the country, particularly in the Rocky Mountains, with missing heat ratings.
“(The authors) say mountainous areas tend to not have heat waves, but the missing (FEMA) data spans more than just mountainous counties,” she said. “It can be difficult to measure weather and climate hazards that vary so much over space and time.”
Researchers say they plan to delve more into this space to further understand how Americans are migrating within the country and what influences their decisions. For now, they say, city planners and policymakers need to find ways to stop adding new developments in climate-vulnerable places to protect the people that are moving in.
If they don’t, the socioeconomic toll will only worsen as climate change advances.
“Moving more folks into high-risk areas is going to prove exceedingly costly,” Marlon said. “The question just becomes a matter of who is going to pay for the damages.”"

Two winter storms in less than a week will bring more than a foot of snow to the mountains, wind gusts of over 70 mph leading to the possibility of a wall of dust and the high danger of fire to the central and western US.
The winter storm that dumped up to two feet of snow across the Cascades and the northern Rockies in the Northwest on Thursday will impact the Central US Friday.

“The cold front has featured everything from 82 mph winds to snow squall conditions to thundersnow,” the National Weather Service office in Salt Lake City said.
Snow is still coming down at the rate of more than an inch an hour, creating slick roads and dangerous travel especially through the mountain passes.
With several feet of new snow in the mountains, an avalanche warning has been issued for the Central Sierra, including Greater Lake Tahoe through Friday evening.

More than 25 million people are under wind alerts that stretches across 17 states from Utah to Indiana.
“Guidance has very strong downsloping winds coming off of the Front Range and extending onto the Colorado Plains where the potential for 70+ mph winds exist,” the weather service in Goodland, Kansas, said.
The winds will create a fire hazard for the region, where quick ignitions and fast-growing wildfires would form, due to low humidity levels and warmer temperatures ahead of the cold front.
“Confidence has also increased in blowing dust including the potential of a wall of dust developing along the cold front,” the weather service warned.
That wall of dust is referred to as a haboob. It’s when strong winds – like winds associated with an approaching cold front – pick up dust and create a wall of dust that can engulf an entire city and cause nearly blackout conditions.
“If this were to occur dangerous travel conditions would develop with less than 1 mile visibility likely until the wall of dust passes,” the Goodland weather service warned.
Another winter storm expected to bring up to a foot of snow
Just as this snowstorm moves on, another one is on its heels that is expected to bring even more snow and rain to many drought-stricken areas.
“Another round of heavy snow appears likely for the Sierra Nevada by late Saturday and into Sunday as the bulk of the moisture associated with the system pushes onshore,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
This will bring beneficial snowfall to the Sierra, with several rounds of snow falling between Saturday and Monday, making this next event much more prolonged than the storm this week.
“In the Sierra, snow accumulations have a 95-100% chance of 12” … with a 30-50% chance of seeing up to 3 feet for areas along the Eastern Sierra,” the weather service in Reno explained.

Coastal areas in the West could also see beneficial rain with this system. The weather service in Eureka, California, noted the “possibility of isolated thunderstorms capable of producing small hail” near the coast.
As the system moves east early next week, another round of snow will fill in across the Rockies.
“Noteworthy snow is also expected across the higher terrain of Utah, Wyoming, and central Colorado as the moisture plume from the Pacific advects farther inland, with up to a foot of accumulation possible,” the prediction center said.
A fast start to snow season, with a long way to go
This early-season snow is welcomed across much of the West because it can help with the drought. However, one snowstorm does not mean the whole season will remain snowy.
Last year, California had its wettest start to the water year in more than 40 years. However, it quickly flat-lined in terms of precipitation and ended the season with snowpack at just roughly 35% of normal.
In terms of snowpack conditions in the region right now, the Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOTEL network is currently reporting the following snow water equivalent percentages of median for the most recent update (November 29):
Pacific Northwest 134%
California 135%
Great Basin 157%
Lower Colorado 152%
Upper Colorado 98%
While these numbers are off to a great start, they need to stay that way to have a big impact on the drought conditions that have been plaguing the west for decades, and in turn the water supply.

Covering old buildings in a ‘second skin’ could slash heating bills and emissions
With soaring energy prices, home insulation is becoming increasingly important. But old buildings that fail to keep in the heat are not only expensive for residents — they’re also costly for the climate.
In the European Union, where buildings account for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions, new construction alone won’t be enough to fix the problem. For that, old homes need to be retrofitted to make them more energy efficient.
Ecoworks, a German startup, thinks it has the answer. The company uses laser scanning technology to create a digital twin of a building. It then produces prefabricated panels that fit precisely over the old building, improving its insulation.
“The world cannot afford, financially but also from the CO2 budget, to tear down all the old houses and build new ones with cement and steel,” says Emanuel Heisenberg, the company’s founder and CEO. “We need to renovate … and transform buildings into carbon sinks.”
Shunning the carbon-intensive materials typically used in construction, Ecoworks uses renewables such as wood for the paneling and cellulose for insulation. It installs electric heat pumps inside homes, which it says are more efficient than gas boilers, and fits a modular roof with built-in solar panels, helping the buildings produce more energy than they consume.
The company’s first major renovation project, in 2019, was of a 1930s apartment block near Düsseldorf. The building was hugely inefficient, using 369 kilowatt-hours of energy per square meter, way above the EU average. Since the Ecoworks renovation, the homes produce 20% more energy than they consume, says Heisenberg.
Speed and efficiency
Heisenberg says the entire “second skin” — which includes windows, ventilation, heating and hot water pipes — can be installed in just two to three weeks. He adds that 80% of the on-site labor that would normally be needed is moved to the factory, making it cheaper than conventional methods, and less disruptive. Residents only have to leave their homes for about two days with Ecoworks retrofits, as opposed to six to eight weeks with conventional renovation.
Despite the benefits of retrofitting, progress has been slow. According to the European Commission, about 35% of Europe’s buildings are more than 50 years old and almost 75% are energy inefficient. Only 1% is renovated each year.
The Commission has introduced stronger regulations on energy performance to incentivize developers. Public and residential buildings deemed the least efficient are required by law to be renovated before 2030.
“Building energy performance is vital to achieving our decarbonization targets,” says Ian Hamilton, a professor of energy at University College London. Hamilton is author of the UN 2022 global status report for buildings and construction, which found that the sector’s CO2 emissions hit a new high in 2021.
“Not only will energy efficiency reduce the amount of renewable energy needed, but more efficient buildings can be lower cost, more comfortable, healthier, and more resilient to climate change,” he says.
Introducing building energy codes and financial incentives will be crucial in increasing investment in renovation, he adds.
In Germany, this is already happening, according to Heisenberg. “Now they [building developers] are faced with regulation, they have to renovate,” he says. This year the company has retrofitted 320 apartments, and demand is rising, he adds. Next year Ecoworks will start the planning process for more than double that number.
So far, the company has focused on Germany, but by 2024 Ecoworks wants to start expanding into other parts of Europe, such as Austria and Switzerland, which have a similar stock of apartment blocks built between the 1950s and the 1980s.

"With dreams of Mars, this young activist works for a greener future on Earth",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/asia/kazumi-muraki-carbon-fuel-climate-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"With dreams of Mars, this young activist works for a greener future on Earth
When he was just 15, Kazumi Muraki created a small, portable device to capture carbon from the atmosphere. Seven years later, the Japanese chemist is researching how to convert this captured carbon into fuel.
As a young boy, Muraki was never very interested in science, he tells CNN, until his grandfather gave him the children’s novel “George’s Secret Key to the Universe,” by the late Stephen Hawking and his daughter Lucy.
Muraki says the titular character goes on a quest to find a suitable planet for human life and settles on Mars. Amazed by pictures of the red planet and its blue sunset, at just 10-years-old Muraki made it his life mission to get to Mars.
From then on, he says, he started researching what it would take to live there.
“I found that (the) Martian atmosphere is (made) of 95% of carbon dioxide,” which is lethal to humans. He adds, “if we want to live on Mars, we have to remove Martian carbon dioxide.”
He realized his research to remove carbon from Mars’ atmosphere could also be helpful here on Earth. “Carbon dioxide is the main cause of the climate crisis,” he says, adding that removing it from the air is one way to curb it.
In 2015, Muraki created Hiyassy, an AI carbon capture device the size of carry-on luggage. It’s intended for home and office use, so that anyone can help stop global warming from anywhere, he says. Hiyassy works by pulling in air and filtering it through an alkaline solution before releasing it back out.
Now, he’s onto the next stage of research: carbon recycling. His Tokyo-based company, Carbon Recovering Research Agency, is working to make an alternative fuel from captured carbon.
“We are now creating a diesel fuel from carbon dioxide,” he says, adding that it could be available in the next year or so.
In the meantime, he’s still dreaming about the red planet: “I want to be the first man (to) land on Mars.”

Australia will see more extreme weather events, putting strain on economy, report shows
Australia will continue to see a spike in extreme rainfall and heat, as well as more dangerous fire events, its government agencies warned Wednesday.
In a biennial climate report, Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and the Bureau of Meteorology said it had already found “an increase in extreme heat events, intense heavy rainfall, longer fire seasons and sea level rise” recently.
The changes are happening more rapidly and will put further pressure on Australia to transition its economy away from fossil fuels, the agencies warned.
“The threats caused by climate change, including extreme rainfall, droughts, heatwaves and bushfires, are already having widespread impacts on Australia’s agricultural industry, affecting food production and supply chains,” Michael Robertson, director of agriculture and food at CSIRO, said in a statement.
Australia is one of the world’s leading exporters of agricultural goods such as beef, wine, sugar, cotton, and wool. It’s also known for its wealth of natural resources, such as iron ore, coal, and gas.
“We’re facing significant challenges to support and coordinate the shifts across infrastructure, regulation, skills, technology, finance and investment that is needed for the transition to a low-emission economy,” Michael Battaglia, lead of Towards Net Zero Mission, a division of CSIRO, said in the statement.
Australia has seen the devastating effects of the climate crisis up close recently, from marine heat waves that have caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef to extreme weather events including flooding.
This year, the country experienced a rare third consecutive La Niña weather pattern, which brought heavier and more frequent downpours, causing rivers to burst their banks, flooding communities near the coast and inland.
After years of dealing with drought, farmers have lost crops due to too much water, with forecasters warning of more to come.
Climate was a key issue at the recent election in May, when the new Labor government took power with a promise to boost renewable energy. Soon after taking office, the government increased Australia’s plans to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 on 2005 levels — a more ambitious target than its predecessor but one climate experts say is still not high enough.
The economic fallout has been well documented. Over the past 50 years, “climate-induced extreme weather events including drought, fires, and floods have cost Australian communities an estimated 120 billion [Australian dollars] ($79.8 billion),” according to the Minderoo Foundation. The nonprofit organization shared the tally in a January report.

A new children’s book about glaciers aims to make activism second nature,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/world/glaciers-meltdown-book-children-climate-change-scn/index.html,"A new children’s book about glaciers aims to make activism second nature
Today’s kids have the power and skills to change the world. But when it comes to topics like the climate crisis, reaching children in a way that sparks their interest — and empowers them to believe they can truly make a difference — can be tricky.
“Kids need to hear about climate change. But the greatest danger is that it just sounds so dreadful and people tune it out, and that’s bad news,” explained Anita Sanchez, author of the new book “MELTDOWN: Discover Earth’s Irreplaceable Glaciers and Learn What You Can Do to Save Them,” designed for young readers ages 8 to 12.
Featuring emotional and informative illustrations by Brooklyn-based artist Lily Padula, the book taps into the sheer beauty and wonder of the world’s glaciers, paired with accessible science to give kids tools they can use to help save them.
Sanchez was on a “typical tourist trip to Iceland,” visiting the Vatnajokull glacier — Iceland’s largest ice cap — when she realized there was a children’s book in what she was witnessing.
“We were on the moraine, the land near the glacier,” said Sanchez, who worked for 25 years for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and has written 19 books on environmental science.
“It was muddy, dirty and gray. Then, when we came to the side of the glacier itself, there was a sense of climbing up onto the back of a big animal.” Glacier mice, which are clumps of moss Sanchez said looked like “green furry ping pong balls,” were being blown across the landscape in herd-like formations.
“There was this freshness to the air, there was a small crevasse you could look into and see this really deep sapphire blue, down deep,” she said. “I came off the glacier going, ‘There’s gotta be a book here somewhere.’”
At first, she thought she’d create a picture book on the topic, before realizing she “had to go bigger and deeper for slightly older kids.” Middle-grade students, she decided, were the ideal audience to reach.
“They’re old enough to really take in some tough science but still young enough to have that enthusiasm and love of animals and adventure that some of us lose when we reach adulthood,” Sanchez said. “Kids need to get excited about the wild places of the world before they become activists to help preserve them.”
Speaking with CNN, Sanchez shared how she reaches out to young readers about the climate crisis, how she’s inspired by ecosystems that glaciers support and how adults can inspire the young people in their lives to act, too, in the most accessible ways.
This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
CNN: How did you make the concept of climate change relatable and interesting to younger readers?
Anita Sanchez: This is the toughest book I’ve ever written because there’s a lot of tough science — what climate change is, why it’s happening, and what the evidence is that glacial melt is human caused. So I tried to imagine I’m talking to readers rather than writing a textbook. I approached the book and topic like a fiction writer.
The first paragraph describes the sounds — crunch, crunch, crunch — your crampons make as you walk in the hard-packed snow of a glacier. There’s the sense of the glacier being something alive. You don’t actually feel it moving, but there’s this sense that it’s different from a big pile of snow. You get the sense that it’s powerful and that you’re in a dramatic place. It’s like being on the back of a big frozen animal.
Throughout the book, I try to make the glacier a sort of character, even though the book is non-fiction. Indigenous people who have lived with glaciers have beliefs that glaciers speak and that they can hear us. When you hear the sounds they make, it’s impressive.
I was visiting Northern Cascades National Park in Washington state in early May, when the (annual spring) melt had started, and there was crackling and roaring and a big ‘hmmm’ sound as part of the glacier broke off and came crackling down. It was like a distant thunderstorm, a sense of power. I try to get these things across (to my readers).
CNN: What do you think might surprise young readers to learn about glaciers in the book?
Sanchez: To keep it relevant to young readers, I keep bringing the focus back to the animals that depend on glaciers. In Washington state, the salmon depend on glacial melt, and grizzly bears are in turn dependent on salmon. There are ice worms that live on glaciers, they’re as tiny as an eyelash. And rosy finches depend on those ice worms for food. … I try to make the glaciers seem alive to make them more relatable, and along with it the message of why we need to save them.
CNN: For most people, the chance to walk on a real glacier will remain a pipe dream. What are to be awed by nature wherever we live?
Sanchez: Ideally, I wish every child could take a walk on a glacier. Sadly. it’s not that accessible for most people. In the United States, you need to go to a national park in the northwest or to Alaska. To places like North Cascades National Park or Glacier National Park in Montana. For many people, it’s beyond their means.
I usually write about places closer to (my) home (in New York), so even for me glaciers were a stretch.  And while it’s wonderful to write about glaciers and rainforests and faraway places, I think that real love of the outdoors can come from your backyard, your local park, the squirrel at your local nature center. I’ve taught for 25 years in the outdoor realm, and so many kids have barely been off the sidewalks. Getting out into any form of nature is a real adventure for them.
CNN: What are some of the tools your book gives young readers to take action to save the glaciers?
Sanchez: I think most people of any age hear the words ‘climate change’ on the news and reach for the mute button. It’s like we can’t take any more bad news. I really think the way to inspire activism and this message that we conserve only what we love is to get excited about the beauty and fun of nature.
It starts with the small stuff, like working with your family to live more sustainably. Think about where you buy your food, where does your food come from? The book explains (the concept of your) carbon footprint. But realistically, we need bigger action. We need to harness the power of our governments to take action and get big corporations to take action.
I really stress the power of voting. Kids can’t vote, of course, but they can be huge advocates for getting people to vote — and for candidates who take strong action on climate change. Kids can find out how registration works in their state. How city ballots work in their state. It’s all online, and most kids are computer savvy. Do you know where your polling place is, do you know the hours?
Many kids are masters of social media and can help spread these messages.  They really know how to use social media to spread the word in a way my generation doesn’t. There are, of course, limits to what a 10-year-old can do. But they have power, even if they don’t know they have it.
CNN: What’s the most important message you hope young readers will take away from your book?
Sanchez: The last section of the book is about how to help, how to become an activist. Kids need to get active. They can really make a difference. I think it’s easy for kids to feel like they have no power, or they have no say. That scientists know everything, that everything has been done. But it’s not true.
There are so many more mysteries. Nobody knows how ice worms survive on glaciers, for example, how they manage not to freeze. For kids, this world is their future. They really need to be active, and there are so many things they can do. One letter from a kid to a school board or to an editor can really start the ball rolling for change in their town.
I would love to hear from just one young person that reading the book made them take a definite action, made them do something. It doesn’t matter what, it’s that first baby step."
COP27 summit agrees to help climate victims. But it does nothing to stop fossil fuels,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/world/cop27-egypt-agreement-climate-intl/index.html,"COP27 summit agrees to help climate victims. But it does nothing to stop fossil fuels
The world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.
Negotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.
The agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
However, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.
“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.
Addressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.
“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.
Victory for climate crisis victims
The agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.
It marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.
Negotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.
“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”
The creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.
Protests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.
Still, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”
The fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.
Reaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.
The US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.
“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”
Details on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.
And while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.
“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”
An outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.
“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”
For many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.
“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”
Text on 1.5 degrees remains
Global scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.
Beyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.
But while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.
“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”
It took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.
On Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”
“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.
The talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.
The US and China resume climate talks
Aside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.
After China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.
“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.
The two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.
Unlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.
Li Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”
“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”"

‘It’s like living in an igloo.’ People are turning off their heat as prices surge
As the first frigid weather of autumn chills the Northeast, many people are faced with a tough decision: deal with the surging costs of heating their homes or live without it.
Home heating prices are skyrocketing yet again this winter, up 18% nationwide on top of last year’s 17% spike, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).
Charmaine Johnson works in the call center at Philadelphia’s Heater Hotline, part of a non-profit that assists low-income families with their heating systems and bills. Johnson, 63, can relate to the concerns she’s hearing all day. She, too, is struggling to afford her heating bills.
With help from her son, Johnson just paid more than $1,000 to fill part of her oil tank, which she hopes will last her most of the winter.
Johnson says she doesn’t qualify for government assistance with her heating bills. As inflation also pushes up her food budget and other expenses, she is bundling up and keeping the heat turned down, hoping to stretch that oil for as long as possible.
“It’s miserable,” she said. “It’s like living in an igloo.”
Several factors are driving hikes in home heating prices, including the war in Ukraine, OPEC+ cuts, a surge in energy exports, lower energy inventories, and a high demand for natural gas in the US electric power sector, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
EIA projects heating a home with natural gas will cost an extra 25% this winter, and heating with electric will run 11% higher. The steepest hike will be on heating oil, which is expected to be 45% more expensive than last winter, squeezing roughly 5 million households, mostly in the Northeast.
Tim Wiseley is keeping the heat off at his home outside Philadelphia, even as temperatures dip toward freezing. He wants his heating oil to last as long as possible and filling his tank costs roughly $1,500.
“It’s 50 or 55 degrees in here. To me that’s not unbearable yet,” Wiseley said, adding that he’ll turn the heat on when his “teeth chatter.”
The 67-year-old is retired, living month-to-month on Social Security benefits. He lost his wife last year, and his medical bills are adding to the long list of expenses.
“You can’t go food shopping and get oil. It’s one or the other,” he said.
Wiseley believes he’ll run out of heating oil at some point this winter. He’s not sure what he’ll do when that happens.
“It’s a horrible feeling,” he said. “It’s a feeling I wouldn’t wish on anyone.”
This winter, the Biden administration is distributing $4.5 billion in federal assistance to help families pay their heating bills.
The funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, stem from regular appropriations by Congress, additional emergency funding lawmakers included in September’s continuing resolution and $100 million from the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed last year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Annette Thomas, 53, and her husband received $500 from that program to help them heat their home near Philadelphia, she said. But it was only enough to fill roughly one third of their oil tank, which Thomas thinks will last just two to three weeks.
“That’s why we’re holding off,” she said. “We haven’t turned our heat on yet. And it’s chilly now.”
They’re trying to pay off their electric bill in the coming days to avoid a shutoff. Plus, their other bills and expenses are way up. So they’re using space heaters and electric blankets to stay warm, hoping to save their heating oil for when their kids come home for Thanksgiving.
“These aren’t luxuries, they’re necessities, and it is a struggle,” Thomas said. “So yes, it’s upsetting. It is.”

US climate envoy John Kerry tests positive for Covid-19 as UN summit heads into overtime,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/world/kerry-covid-cop27-egypt-climate/index.html,"US climate envoy John Kerry tests positive for Covid-19 as UN summit heads into overtime
With just hours left to go to reach an international climate agreement, US climate envoy John Kerry has tested positive for Covid-19 at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, his spokesperson Whitney Smith said.
Smith said in a statement that Kerry is “experiencing mild symptoms” and self-isolating at the summit. As the talks hit a critical stretch, he is “working with his negotiations team and foreign counterparts by phone to ensure a successful outcome of COP27.”
It is bad timing for the chief US climate negotiator to fall ill; the final Friday at the annual summit is always crunch time for negotiators to reach a deal that nearly 200 nations can agree to. But this year the issues are particularly thorny – the US represents a major holdout on the critical issue of a loss and damage fund, which would help the world’s developing and most vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters they did little to cause.
Loss and damage is not the only outstanding issue. World leaders at COP27 are also frantically trying to hash out a deal that would safeguard the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
Just hours before the Sharm el-Sheikh summit was officially due to end on Friday – and as the conference venue was being dismantled around negotiators – this year’s COP president Sameh Shoukry said he was “concerned” by the summit’s lack of progress so far.
“I remain concerned at the number of outstanding issues including on finance, mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and their inter-linkages,” Shoukry told the conference.
“Today, we need to shift gears again. Time is not on our side,” he added.
The Egyptian COP presidency has taken a relaxed approach to Covid-19 at the conference. The organizers did not require participants to be vaccinated or show a negative Covid-19 test when registering, although they “strongly recommended” that attendees be up-to-date with their vaccinations before arriving.
Masks, too, were wholly optional and rare to spot inside the venue – although the number of people wearing them increased noticeably over the past few days.
As the number of people who tested positive grew and the news of a potential outbreak started to spread, more attendees began to mask up. Still, even on Friday, as news of Kerry’s positive test broke, most people remained without masks.
The Chinese delegation stood out by strictly requiring anyone who wanted to step foot inside the country’s pavilion to mask up and sanitize their hands."
These women chase hurricanes to gather crucial weather data,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hurricane-hunters-altius-hnk-climate-spc-intl/index.html,"These women chase hurricanes to gather crucial weather data
“You’re always taught to stay away from hurricanes.”
Lieutenant Commander Danielle Varwig says that’s what most pilots would tell you – but she isn’t like most pilots.
As a hurricane hunter for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Varwig spends her working day chasing the eye of the storm.
It’s not for the thrills, though. Flying over tropical storms and hurricanes across the Caribbean and Atlantic Basin, Varwig and her team at NOAA collect weather data that can help forecast where and when hurricanes will make landfall.
They say that by putting themselves in danger, they hope to keep others out of it.
“It’s lives at risk. We are doing this to help others on the ground that aren’t able to do this for themselves,” says Varwig.
‘A flying science lab’
Varwig pilots a Gulfstream IV jet that flies over the hurricane – when skies above the hurricane are clear, she says it’s possible to get a “surreal” bird’s eye vantage point of the whole storm.
More often than not, though, visibility is poor. “We’re in the clouds, trusting our instruments and flight directors,” says Varwig.
Meteorologist Nikki Hathaway is one of these flight directors. She rides shotgun with Varwig, guiding her through some of the most difficult flying conditions imaginable. Hathaway also accompanies pilots on NOAA’s P-3 Orion planes, which can fly directly into the storm.
These aircraft are “flying science labs” that host up to 18 engineers, data technicians, scientists, and researchers, as well as a variety of tech to help the team gather data, says Hathaway.
The data “goes back down to the National Hurricane Center,” where it’s used “in real-time to make lifesaving decisions impacting the people on the ground potentially in harm’s way,” says Hathaway.
A key piece of tech is a dropsonde, a device that can be dropped from the aircraft, and will collect weather data such as pressure, temperature, and humidity as it falls to Earth. But a dropsonde can only collect data in a single location, and the meteorologists can’t control it once it’s descending, limiting the range of data they can gather.
Hurricane-hunting drones
Now, the team is using storm-chasing drones to gather more data than ever before on their hurricane-hunting missions.
NOAA has been experimenting with the drones, which can be operated remotely, gathering “a totally different scale” of information, says Hathaway. This year, it began testing an unmanned aircraft called Altius, which was deployed during Hurricane Ian in September 2022 – the first hurricane in six years to make landfall in Florida.
With an eight-foot wingspan and weighing just 27 pounds, these drones can fly where the hurricane hunter’s planes cannot. During Hurricane Ian, Altius gathered data on temperature, pressure, and moisture levels in the eye of the storm, as well as circumnavigating the hurricane at various altitudes ranging from 200 feet to 3,000 feet above the water and recording wind speeds that exceeded 216 miles per hour.
The drone can descend to the boundary layer of the hurricane, the part just above the ocean where heat and moisture cause more intense gusts. Gaining information about the turbulence here will help scientists better understand how these storm systems work.
The equipment is still being tested, but Hathaway is excited about how it will improve hurricane modeling and predictions.
“Getting that data in this lowest level (of the storm) is going to be very critical to hurricane forecasting in the future,” she adds.
Pushing boundaries
The work of these hurricane hunters is becoming increasingly important – and dangerous – as climate change causes more devastating hurricanes with greater wind speeds and rainfall.
Based in Florida, Hathaway and her team have witnessed first-hand the threat posed by these extreme weather events. When Hurricane Ian hit their state, it generated once-in-a-thousand-years rainfall and water surges, killing at least 125 people.
“When it’s your people, when it’s impacting your home, there’s that extra element of stress in the back of your head,” says Hathaway. Rising sea levels are likely to worsen flooding from storm surges in future events, making NOAA’s predictions ever more vital.
NOAA isn’t just championing technological innovation at home. Earlier this year, the organization embarked on a “groundbreaking mission” to investigate a hurricane nursery off the coast of West Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands, where many of North America’s severe storms start. It was the first time the hurricane hunters crossed the Atlantic – and they hope that by studying storms before they are fully formed, they can greatly improve forecasts and understand their storm tracks better.
As a mother of two, Varwig is keenly aware of the risks she takes – and more motivated to take them. “I do everything for them,” says Varwig of her children.
While Varwig rejects the label of “female pilot,” she’s aware of the scarcity of women in her field – and hopes she can inspire her children and others to pursue their passions.
As a Black woman, “I want to put myself out there to be a role model to little girls, to little Black girls, people who feel like they may be marginalized and not be able to do what I do or anything similar to that,” says Varwig, adding: “I want to make sure that others can look to me and say, ‘Okay, well she’s doing it, then I can too.’”"
Why the energy transition is so tough for Africa: 600 million people still have no access to power,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/energy/verner-ayukegba-african-energy-chamber-climate-spc-intl/index.html,"Markets

Why the energy transition is so tough for Africa: 600 million people still have no access to power
Africa’s energy sector faces a huge challenge: how to bring reliable access to electricity to hundreds of millions of people, while containing carbon emissions.
Currently, the continent only produces 3% of global greenhouse emissions, although it’s home to one fifth of the world’s population. Nearly all of Africa’s 54 countries have signed the Paris Agreement on climate change, and many have committed to reach net zero by 2050. However, much of the population still lacks access to electricity.
Ahead of COP 27, CNN’s Eleni Giokos discussed this and other topics at Africa Energy Week in Cape Town, with Verner Ayukegba, Senior Vice President of the African Energy Chamber, which works with businesses in the continent and promotes energy growth.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
How would you describe the current state of Africa’s energy portfolio to a global audience?
Ayukegba: With 600 million people without any kind of access to energy, and 900 million people — mostly women and children — without any access to clean cooking fuels, we need to focus on investing significantly into generating power for all of those people. At the African Energy Chamber, we have decided to champion making energy poverty history by 2030. We need to throw everything at it, because at the core of development there is reliable and affordable energy. If you don’t have that, there’s no point talking about access to education or healthcare.
How do you reconcile this developmental challenge with the climate change agenda?
Ayukegba: We shouldn’t have it as a binary situation in that sense. We need to make sure that we solve, of course, the climate issues, but also the power issues. You do not have to get people into a situation where they have to choose either to have a job, or not have a job because of the climate situation.
We need to be able to look at gas-to-power solutions to ensure that people have the power that they need. We need to transition, but we need to consider the social aspects of the transition. I think people miss that a lot and say, “Close this coal mine,” but what they don’t see are the families, the communities, that have grown in and around these industries. So when you talk about transition, it’s not just about power, it’s about people. It’s about people’s lives.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres last year referred to a UN climate report as “code red for humanity.” Does that worry you in terms of what that will mean for Africans?
Ayukegba: It absolutely does, but the thing is, you have to go where the pollution is and ask those who are polluting to cut the pollution.
Africa has several oil and gas-producing nations, but often they are not able to meet their own demand for energy, and end up importing refined oil products. How is that going to change?
Ayukegba: It is certainly not a new problem, and I think the authorities in many of these African countries are trying to address it. Obviously, it’s something that should have been addressed for some time.
It’s fair to say that Nigeria, with a number of projects, is looking to grow infrastructure internally to be able to address that. It’s appalling, there’s no running away from that, but we need to be able to address those deficits and certainly, the governments are trying to.
What do you think the messaging should be at COP27?
Ayukegba: We are going to be there to support a transition towards renewables and towards a world that goes closer to net zero. What we are saying, however, is that you can’t transition in Limpopo [South Africa] in the same way you transition in New York. You certainly cannot transition in London, or in Berlin, or in Stockholm in the same way you transition in Lagos. We have to be realistic about these things. If not, people won’t take us seriously.
Do you feel that African voices were taken seriously at COP26?
Ayukegba: No, clearly not. For anybody who has a constituency with 600 million people without power, you need to talk differently about these issues. We are seeing the problems and the issues that farmers are already having — longer droughts and all of that — and so we agree at the Chamber that we have issues with energy transition, with the way that the climate is changing. However, if in the US your fridge uses more power in a year than an African family, where do we start in terms of addressing the problem?

"Opinion: To help fight the climate crisis, we should plant more trees",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/opinions/climate-crisis-tree-planting-daley-benioff/index.html,"Opinion: To help fight the climate crisis, we should plant more trees
Editor’s Note: Jad Daley is president and CEO of American Forests and a leader of the U.S. chapter of 1t.org. Marc Benioff is the chair and co-CEO of Salesforce. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion on CNN.
When we joined with countries, companies and NGOs two years ago to launch the global partnership 1t.org, we knew it would not be a panacea for climate change. Leaders across the forest-climate movement, including ourselves, have always made clear that the most important step we must take to fight climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In recent months, despite the deadly fires, floods, heat and drought fueled by climate change, a steady stream of criticism has been aimed at the flourishing global movement to use trees as a response to the climate crisis.
Some critics have warned against pretending that planting trees is a permanent climate solution, concerned that reliance on trees will slacken other climate efforts. Others have worried that planting the wrong trees will lead to forests that are less resilient and less biologically diverse.
But we believe it would be a profound mistake to ignore or diminish the indispensable role that protecting and growing trees can play in addressing climate change. In the United States, for example, our forests captured  approximately 13% of gross US greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. In addition to protecting our existing forests, there are millions of acres across America where we can plant and grow more trees, such as reforesting burned areas and planting trees in urban areas. And we know that our efforts must lead to biologically diverse forests, and only in ecosystems where trees belong. That’s why we and our partners adhere to best practices such as the “10 golden rules” for restoring forests.
The private sector has a particularly large role to play here. Companies can bring invaluable resources, skills and technologies to bear in a responsible and science-based manner, for both the forest movement and the broader fight against the climate crisis.
Here’s how:
Be transparent
There must be zero tolerance for “greenwashing,” where a company might exaggerate or falsify the actual climate change impact of its investment in natural climate solutions. Businesses must practice transparency through rigorous public reporting, and by using technologies that enable stakeholders to see exactly what their investments are accomplishing. Stakeholders’ ability to see and verify climate investments can hold businesses accountable and push them to invest in truly rigorous, credible projects.
Go to net zero
Investing in nature-based solutions like trees cannot be an excuse for companies to continue emitting dangerous levels of greenhouse gasses. Companies that commit to net zero should pair their investments in carbon removal efforts, such as reforestation, with changes to their operations that will reduce actual emissions.
Salesforce, for example, is supporting the conservation, restoration and growth of 100 million trees by 2030, while prioritizing emissions reductions and reaching 100% renewable energy for its global operations last year. For any emissions that remain after that, Salesforce is using carbon credits to have net zero residual emissions today. And PepsiCo is adopting more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and shifting to renewable electricity, while also investing in natural climate solutions such as forest conservation and restoration.
Invest in innovation
Companies can go beyond just paying for tree seedlings to help deliver forest-climate solutions with rigor and innovation. They should look at ways they can contribute from their unique areas of expertise. Technology companies, for instance, can donate products and pro-bono services to help partner organizations better utilize forest and climate data. Companies should also use their direct financial contributions to help partners with fewer resources develop and execute projects. This includes partner expenses for things like designing climate-resilient plantings and training workers to implement these cutting-edge forestry approaches.

We welcome the ongoing debate about the best way to achieve our climate goals. But as we move forward, let’s not dismiss climate solutions – including natural ones, like trees. That’s how we can sustain the climate momentum we have worked for so many decades to build, engage more people and communities in this urgent work and spare the world the worst effects of climate change. That can’t be just the work of governments and environmentalists. It has to be the business of business."
Kerry: Formal climate talks between US and China have resumed at UN summit,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/world/us-china-climate-talks-kerry-cop27/index.html,"Kerry: Formal climate talks between US and China have resumed at UN summit
US climate envoy John Kerry confirmed to CNN that formal climate talks with China have restarted at the UN’s COP27 summit in Egypt, lifting a months-long freeze on negotiations and showing an early sign of concrete results from a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Bali earlier this week.
Asked to confirm whether formal talks between the US and China have resumed, Kerry said: “Yes, we are talking.”
The nations are the world’s two biggest polluters and their cooperation is crucial if the world is to avert catastrophic climate change. When Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, announced that their countries would work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the COP26 summit in Glasgow last year, it was a rare piece of good news in the otherwise very gloomy climate space.
But the cooperation abruptly ended in August when China suspended the talks in response to US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.
In talks with Xi at the G20 summit in Bali on Monday, Biden underscored the importance of the world’s two largest emitters continuing to work on climate and lowering emissions, among other issues. The leaders “agreed to empower key senior officials to maintain communication and deepen constructive efforts on these and other issues,” a White House readout of the meeting said.
The Biden administration is waiting to see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, a US official previously told CNN.
A statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the “two countries will jointly work for the success of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.”
Kerry and Xie have been meeting on the sidelines of the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh this week and last, but the exchanges had been informal and not part of the formal climate talks. Kerry told CNN last week that his hope coming into Egypt was to restart the formal conversation.
“Our hope is that with a short span of time, it will become possible for us to really get together again in full measure and do the things we need to be doing as the two leading emitters in the world and as the two largest economies in the world,” he said.
“China and the United States really need to cooperate on this. And without China, even if the US is as we are moving towards a 1.5-degree program, which we are if we don’t have China, nobody else can make to that goal.”

Rich countries are trying to hit pause on climate summit’s key issue,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/world/cop27-loss-and-damage-negotiations-climate-intl/index.html,"Rich countries are trying to hit pause on climate summit’s key issue
The past week has given the world a glimpse of what climate-vulnerable countries have long known: while rich countries bend over backwards to pledge their support for climate action, they are far less enthusiastic when it comes to forking over the cash.
At the UN’s COP27 climate summit, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom are united against establishing a new fund this year to help the world’s developing nations – which have contributed little to the climate crisis – recover from climate disasters.
Developing a so-called loss and damage fund is a key issue at COP27, and “the litmus test for success” of the summit, said Erin Roberts, a climate policy researcher and founder of the Loss and Damage Collaboration.
As it stands, developing countries – which have for years pleaded for loss and damage funds – are facing disappointment.
With only three days of negotiations left, a sense of frustration is spreading through the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh where the conference is taking place. Activists are staging daily and increasingly angry protests outside the negotiation rooms. On Saturday, in what was the biggest protest of the summit so far, hundreds marched through the sprawling conference venue, demanding rich countries to get their act together and “pay up.”
But that message is not breaking through in high-level negotiations.
An EU source directly involved in the negotiations at the summit told CNN on Tuesday that the bloc doesn’t believe there should be a binding agreement on a new loss and damage fund before the details of how it would work are agreed on.
The source added that the EU believes the COP27 agreement could include an agreement that work needs to be done on the issue and a solution should be found by 2024.
Similarly, the UK government submitted a document to the conference saying it wants to establish a “process” that would lead to a concrete solution in 2024 at the latest.
US senior administration officials have only committed to having a conversation about loss and damage but have not gone further to explain what kind of fund they would ultimately support. They, too, see 2024 as the deadline for an agreement on loss and damage, but do not support the proposals put forward so far, concerned it could open up developed nations to legal liability in the coming years.
Pressed on what kind of loss and damage fund the US would be open to, officials have repeatedly declined to say. And they want to take the next two years to hammer those questions out, rather than come to an agreement this year.
A spokesperson for US climate envoy John Kerry did not respond to a request for comment.
The push for delay by some of the world’s richest countries means those that are worst impacted by climate change are already bracing for disappointment.
“I don’t want to leave COP27 empty handed,” Shauna Aminath, the Maldives’ minister of environment said an event at the conference on Tuesday. “Agreeing to work on something that will be established in 2024 is leaving empty handed.”
A contentious issue comes to a head
It was seen as a huge success that loss and damage made it onto the formal agenda for COP27, and developing nations are holding wealthy countries’ feet to the fire and pushing for a binding commitment this year.
Negotiations on the issue have been packed, summit-goers have told CNN, and have dragged late into the evenings this week.
But developed countries are slow-walking the issue – many want to take the next two years to explore possible solutions, with a proposal to make a decision by 2024, which doesn’t guarantee an official funding arrangement.
Amid a tough economy, US and EU leaders worry they won’t be able to get this funding passed through legislatures at home, where they’re already facing an uphill battle to marshal more money to fulfill climate finance commitments.
But Aminath said she doesn’t believe the reluctance to address loss and damage comes down to lack of finance.
“We saw that trillions were mobilized to address the global health emergency” during the pandemic, she said, and “we are seeing trillions being spent to help Ukraine.”
Representatives from vulnerable countries also told CNN they’re frustrated by wealthy nations’ calls for more analysis and mapping, which would cost money that could otherwise go to addressing loss and damage.
“They wanted to show their electorates that they are doing something when in fact they’re not,” Michai Robertson, loss and damage finance lead with the Alliance of Small Island States, told CNN. “They’re putting money into, for example, research departments, as opposed to actually putting funding for specific responses to all the loss and damage that we face.”
Despite the grim outlook so far, Robertson said developing countries remain united and determined, noting that the last thing they want is to be stuck in another cycle of climate disasters, more debt and devastation, with no action from developed countries.
“We don’t want just an opportunity to survive; we want opportunity to thrive,” he said.
Solutions in the meantime
A hopeful moment for loss and damage came earlier this week when Germany announced a Global Shield initiative designed to help vulnerable countries deal with the loss and damage caused by the climate crisis.
Flood-ravaged countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines will be among the countries to benefit from it when the program starts paying out funding early next year.
While the funds committed to the initiative were comparatively large, they still pale in comparison to the devastation these countries have endured.
For instance, the World Bank estimated last month that Pakistan would need “at least $16.3 billion” for reconstruction after this summer’s deadly floods. As of Monday, Global Shield had received total commitments of roughly $216 million.
The program has also been criticized because of its underlying focus on insurance and preventing future loss and damage, rather than direct funding to address the disasters that have already – and recently – occurred.
German Federal Development Minister Svenja Schulze stressed the initiative was in addition to — not a replacement of — an official UN loss and damage fund.
“That was a good start, but it is also just a start,” Schulze said at a Monday news conference, stressing that loss and damage was “a highly contentious issue.”
“I am glad that we, the international community have finally come to say yes, there is climate-related loss and damage,” Schulze said.
Julie-Anne Richards, an independent consultant and expert with the Loss and Damage Collaboration, said the Global Shield design is problematic.
“They’re facing all these climate risks because rich countries like Australia and the US caused the climate problem, yet now they’re outsourcing dealing with it to vulnerable people, saying ‘it’s your responsibility to take out insurance,’” Richards told CNN.
Richards said she worries that countries are spending more time, effort and money creating a system that might not be able to scale to the problem the planet is facing. Vulnerable countries are already watching their islands sink into the ocean, food and water supply dwindle rapidly from drought and homes inundated with floods.
“The loss and damage finance facility needs to be set up in such a way that it provides grants, it doesn’t lead to more debt, and doesn’t shift responsibility onto vulnerable countries,” Richards said. “So we need new money because of the scale of the problem. The climate impacts that we’re facing are significant, and it needs significant finance.”"
"As rich nations haggle over climate solutions, storm-ravaged Caribbean is taking matters into its own hands",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/world/caribbean-solar-power-microgrids-climate-cop27/index.html,"As rich nations haggle over climate solutions, storm-ravaged Caribbean is taking matters into its own hands
When Hurricane Fiona slammed into Puerto Rico in September, it triggered a nearly island-wide blackout as the storm’s strong winds took down the fragile power grid.
Carlos Ramos spoke to CNN as he helped his friends clean up their flood-damaged beach home in Salinas. Ramos said most of his neighbors in Aguas Buenas, in the island’s central mountain range, were among those who lost power in the wake of the hurricane.
But Ramos’s home maintained power.
Frustrated by the rising cost of electricity and the ever-looming threat of power outages on the storm-stricken island, the 59-year-old retired bank worker had solar panels installed on his home.
“All my neighbors said I was crazy for getting the solar panels,” he told CNN. “Now they’re sitting in the dark. It was the best investment.”
World leaders are in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this week for the UN’s COP27 climate summit where they are negotiating solutions to the climate crisis and haggling over how to help developing nations switch to clean energy and pay for extreme weather disasters.
But as they do so, millions of people are already dealing with the impacts.
Among the regions that have long endured these devastating impacts are the Caribbean islands, where sea level is rising and hurricanes are becoming more intense.
But Caribbean leaders, residents and even utility companies say they are tired of waiting for world leaders to save them. Experts and residents tell CNN that the islands are now eagerly adapting on their own through grant funding, phasing out fossil fuels and advancing clean energy across the region, to make them better prepared for the worsening impacts of the climate crisis.
“We don’t have the luxury of being able to sit by and wait until the planet comes to an agreement,” Racquel Moses, CEO of the Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator, told CNN. “We have been waiting, and we have been trying to do the best that we can with the resources that we have. But we are not seeing enough momentum and we keep sustaining losses.”
Microgrids keep the lights on
Last year, the Bahamas successfully developed a solar-powered microgrid that provides renewable energy to every home on Ragged Island – a small island community which was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The Category 5 tore through the Caribbean in 2017, displaced thousands of people and leveled electric grids.
The Ragged Island electric project was designed so that the next time a storm hits and takes down the power system, the 390-kilowatt microgrid can disconnect from the main grid and keep the lights on for residents.
That project’s success created a ripple effect across the Bahamas, said David Gumbs, director of the Islands Energy Program at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a non-profit group that’s working to scale up clean energy programs to curtail global emissions. The country has now deployed even more microgrids to other islands, totaling nearly 6.5 megawatts of renewable power across the country — which is enough to power around 300 Caribbean houses.
“The project is definitely a success,” Gumbs told CNN. “We’re in the phase of transition. There are now a number of islands that are champions in big initiatives.”
Moses said 2017’s back-to-back hurricanes — first Irma, then Maria — was the turning point for the Caribbean, where residents and government leaders said they could no longer afford to wait and “be sitting ducks, hoping” that wealthy countries would rescue them from the climate crisis, or halt its acceleration.
“We are already under threat,” Moses said. “You’ve just seen Hurricane Fiona and what it’s done, not only to islands in the Caribbean, but also in the US – the most powerful economy on the planet – and yet responding to billions of dollars’ worth of damages is going to be problematic.”
The Caribbean islands contribute a tiny fraction to the climate crisis — less than 2% of planet-warming emissions, Moses said — yet they are on the frontlines when it comes to climate disasters.
And on top of the flooding, fallen trees, battered roads and broken infrastructure, soaring utility prices have become unaffordable, Gumbs said.
“When you’re paying four times as much for electricity, and your income is four times less than the average income in the US, it just creates such a hardship for people,” he said. “And those are the people we are worried about getting left behind.”
Future-proofing the Caribbean
Gumbs experienced the wrath of Irma himself in his home island of Anguilla, where at the time he was the CEO of the island’s utility company. Now with RMI, he has been overseeing this energy transition across the Caribbean region, redesigning the electricity grid to be free of fossil fuels and climate-resilient.
“There’s such an enormous opportunity,” Gumbs said. “We would love for it to happen at scale, to just transform the entire system to renewables tomorrow, but there are certain barriers to do that.”
At COP27, money is the biggest debate. Developing nations are putting more pressure on the world’s richest countries to help them recover from climate disasters. Negotiators will also discuss the existing promise of climate finance meant to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy – a $100 billion-a-year pledge that rich countries have yet to make good on.
But even then, Gumbs said it’s hard for low-income countries “tap into” those funds: “It just takes years to get the money out,” he said. “It’s always a problem, but there are a number of ways to overcome that.”
On Tuesday, RMI and investment fund Lion’s Head Global Partners launched a new Caribbean Climate-Smart Fund to accelerate that clean energy shift. The initiative intends to expand the islands’ access to resilient clean energy, which advocates say would help Caribbean nations not only adapt to a warmer future, but also save millions each year in utility costs.
Gumbs said the fund will comprise more than $150 million of philanthropic money and will be spread across more than 20 Caribbean islands.
Charlin Bodley, the global south manager for RMI, said wealthy countries must look beyond reducing their climate emissions – which she said is the “easy part” – and consider how they will support small island nations suffering the consequences of their fossil fuel use.
“There is a level of support that is necessary,” Bodley, who is based in St. Lucia, told CNN. “It’s really, at this point, a matter of survival for Caribbean.”
And because the Caribbean islands see clean energy as a solution to withstand disasters but also to save on electricity costs, Moses said the momentum and political interest across the region is growing, and island governments are turning to groups like RMI and other nonprofits for grant funding to pursue their clean energy goals.
But Gumbs said they still need more clean energy programs, educational resources for residents, as well as access to funds from grant-making entities. To him, the solutions are ready. He said the Caribbean might just be the model that would convince both wealthy nations and the private sector to invest in solutions through climate finance.
“Climate-smart funds provide a vehicle to eliminate a big part of the problem,” Gumbs said. “It’s important to bring people along with these solutions, and we’re going to do it in a way that’s sensitive to the local environment.”

Uganda’s President Museveni slams ‘Western double standards’ over coal mine plans,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/africa/western-hypocrisy-climate-change-intl/index.html,"Uganda’s President Museveni slams ‘Western double standards’ over coal mine plans
Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has slammed Western countries over what he calls a “reprehensible double standard” in their response to the energy crisis brought about by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In a Twitter post on Sunday, Museveni singled out Germany for demolishing wind turbines to allow for the expansion of a coal-fueled power plant as Europe battles an energy crisis triggered by the Russia/Ukraine war.
In September, Russia which had come under a raft of Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, halted gas supplies to Europe, leaving the region that was dependent on Russian oil and gas imports scampering for alternatives.
Germany had proposed phasing out coal-fired power plants by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions. But Europe’s largest economy has now been forced to prioritize energy security over clean energy as gas supplies from Russia froze. Just like Germany, many other European countries are reviving coal projects as alternatives to Russian energy.
Making ‘a mockery’ of climate targets
Museveni, 78, says Europe’s switch to coal-based power generation “makes a mockery” of the West’s climate targets.
“News from Europe that a vast wind farm is being demolished to make way for a new open-pit coal mine is the reprehensible double standard we in Africa have come to expect. It makes a mockery of Western commitments to climate targets,” the Ugandan leader said, while further describing the move as “the purest hypocrisy.”
CNN has contacted the German Embassy in Uganda for comment.
In a statement released on his official website, Museveni stated that “Europe’s failure to meet its climate goals should not be Africa’s problem.”
The African continent has remained the most vulnerable to climate change despite having the lowest emissions and contributing the least to global warming. While wealthy nations (who are the largest emission producers) are better equipped to manage the impacts of climate change, poorer countries like those in Africa are not.
“We will not accept one rule for them and another rule for us,” said Museveni, who has ruled the east African nation for 36 years.
Bearing the brunt of climate change
Uganda aims to explore its oil reserves at a commercial level in the next three years but a resolution by the European Union parliament in September warned that the project will displace thousands, jeopardize water resources and endanger protected marine areas.
Museveni reacted to the resolution at the time, insisting that “the project shall proceed,” and threatened to find new contractors if the current handlers of the oil project “choose to listen to the EU Parliament.”
African leaders have continued to push richer nations for climate adaptation funding at the ongoing COP27 climate summit in Egypt, as many parts of the continent grapple with severe drought, flooding, and other catastrophic effects of climate change.
Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera, who is attending the COP27 summit, said his country and other poorer nations “continue to carry the weight of carbon emissions from biggest polluters elsewhere.”
Chakwera said he lobbied in Egypt for more climate funding from wealthier nations, adding: “Despite our marginal contribution to global warming, we continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate change impacts, with 10% of our economic losses being occasioned by disasters.”
A pledge by developed countries to pay $100 billion every year from 2020 to help the developing world switch from fossil fuels to clean energy has yet to be fulfilled."
Coast-to-coast cold as US plunges into winter this week,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/weather/arctic-air-winter-cold-snow-wxn/index.html,"Coast-to-coast cold as US plunges into winter this week
Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.
Despite the calendar saying it’s mid-November, winter has arrived across the Lower 48 and could stick around through Thanksgiving next week.
This week, snow flurries and an arctic chill are in the air for millions across the nation. A low-pressure system across the Southwest will sweep across the central Plains today, bringing with it rain and snow showers.
It will be the first notable winter weather event of the season for most in the region, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
“While uncertainty remains regarding the location of the heaviest axis of snow, the potential exists for snowfall totals of 3 to 6 inches across west-central Oklahoma,” the prediction center said. “Light snow totals are also possible across southern Kansas and the Texas panhandle.”
Winter weather alerts are in place across the region, including Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Wichita in Kansas, Amarillo in Texas, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. The falling snow will lead to reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions today.
The system will push east this week and with well-below-normal temperatures already in place. Ice, sleet, and snow showers are possible across the Midwest and into interior parts of the Northeast Tuesday and Wednesday.
Coastal areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are currently forecast to see a cold rain, as temperatures are expected to remain just above freezing.
If you haven’t already, you may want to pull out your winter coats and sweaters. More than 225 million people across the Lower 48 will experience temperatures at or below freezing this week, which is about 70 percent of the US population.
The cold temperatures are already in place with readings running 10 to 20 degrees below normal for many, highs below freezing across the northern Plains and upper Midwest, and highs only in the 50s across the South.
The Central Plains are seeing the coldest temperatures compared to average with highs 25 to 30 degrees below normal today.
Only Florida is escaping the early winter chill, but even the Sunshine State will get in on the cooler air later this week.
By Thursday, another bout of arctic air will surge south from Montana into the central Plains and Midwest by Friday, reinforcing cold temperatures of 25 to 35 degrees below normal.
If the cold air helps you get into the holiday spirit, you are in luck! This arctic air is expected to stick around for much of the nation through Thanksgiving week. The bull’s-eye of the arctic air next week will stretch across the Great Lakes, south to the Tennessee River Valley.
We will have more details on how cold your Thanksgiving week could be and any travel hazards to be prepared for in next Monday’s Weather Brief.
In the meantime, now that cold and wintry weather has begun, we wanted to share with you a few weather terms you are likely to hear a lot about this season. And it might give you a little something to impress your friends with your weather knowledge.
Polar Vortex
It is not a new term, but the polar vortex is always present and always has been.
It’s a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the Earth’s North and South poles and is located tens of thousands of feet into the atmosphere. This counterclockwise flow of air helps keep the very cold air near the poles.

What is a polar vortex?
“Many times, during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the polar vortex will expand, sending cold air southward with the jet stream,” the National Weather Service explained. “This occurs fairly regularly during wintertime and is often associated with large outbreaks of Arctic air in the United States.”
February 2021 was a classic example of the polar vortex weakening, sending a surge of Arctic air very far south. One week in February, every state in the US experienced temperatures below freezing.
Sometimes the cold air will dive down and meet warm, moist air traveling north from the Gulf and Atlantic, and you end up with a Nor’easter.
Read more about the Polar vortex.
Nor’easter
If you are one of our friends in the Northeast, you are no stranger to nor’easters, which are storms which travel north along the East Coast. It gets its name because winds over coastal areas are generally out of the northeast.

What is a nor'easter?
“They nearly always bring precipitation in the form of heavy rain or snow, as well as winds of gale force, rough seas, and, occasionally, coastal flooding to the affected regions,” the weather service noted. “The heavily populated region between Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, the ‘I-95 Corridor,’ is especially impacted by nor’easters.”
Nor’easters can cripple this region of the country by snarling traffic, bringing flights to a halt and sometimes resulting in power outages.
If the nor’easter strengthens rapidly, we can end up with a bomb cyclone.
Watch as our very own Meteorologist Jennifer Gray explains more about a nor’easter.
Bomb Cyclone
A bomb cyclone is a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) in 24 hours. It’s as simple as that. Nothing explodes, but they can be dangerous.

Just what exactly is a 'bomb cyclone'?
We have seen bomb cyclones affect the Northeast as well as West Coast with hurricane-like furry.
Just last year, this West Coast bomb cyclone brought hurricane-force winds, 20-foot seas, rain and snow to a huge chunk of the West.
Our Meteorologist Brandon Miller explains what you need to know about these bomb cyclones.
Winter weather is interesting, no matter how you categorize it. But if Mother Nature throws a punch during the winter, you might be lucky enough to hear thundersnow!
Thundersnow
While winter thunderstorms are far less common than summer thunderstorms, they can occur.
“Thundersnow occurs where there is relatively strong instability and abundant moisture above the surface of the Earth, such as above a warm front,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. “The ingredients that create thundersnow are similar to the dynamics of a typical thunderstorm – moisture, instability, and a lifting mechanism.”
Related video
This is what thundersnow sounds like
We’ve heard thundersnow several times while covering big snow events, and it sounds different from summertime thunder. The heavy snowfall can muffle the sound of the thunder, making it sound more like a slow rumble and not as booming.
And yes, thundersnow does indicate lightning is in your proximity, so treat it the same as you would a thunderstorm and seek shelter."

Negative emissions. Carbon capture. Net zero.
It can be daunting, and a little exhausting, keeping up with the terminology from the annual UN climate talks, known as COP27, which are taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.
But CNN’s coverage can help you understand what’s at stake, what action needs to be taken and demystify the technical lingo.
Plus, we take a deeper look at an overlooked driver of climate crisis: the thawing permafrost.
Mission critical
I first became interested in permafrost — the layer of frozen ground beneath the Arctic tundra and high-latitude boreal forests — two years ago when reporting about mysterious holes that had suddenly appeared in remote parts of Siberia.
The craters are perhaps the most extreme example of the dramatic changes happening in the northernmost reaches of the planet as polar regions warm four times faster than the global average.
Permafrost is a particularly unpredictable wild card in the climate crisis. The carbon-storing frozen earth may already be emitting as much greenhouse gas as a country with a large carbon footprint, such as Japan.
Scientists particularly fear “abrupt thaw” that is exposing deeper layers of permafrost and has the power to shock the landscape into releasing more carbon.
Going green
Many are doing their best to minimize a personal role in climate change. But how about going green in death?
Recompose, the first human composting company in the United States, has converted more than 200 corpses into soil and has more than 1,100 people signed up for its prearrangement program.
Demand is likely to grow: California just became the fifth US state to sign a human composting bill into law, and others are considering similar legislation.
Advocates hope it can help slow the climate crisis, with cremations requiring lots of fuel. Carbon emissions from cremating one corpse is the equivalent of driving 470 miles (756 kilometers) in a car, according to one estimate. However, the industry is still new, and there is little research on how much better human composting is for the environment compared with traditional burials.

Explorations
Denmark is home to what’s thought to be the world’s largest collection of brains — a cache of 9,479 of them. It’s a valuable resource for brain research on conditions such as dementia and depression, but one with a dark and controversial history.
The brains belonged to psychiatric patients in Denmark who died between 1945 and 1982 and did not consent to the organ donation. One of the specimens belonged to Kirsten Abildtrup, the great-aunt of journalist Lise Søgaard. Søgaard remembers a picture of Kirsten as a little girl on her grandmother’s wall. No one ever spoke about the child in the photo.
In a quest to understand what happened to her great-aunt, Søgaard discovered her relative’s brain in the collection, now housed in a basement at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. Kirsten had died at age 24 while being treated for schizophrenia after having a lobotomy a year earlier.
By sharing her family’s story last year in a Danish newspaper, Søgaard has sought to break some of the stigma surrounding mental illness.
Ocean secrets
An expedition to the wreck of the Titanic has led to a surprising discovery.
Divers encountered a rocky reef, made up of volcanic formations, and teeming with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.
The location was earmarked for investigation after Titanic diver P.H. Nargeolet detected a sonar blip in 1996. The veteran submersible pilot initially had thought the anomaly, picked up on echo sounding equipment, might be another shipwreck.
Meanwhile, explorers searching in the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts uncovered debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff in 1986.
Dig this
The oldest known sentence written in an alphabet has been found in an unexpected place — a lice comb.
The 3,700-year-old ivory comb was unearthed in 2016 during a dig at an Israeli archaeological site called Lachish, but an inscription on the comb wasn’t discovered until five years later. A smartphone snapshot revealed 17 letters that form seven words in Canaanite — the first known alphabet and the source of the one we use to write the English language in today.
The comb is a wonderfully human portal into the past, and the inscription captures a sentiment familiar to anyone unlucky enough to have encountered the pesky critters.
The wonder

— An exciting medical breakthrough could soon make a difference for people with rare blood types, sickle cell disease or those with certain genetic disorders.

"Belching lakes, mystery craters, ‘zombie fires’: How the climate crisis is transforming the Arctic permafrost",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/12/world/permafrost-climate-change-explainer-scn/index.html,"Belching lakes, mystery craters, ‘zombie fires’: How the climate crisis is transforming the Arctic permafrost
Four years ago, Morris J. Alexie had to move out of the house his father built in Alaska in 1969 because it was sinking into the ground and water was beginning to seep into his home.
“The bogs are showing up in between houses, all over our community. There are currently seven houses that are occupied but very slanted and sinking into the ground as we speak,” Alexie said by phone from Nunapitchuk, a village of around 600 people. “Everywhere is bogging up.”
What was once grassy tundra is now riddled with water, he said. Their land is crisscrossed by 8-foot-wide boardwalks the community uses to get from place to place. And even some of the boardwalks have begun to sink.
“It’s like little polka dots of tundra land. We used to have regular grass all over our community. Now it’s changed into constant water marsh.”
Thawing permafrost — the long-frozen layer of soil that has underpinned the Arctic tundra and boreal forests of Alaska, Canada and Russia for millennia — is upending the lives of people such as Alexie. It’s also dramatically transforming the polar landscape, which is now peppered with massive sinkholes, newly formed or drained lakes, collapsing seashores and fire damage.

Overlooked and underestimated
It’s not just the 3.6 million people who live in polar regions who need to be worried about the thawing permafrost.
Everyone does – particularly the leaders and climate policymakers from nearly 200 countries now meeting in Egypt for COP 27, the annual UN climate summit.
The vast amount of carbon stored in the northernmost reaches of our planet is an overlooked and underestimated driver of climate crisis. The frozen ground holds an estimated 1,700 billion metric tons of carbon –  roughly 51 times the amount of carbon the world released as fossil fuel emissions in 2019, according to NASA. It may already be emitting as much greenhouse gas as Japan.
Permafrost thaw gets less attention than the headline-hogging shrinking of glaciers and ice sheets, but scientists said that needs to change — and fast.
“Permafrost is like the dirty cousin to the ice sheets. It’s a buried phenomenon. You don’t see it. It’s covered by vegetation and soil,” said Merritt Turetsky, director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. “But it’s down there. We know it’s there. And it has an equally important impact on the global climate.”
It’s particularly pressing because Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stopped much scientific cooperation, meaning a potential loss of access to key data and knowledge about the region.
Warmer summers — the Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average — have weakened and deepened the top or active layer of permafrost, which unfreezes in summer and freezes in winter.
This thawing is waking up the microbes in the soil that feast on organic matter, allowing methane and carbon dioxide to escape from the soil and into the atmosphere. It can also open pathways for methane to rise up from reservoirs deep in the earth.
“Permafrost has been basically serving as Earth’s freezer for ancient biomass,” Turetsky said. “When those creatures and organisms died, their biomass became incorporated into these frozen soil layers and then was preserved over time.”
As permafrost thaws, often in complex ways that aren’t clearly understood, that freezer lid is cranking open, and scientists such as Turetsky are doubling efforts to understand how these changes will play out.

Climate wild card
Permafrost is a particularly unpredictable wild card in the climate crisis because it’s not yet clear whether carbon emissions from permafrost will be a relative drop in the bucket or a devastating addition. The latest estimates suggest that the magnitude of carbon emissions from permafrost by the end of this century could be equal to or bigger than present-day emissions from major fossil fuel-emitting nations.
“There’s some scientific uncertainty of how large that country is. However, if we go down a high emissions scenario, it could be as large or larger than the United States,” said Brendan Rogers, an associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts.
He described the permafrost as a sleeping giant whose impact wasn’t yet clear.
“We’re just talking about a massive amount of carbon. We don’t expect all of it to thaw … because some of it is very deep and would take hundreds or thousands of years,” Rogers said. “But even if a small fraction of that does get admitted to the atmosphere, that’s a big deal.”
Projections of cumulative permafrost carbon emissions from 2022 through 2100 range from 99 gigatons to 550 gigatons. By comparison, the United States currently emits 368 gigatons of carbon, according to a paper published in September in the journal Environmental Research Letters.
‘Abrupt thaw’
Not all climate change models that policymakers use to make their already grim predictions include projected emissions from permafrost thaw, and those that do assume it will be gradual, Rogers said.
He and other scientists are concerned about the prevalence of abrupt or rapid thawing in permafrost regions, which has the power to shock the landscape into releasing far more carbon than with gradual top-down warming alone.
The traditional view of permafrost thaw is that it’s a process that exposes layers slowly, but “abrupt thaw” is exposing deep permafrost layers more quickly in a number of ways.
For example, Big Trail Lake in Alaska, a recently formed lake, belches bubbles of methane — a potent greenhouse gas, which comes from thawing permafrost below the lake water. The methane can stop such lakes from refreezing in winter, exposing the deeper permafrost to warmer temperatures and degradation.
Rapid thawing of the permafrost also happens in the wake of intense wildfires that have swept across parts of Siberia in recent years, Rogers said. Sometimes these blazes smolder underground for months, long after flames above ground have been extinguished, earning them the nickname zombie fires.
“The fires themselves will burn part of the active layer (of permafrost) combusting the soil and releasing greenhouses gases like carbon dioxide,” Rogers said. “But that soil that’s been combusted was also insulating, keeping the permafrost cool in summer. Once you get rid of it, you get very quickly much deeper active layers, and that can lead to larger emissions over the following decades.”
Also deeply concerning has been the sudden appearance of around 20 perfectly cylindrical craters in the remote far north of Siberia in the past 10 years. Dozens of meters in diameter, they are thought to be caused by a buildup and explosion of methane — a previously unknown geological phenomenon that surprised many permafrost scientists and could represent a new pathway for methane previously contained deep within the earth to escape.
“The Arctic is warming so fast,” Rogers said, “and there’s crazy things happening.”

War a ‘disaster for our scientific enterprise’
A lack of monitoring and data on the behavior of permafrost, which covers 15% of the exposed land surface of the Northern Hemisphere, means scientists still only have a patchwork, localized understanding of rapid thaw, how it contributes to global warming and affects people living in permafrost regions.
Rogers at the Woodwell Climate Research Center is part of a new $41 million initiative, funded by a group of  billionaires and called the Audacious Project, to understand permafrost thaw. It aims to coordinate a pan-Arctic carbon monitoring network to fill in some of the data gaps that have made it difficult to incorporate permafrost thaw emissions into climate targets.
The project’s first carbon flux tower, which tracks the flow of methane and carbon dioxide from the ground to the atmosphere, was installed this summer in Churchill, Manitoba. However, plans to install similar monitoring stations in Siberia are in disarray as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“It’s always been more challenging to work in Russia than other countries … Canada, for example,” Rogers said. “But this (invasion), of course, has made it exponentially more challenging.”
Sebastian Dötterl, a professor and soil scientist at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, who studies how warmer air and soil temperatures change plant growth in the Arctic, was able to travel to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic this summer to collect soil and plant samples.
However, the field trip cost twice as much as initially budgeted because the group was forbidden to use any Russia-owned infrastructure, forcing the team to hire a tourist boat and reorganize its itinerary. But Dötterl said the more pressing issue is that he can no longer interact with his counterparts at Russian institutions.
“We are now splitting a rather small community of specialists all over the world into political groups that are disconnected, where our problems are global and should be connected,” he said.
Turetsky agreed, saying that the war in Ukraine had been a “disaster for our scientific enterprise.”
“Russia and Siberia are huge, huge players. … Many of the (European Union-) and US-funded projects to work in Siberia to do any kind of lateral knowledge sharing, they’ve all been canceled.
“Will we stop trying? No, of course not. And there’s a lot we can do with existing data and with global remote sensing products. But it’s been a real setback for the community.”

Biden celebrated a major victory on climate this year. But this issue could prove insurmountable,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/biden-global-climate-finance-congress/index.html,"Biden celebrated a major victory on climate this year. But this issue could prove insurmountable
President Joe Biden arrives Friday at the UN’s COP27 summit in Egypt with a climate change victory in-hand: a massive US law passed this year that experts have told CNN will go far to help transition the country to renewable energy.
Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act contained $370 billion for climate and clean energy tax credits and new programs – the largest climate-related investment in the country’s history and a significant statement that the US is back in the clean-energy race.
But that law left out an important thing: international climate finance – funds to help poorer countries adapt to the climate crisis and grow their economies without becoming dependent on fossil fuel.
Last year, Biden pledged to contribute $11.4 billion per year to that fund, something he hoped would go a long way in helping developed nations meet the $100 billion a year they pledged to raise by 2020 and have thus far fallen short on.
Whether Biden can marshal that much funding is unclear; while senators attending COP27 told CNN they expect Congress to pass a government spending bill by the end of this year, it remains to be seen whether Biden’s full international goal will be approved.
“We would like, as Democrats, to get a lot of support for the international Green Fund or other means of providing support to transitioning economies into this bill,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. “The obstacle is Republican opposition, and the Republican opposition is driven by the fossil fuel industry.”
Democratic majorities in the US Senate are already razor thin, meaning Republicans will have significant input on appropriations. And all are watching to see whether the balance of power in Congress could change after a competitive midterm election.
“The politics in Washington is always challenging on any appropriations bill,” Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland told CNN. “I hope the House is controlled by Democrats, but it’s still going to be challenging to make funds available – we recognize that.”
A senior administration official said that while a new budget bill could pass before a new Congress takes control in January, the potentially shifting politics around the midterms puts big question mark how control of Congress could impact US climate finance in the coming years.
The US has also shied away from calls for the richest nations to create a so-called “loss and damage” fund, which would help developing countries that are most impacted by the climate crisis – yet have had little hand in creating the problem – to recover after climate disasters. The US has thus far pledged no money to the effort, though Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, has said he is committed to talking about a potential fund at COP27.
Kerry told reporters before the summit that “it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”
Even if the US is able to walk the talk this year on its domestic climate goals, it will still face questions about whether it can actually meet its global finance commitments, experts said.
“It’s not just about the U.S. and other developed nations reducing emissions. It’s also about what the U.S. does for developing countries to help them along,” said Barry Rabe, Professor of Environmental Policy at University of Michigan. “It becomes a huge challenge for Biden to explain how [the IRA legislation] will benefit other countries.”
Past deadline
One way the US might be able to meet its goals is by leveraging the buying power of the private sector. On Wednesday, Kerry announced a controversial plan to raise cash for climate action by selling carbon credits to companies wishing to offset their polluting emissions.
That plan was met with criticism because of the way it will be financed: carbon credits, which allow companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own.
But Kerry stressed to CNN on Thursday that “that it is one of the few ways that we have” to generate the huge amount of money needed to fund the global clean energy transition.
“We desperately need money,” Kerry told CNN. “It takes trillions and no government that I know of is ready to put trillions into this on an annual basis.”
The US is not alone in developed countries that have struggled to meet their climate commitments. The United Kingdom has so far failed to deliver more than $300 million it promised last year in international climate finance, a year after that government hosted COP26.
A recent report from the governments of Canada, Germany, and the UK released ahead of COP27 found that overall, the world’s 39 richest countries are failing to meet the annual $100-billion pledge they announced in 2009. But the report noted that there has been some progress, and they are expected to meet it by next year.
In 2020, nations raised $83.3 billion toward the goal, according to a separate report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released earlier this year.
The new date nations have outlined to meet their $100 billion goal is 2023, which climate officials from Germany, Canada and the UK insisted would be met.
“Developed countries remain committed to the trajectory on the $100 billion and beyond that was set out in last year’s delivery plan – we do remain on track for delivery in 2023,” COP26 president Alok Sharma told reporters recently.
But Sharma and other climate officials acknowledged a lack of trust from developing nations about whether developed nations would indeed meet their commitments given the years of delay.
“It does very much remain the case that developed countries and indeed the whole of the global financial system, need to be doing even more and faster, to support developing nations,” Sharma said. “Ultimately this is all about rebuilding and retaining trust in the system.”
Even though developed nations have been shirking their climate finance commitments for years, the scale of need is growing as global temperatures rise. The UK, Canada and Germany report developed countries and the private sector should increase their financial commitments even more after 2025, with the private sector taking on a larger role as well.
“What this year’s progress report shows is that we’re making progress in some areas, but there are still some challenges that remain,” Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said. “How can developing countries trust we can mobilize more money post-2025?”"

Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a CNN contributor, climate journalist and independent filmmaker whose work has won the Livingston Award, the IRE Award and others. He recently was appointed the Ted Turner Professor of Environmental Media at The George Washington University.
Sometimes it’s helpful to state the obvious truth. And then restate it, again and again.
That’s one of the benefits of the National Climate Assessment, a new draft of which was released this week ahead of President Joe Biden’s trip to the UN’s climate summit in Egypt.
The federal report paints a dire picture of what life is now like in America amid the climate crisis, and the incredible changes in store in the future. And it outlines some painful truths about global warming we must confront, but so far have not.
The COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, along with recent advances in US climate policy, may give the impression the world is doing something about an existential crisis, and we’re taking it seriously. The truth is, global emissions continue to rise, and will continue to do so for at least the next several years, even as scientists warn fossil fuel use must be slashed immediately.
In the meantime, the report’s authors write, “the things Americans value most are at risk.”
The National Climate Assessment, which is a congressionally-mandated report the federal government releases every four or five years, summarizes all the latest science and research on climate change in the United States. The new draft, which will go through a long period of public review before it is officially published next year, provides vital context about the very real pain the climate crisis is causing in the United States today, and how far we are from creating a world safe for future generations.
It is both familiar – as we have lived with these impacts for years now – and devastating to see it laid out in such stark synthesis.
Here are the report’s key takeaways:
The US is warming faster than the global average
The world already has warmed a little more than 1 degree Celsius, according to the report, with the US warming faster than the global average.
The goal of the Paris Agreement — which is being discussed this week in Egypt — is to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or at most to 2 degrees Celsius. To do it, the US needs to reach “net-zero” carbon emissions by about 2050, which will require a total clean energy transformation, and will likely require technology to suck our previous planet-warming emissions back out of the atmosphere.
For the United States to reach net-zero by 2050, the country’s emissions need to fall by a whopping 6% per year. US emissions fell just 12% over the course of nearly two decades between 2007 and 2019.
Climate disasters are getting worse
The impacts of the climate crisis are already being felt throughout the United States today, and they will continue to get more intense as long as planet-warming emissions rise, which is code for as long as we’re burning fossil fuels for heat and electricity, and chopping down forests.
“Many extremes, including heatwaves, heavy precipitation, drought, flooding, wildfire, and tropical cyclones/hurricanes, are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change,” the report’s authors write.
And the disasters are costly, both in terms of lives and dollars.
“In the 1980s, the country experienced on average one (inflation-adjusted) billion-dollar [extreme weather] event every four months,” the draft report states. “Now, there is one every three weeks, on average.”
It hits our most vulnerable the hardest
The climate crisis is creating a “cycle of worsening inequality,” one federal policies helped to create.
“The effects of climate change are felt most strongly by communities that are already overburdened, including Indigenous peoples, people of color, and low-income communities,” the report says.
“These frontline communities experience harmful climate impacts first and worst, yet are often the least responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change … Historical discriminatory policies such as redlining and displacement of Indigenous peoples forced communities of color into the least-valuable, often low-lying areas that are now more vulnerable to flooding, extreme heat, and air pollution from fossil fuel facilities and industry.”
The crisis threatens all the things we hold dear
The climate crisis cuts at the core of who we are as people.
“The things Americans value most are at risk,” the report says. “More intense extreme events and long-term climate changes make it harder to maintain safe homes and healthy families, reliable public services, a sustainable economy, thriving ecosystems, and strong communities. Many of the harmful impacts that people across the country are already experiencing will worsen as warming increases, and new risks will emerge.”
It’s exacerbating the water crisis
The rampant burning of fossil fuels is contributing to a worsening US water crisis. The report lays out how droughts will continue to become more intense and more frequent, “most notably in the Southwest.”
“Between 1980 and 2021, drought and related heatwaves across the country caused $291.1 billion (in 2021 dollars) in damages,” the report notes. “Recent droughts have strained surface and groundwater supplies, reduced agricultural productivity, and lowered water levels in major reservoirs, threatening hydropower generation.”
The report’s authors highlight the threat to the country’s aquifers — massive reservoirs of underground water built up over thousands of years — which are “particularly vulnerable to over-pumping.”
It’s playing a role in migration and economic woes
Climate change is bringing about a new era of forced migration, and “millions of people” are expected to be displaced in the United States.
Factors leading to future migration within the US include wildfires in California, rising seas in Florida and more frequent flooding in the South, according to the report.
The global economy is also in jeopardy. Global warming is expected to “reduce midcentury global economic output by 11% to 14%,” or about $23 trillion, according to the report.
Keep the hard facts in mind as you hear President Biden and other world leaders discussing climate action at the COP27 climate summit and beyond.
There is a 50-50 chance the world will at least temporarily hit 1.5 degrees in the next five years, according to a recent report by the World Meteorological Organization. To prevent it from happening, global leaders and private industry would need to move at the scale and intensity of the mobilization of resources for World War II, said Daniel Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment.
It doesn’t mean it’s OK to throw up our hands.
“It’s really important to realize that 1.5 (degrees of warming) was never safe and 2.2 (degrees) is not the end of the world,” Schrag said. “What I mean by that is there is no point where you throw up your hands and say, ‘Oh, we lost!’ … It’s never time to give up.”"

US climate envoy John Kerry on Thursday defended his plan to raise cash for climate action by selling carbon emission offsets to companies, telling CNN there was “not enough money in any country in the world to actually solve this problem.”
Speaking to CNN at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Kerry said the world cannot avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis without private money – because governments are not willing to pay what’s needed.
Kerry’s plan to finance the renewable energy transition in vulnerable countries by allowing companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own, raised concerns among climate experts. Many have warned that selling carbon credits could discourage companies from making real cuts to emissions.
But Kerry has made his view clear.
“We desperately need money,” Kerry told CNN. “It takes trillions and no government that I know of is ready to put trillions into this on an annual basis,” he added.
“I am absolutely convinced that it is one of the few ways that we have to be able to produce the amount of capital we need to accelerate this transition.”
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday that “shadow markets for carbon credits cannot undermine genuine emission reduction efforts.”
Kerry admitted that carbon trading can be problematic when there aren’t “sufficient rules or guardrails and you don’t have environmental integrity,” but said he wants to set up a system that would be tightly controlled.
“I met with the Secretary-General yesterday, and he was very clear he doesn’t object to all of them,” Kerry said, referring to carbon offset programs. “He objects to the ones that are ripping things off, but we talked about the tightest possible accountability, and I am absolutely convinced that it is one of the few ways that we have to be able to produce the amount of capital we need to accelerate this transition.”
The International Energy Agency said last month that governments must triple their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But it only expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade."
"Opinion: Where I come from, being a climate ‘activist’ isn’t a choice",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/opinions/amazon-climate-change-cop27-helena-gualinga/index.html,"Opinion: Where I come from, being a climate ‘activist’ isn’t a choice
This week, world leaders and diplomats are converging on the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El Sheikh for the 27th United Nations Climate Conference – better known as COP27.
Meanwhile, some 12,000 kilometers away from the sun-drenched beaches and high-level negotiations, another climate battle is already underway.
Among those attending COP27 is 20-year-old Helena Gualinga. She hails from a remote village in the Ecuadorian Amazon – home of the Kichwa Sarayaku community, who have been fighting for climate justice and indigenous land rights for decades.
And with historic results. In 2012, the Sarayaku community successfully took the Ecuadorian government to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, after it allowed oil exploration activities on their territory without their consent.
(Among the court’s findings was that Ecuador had put the Kichwa Sarayaku peoples’ right to life and cultural integrity in serious risk and was reportedly ordered to pay more than $1.3 million in compensation).
The landmark legal case had a lasting impact on Gualinga, and she hasn’t shied away from calling out the inadequacy of former COPs.
In response to the perceived failures of COP25, Gualinga co-founded Polluters Out, a global youth coalition challenging the UN and governments to cut ties with the fossil fuel industry.
Here, she tells CNN Opinion why she has reservations about COP27’s effectiveness, the importance of including indigenous people in climate crisis talks and why she doesn’t identify with the term “activist.”
The views expressed in this commentary are her own.
CNN: Describe growing up in the Ecuadorian Amazon and how this influenced your relationship with nature.
Gualinga: I spent a significant part of my childhood in my mother’s Sarayaku community in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where I have a big “ayllu” or “family.”
It was an upbringing both in nature and in coexistence with nature – a lifestyle and culture we carry with pride.
Here, we are surrounded by big Ceibo trees and beautiful waters. We live in huts made out of wood and palm leaves, built with ancestral practices. Our subsistence has solely depended on nature – but the climate crisis, extraction of resources and deforestation have all contributed to devastation of our territory, which impacts the wildlife and our communities.
All of this has influenced our philosophy and declaration – Kawsak Sacha, meaning “The Living Forest,” where everything is alive.
The forest, water and mountains are considered living beings and therefore to honor and protect these living beings, the Sarayaku is fighting for legal recognition of them to create a new category of conservation.
With traditional conservation methods increasingly being questioned, it’s clear that the world needs to look towards Indigenous people to learn how to protect our ecosystems.
CNN: The Sarayaku case in 2012 was a landmark victory for indigenous rights – how did it shape how you see the world?
Gualinga: The Sarayaku case is a symbol of resistance. Throughout my childhood, the leaders of my community – many of whom are family – were violated, facing defamation, violence, torture and criminalization for their defiance. It sparked rage in me and my community.
But when Sarayaku won, we showed the world that you can fight big oil because no political or economic force is powerful enough to exploit land when its people unite.
Our victory inspired other Indigenous peoples protecting their lands and sends a powerful message to the companies and banks invested in projects that violate our rights. Their time is up!
After living in fear of losing our home, my peers and I have followed in our elders’ footsteps in defying the systems that uphold violence against people and nature.
Last month, a youth gathering was held in Sarayaku where Indigenous youth from across the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Amazon gathered to discuss the future of our territories and reaffirm our commitment to protect Kawsak Sacha.
Kawsak Sacha – a decolonized shift in mindset, rooted in Indigenous practices – is vital to stand against human greed and fight climate change. We need to replace Western conservation methods with Indigenous stewardship.  Western models treat nature as something separate from humans, while Indigenous peoples see ourselves as part of nature, which we have lived with for thousands of years, and seek to pass on to future generations.
CNN: You don’t identify with the label ‘activist’ – why is that?
Gualinga: I don’t identify as an activist because I do not believe we had a choice. Where I come from, most of the Amazonian Indigenous population would be considered “activists.”
If Sarayaku did not put up a fight, our territory would have been destroyed. It’s a matter of survival rather than acting out of choice.
My region, Latin America, is one of the most dangerous places for Indigenous people and land defenders. Our life’s work has been to protect our lands – our existence is our resistance.
The mere existence of people in the Amazon is what is securing the future of the Amazon. Does that make us activists? No. It is simply part of who we are and where we come from. It’s a defense mechanism of nature itself.
CNN: Why are indigenous voices important in the global conversation on climate?
Gualinga: Our communities have been raising the alarm bell on the climate crisis as we see the changes to the environment firsthand. We are on the front lines of keeping fossil fuels in the ground as we work to defend our lands.
As the world is moving away from fossil fuels, it’s now being replaced by the green energy industry. However, the transition to a green economy must ensure that it includes Indigenous peoples in decision-making – and that it does not repeat the same colonialist approach of the fossil fuels industry.
However, the green energy industry is currently not adequately including Indigenous peoples in decision-making.
Unfortunately, indigenous territories will be ground zero for exploitative practices in the transition to green energy.
Helena Gualinga
Where will these resources come from? Unfortunately, indigenous territories will be ground zero for exploitative practices in the transition to green energy. For example, across Latin America, mining for lithium, ‘the new gold,’ is intensifying and leaving indigenous communities in extremely poor conditions.
In the Amazon we have also seen hydro dam projects happen on Indigenous territories without prior and informed consent from Indigenous people. Often these projects are classified as “green,” however impacts on Indigenous communities have not been adequately addressed and accounted for.
It’s essential that Indigenous people not only have a say in climate negotiations, but that discussions are also led by Indigenous people, so that all climate action is guided by climate justice.
Indigenous people have tended ecosystems for thousands of years. The knowledge we have obtained interacting and coexisting with nature for years is essential to understand how we will restore and find balance between humans and nature.
To understand this, let’s look at the numbers. Indigenous peoples comprise less than 5% of the world population but we protect 80% of the Earth’s biodiversity in the forests, deserts, grasslands, and marine environments in which we have lived for centuries.
CNN: Are you hopeful COP27 will bring change?
Gualinga: I do not have high expectations for COP27. A sense of urgency about the climate crisis has still not reached the negotiating rooms despite millions of people suffering from its devastating consequences.
COP has yet to deliver on the big promises the parties have made throughout the years. In particular, COP27 needs to make sure Indigenous people are at the front and center at the negotiations to ensure an outcome that accounts for the injustice we are facing in protecting our rights, lands and the world’s biodiversity.
Countries must put nature at the heart of their mitigation and adaptation plans.
And the most pressing conversation to be had is the end of fossil fuel extraction. The climate crisis will continue if we do not close the oil tap, halt extractive industries and the financing of energy projects that violate the rights of Indigenous peoples and threaten ecosystems like my home.

My community, Sarayaku, for example, is currently divided into several oil blocks – meaning the government has allocated our territories for the exploration for and production of oil – which means we live under a constant threat. Much of the trade of Ecuadorian Amazon crude oil is financed by European banks, some of which may be attending COP27 with inconsistent promises and Net Zero pledges.
COP27 needs to recognize the expiration date of fossil fuels is now. It needs to acknowledge our wisdom on climate solutions as stewards of the land and provide funding and resources so we can help to cultivate a just future.
Nature is at stake – and it will not be safe until governments are held accountable.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described oil blocks and omitted a line about the financing of the crude oil trade."
The US-China climate deal was a rare bright spot in an otherwise thorny relationship. Should it be mended?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/world/us-china-climate-cooperation-competition-cop27/index.html,"The US-China climate deal was a rare bright spot in an otherwise thorny relationship. Should it be mended?
One of the biggest surprises at last year’s United Nations climate summit came in the form of a handshake.
US climate envoy John Kerry and his China counterpart Xie Zhenhua did so at COP26 in Glasgow as they announced a commitment to cooperate on the climate crisis. The countries vowed to work together to reduce their fossil fuel emissions, and China pledged to release a plan to slash its emissions of methane – a powerful planet-warming gas – which it delivered on this week.
The terms of the agreement weren’t terribly specific, and it didn’t come with many measurable action points. But the deal was still widely applauded as a step in the right direction in an otherwise discontented geopolitical relationship.
It didn’t last long.
The newfound cooperation abruptly fell apart in August when China suspended climate talks with the US – one of several measures it took in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan.
The question now is whether COP27 in Egypt can provide the jolt of momentum needed to mend the countries’ climate change relationship. Kerry told CNN on Thursday that he has been having informal conservations with Xie this week but that “we are not formally negotiating at this point.”
“Our hope is that within a short span of time, it will become possible for us to really get together again in full measure and do the things we need to be doing as the two leading emitters in the world and as the two largest economies in the world,” Kerry said.
Before the summit, Kerry told reporters that the ultimate decision to resume formal talks rests with China President Xi Jinping. Biden and Xi are expected to meet at the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia.
“That will come from one person, and until then we are in limbo,” Kerry said of Xi.
There are many reasons, as Kerry notes, that the two countries should be in sync on the climate crisis. Not only are they historically the most to blame for climate change, their actions also have significant sway in the rest of the world, which look to the US and China to lead on the issue.
Yet, now that cooperation is ostensibly at a standstill, some experts are weighing whether it is necessary; could competition lead to faster change?
A race to the top
Going into Egypt, one big thing is different from last year – the US has actually passed a massive climate law.
Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act contained $370 billion in clean energy and climate funding and included tax credits for electric vehicles and batteries written in a way to compete with China.
But China had a head start in the clean-energy race and has spent the last decade cruising ahead on wind and solar. Last year, China installed 80% of the world’s new offshore wind capacity, dwarfing the rest of the world’s nations, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. It is also surging ahead on electric vehicles and buses; about a quarter of all new passenger cars registered in China are electric.
The US has a lot of catching up to do, but it’s “back in the race,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, a professor of energy and environmental policy at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.
“I believe a healthy competition between the two countries will benefit everyone,” she said. “This new money is going to be a really important global injection into clean energy technology and innovation, and it’s likely to catalyze even more (development) in China. But in many respects, China currently has a first-mover advantage; there’s a lot of work for the US to do.”
In China, the US climate bill is being viewed as a “competitive gesture,” and with a certain amount of skepticism that the US can move as fast as it wants to on the clean energy transition, according to Li Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia.
“Part of this sentiment is sour grapes, but I think part of it is based on cool-headed analysis – if you are a country who manages to ramp up renewable energy from zero to huge in 10 years, you know the secret to success better than anyone else,” Shuo said.
Chinese officials “are not convinced the US is capable of replicating it,” Shuo said. “Only the US can prove itself and the stakes – our climate future – are high.”
The case for cooperation
The US and China – due to the sheer scale of their planet-warming emissions, money and political heft – have historically been the power players at international climate summits. It’s no different this year, with all eyes on the two countries and whether they’ll resume collaboration.
Kerry told CNN on Thursday that US-China cooperation is essential as the world tries to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
“China and the US really need to cooperate on this,” Kerry said, noting that it would be impossible to keep warming to 1.5 degrees without the country. “If we don’t have China, nobody else can make it to that goal.”
And there has been a flicker of positive news at COP27.
Xie announced Tuesday at COP27 that his country has developed a national strategy to reduce its methane emissions, fulfilling the promise it made at last year’s summit as it pledged to cooperate with the US.
Speaking at a panel event in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Xie said China’s methane strategy will focus on three areas: reducing methane from its energy sector, agriculture and waste management areas.
However, within the energy sector, Xie only mentioned reducing emissions from oil and gas – and didn’t mention China’s coal sector, which produces much of the country’s methane emissions in addition to CO2 emissions. China produces the most methane emissions from coal mines in the world, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Xie’s announcement is the latest evidence that cooperation between the world’s two largest emitters matters – even more so because of the peer-pressure effect it can have on other countries.
“We have seen times where [US-China cooperation] is producing good results; a positive force in both the domestic context of each country, and also a boost to the international discussions,” said Nate Hultman, director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability, and a former Kerry official. “In that context, the suspension of the talks is a hindrance.”
The end of the US-China agreement triggered an information void as the lines of communication shut down – something that could breed mistrust, according to Sims Gallagher.
“I’m sure China knows we passed the (Inflation Reduction Act),” Sims Gallagher said. “At a high level that’s understood. But at the granular level, it’s much harder to understand what’s happening and why it’s happening.”
A senior administration official conceded they think something has been lost due to the suspended talks, killing the momentum that came out of the US and China’s joint declaration at Glasgow last year. That official said it is still an open question whether cooperation can continue this year.
Ultimately, it is in China’s best interest, and the world’s, to resume talks with the United States, said Joanna Lewis, associate professor of energy and environment at Georgetown University, because it elevates China’s stature going into a key international summit – allowing a country that is often cast as the climate villain some positive spin.
“When the Chinese lead negotiator and the US lead negotiator get up before the world together, it calls China out as a leader and puts them on a new level of climate leadership,” Lewis said. “Particularly during an international negotiation where they’re not always viewed as taking a leadership role.”

Kerry announces – and is immediately criticized for – a new plan to raise money for climate action,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/world/cop27-kerry-finance-offset-plan-intl-climate/index.html,"Kerry announces – and is immediately criticized for – a new plan to raise money for climate action
US climate envoy John Kerry announced a new, controversial plan Wednesday to raise cash for climate action in the developing world – by selling carbon credits to companies wishing to offset their polluting emissions.
Speaking at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Kerry said the initiative, which he said should be “up and running” within a year, would help finance energy transition in vulnerable countries. He said that Chile and Nigeria were two countries that had already expressed interest in the scheme.
But the plan has already attracted criticism because of the way it will be financed – with money raised in sales of carbon credits, which allow companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own.
The idea that rich countries must help poorer nations finance their efforts to get rid of fossil fuels and transition into renewable energy is a key part of the Paris Climate Agreement – but in terms of real money, little has materialized so far.
Facing economic turmoil, high inflation and soaring energy prices, many governments find it difficult to secure taxpayer money for climate projects in distant countries.
The Kerry team is also aware that securing billions of dollars in international climate aid is an uphill battle in the US Congress, which must approve it through budget appropriations.
If US President Joe Biden intends to deliver on his pledge to shore up around $11 billion in funding, the administration must look to other avenues – including leveraging the private sector — to get it done, said Gina McCarthy, Biden’s former national climate adviser.
“It was very clear to me that President Biden made a commitment to really accelerate the kind of resources to the developing world, but it’s equally clear Congress had no interest in moving that forward,” McCarthy told CNN last week. “That could be part of the dilemma in the US; while the administration understands we have a commitment, you don’t have a Congress that seems willing to move forward.”
That’s why Kerry is tapping into the private sector. The scheme was announced in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund, and Kerry said Bank of America, Microsoft, Standard Chartered Bank and PepsiCo were among companies that were already showing “strong interest” in the initiative. He added that fossil fuel companies were not involved in the plan.
‘Offsets are not an answer’
While calls to provide more money to vulnerable countries are now stronger than ever, Kerry’s plan has not been received well by some advocates and experts.
Many argue the concept of offsetting carbon emissions amounts to little more than “greenwashing.” The key concern is that if companies are allowed to purchase carbon credit offsets, they’ll be less willing to cut their emissions.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday that “shadow markets for carbon credits cannot undermine genuine emission reduction efforts.”
“Targets must be reached through real emissions cuts,” Guterres said, adding: “Fossil fuels must be phased out and renewable energy scaled-up.”
Kerry said after his announcement that he had met with Guterres on Wednesday and that the UN chief was supportive of the initiative as long as there were “safeguards” involved.
Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the proposal was “no substitute” for the “real public finance” that developing countries need.
“Carbon offsets are not an answer in a world already on fire, under water and facing mounting climate losses and damage,” Cleetus said. She added that low- and middle-income countries need “grants-based public finance from richer countries … rather than questionable carbon offset schemes that risk allowing companies to pollute at the expense of the planet.”
Kelly Stone from ActionAid USA said the “US has already repeatedly failed to meet their obligations” to provide climate finance to poorer countries.
“Now is the time for the US to take responsibility for how much it has contributed towards climate injustices,” she said.
CNN has asked the Kerry team for comment on the criticism, but has not yet received a response.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said last month that governments must triple their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. There is a significant financing gap: the IEA said it expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade – up 50% from today’s spending."

A former NBA champion is changing ‘how the world builds’ to fight the climate crisis
Three years ago, a hurricane devastated the Bahamas, claiming dozens of lives. Today, the country is building what it claims to be the world’s first carbon-negative housing community to reduce the likelihood of future climate disasters and to ease the shortage of homes caused by the storm.
Rick Fox, a former Los Angeles Lakers player, is the lynchpin of the new housing project. The former basketball player and Bahamian citizen was spurred into action after he witnessed the destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Fox teamed up with architect Sam Marshall, whose Malibu home was severely damaged by wildfires in 2018, to develop Partanna, a building material that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The technology is being put to the test in the Bahamas, where Fox’s company, Partanna Bahamas, is partnering with the government to build 1,000 hurricane-resistant homes, including single-family houses and apartments. The first 30 units will be delivered next year in the Abaco Islands, which were hardest hit by Dorian.
“Innovation and new technology will play a crucial role in avoiding the worst climate scenarios,” Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas, said in a statement. He is due to formally announce the partnership between the Bahamian government and Partanna Bahamas on Wednesday at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.
As a country on the frontline of the climate crisis, the Bahamas understands that it’s “out of time,” Fox told CNN Business. “They don’t have time to wait for someone to save them,” he added.
“Technology can turn the tide, and at Partanna we have developed a solution that can change how the world builds,” Fox said.
Partanna consists of natural and recycled ingredients, including steel slag, a by-product of steel manufacturing, and brine from desalination. It contains no resins and plastics and avoids the pollution associated with cement production, which accounts for around 4%-8% of global carbon emissions from human activities.
The use of brine, meanwhile, helps solve the desalination industry’s growing waste problem by preventing the toxic solution from being discarded back into the ocean.
Almost all buildings naturally absorb carbon dioxide through a process called carbonation — which is where CO2 in the air reacts with minerals in the concrete — but Partanna says its homes remove carbon from the atmosphere at a much faster rate because of the density of the material.
The material also emits almost no carbon during manufacturing.
A 1,250 square foot Partanna home will contribute a “negligible amount” of CO2 during manufacturing, while removing 22.5 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere after production, making it “fully carbon negative within the product’s lifecycle,” according to the company.
By comparison, a standard cement home of the same size typically generates 70.2 tons of CO2 during production.
The use of salt water means that Partanna homes are also resistant to corrosion from seawater, making them ideal for residents of small island countries such as the Bahamas. That could make it easier for homeowners to get insurance.
The carbon credits generated from each home will be traded and used to fund various social impact initiatives, including promoting home ownership among low-income families.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated losses suffered by Rick Fox and Sam Marshall as a consequence of Hurricane Dorian and wildfires.

The world needs India to avert climate catastrophe. Can Modi deliver?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/india/india-climate-change-efforts-cop27-intl-hnk/index.html,"The world needs India to avert climate catastrophe. Can Modi deliver?
It’s not unusual for temperatures in India’s Thar Desert to reach 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit). Even when they drop, hot winds sweep across the bare plains. The soil here is infertile, water is scarce. This place is near unlivable for humans – but it’s ideal for one of the world’s biggest solar farms.
The Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan state, near India’s border with Pakistan, is a symbol of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s gargantuan ambitions to transform his nation into a green energy powerhouse. By 2030, Modi wants half of India’s energy to come from renewables.
It’s a huge and admirable goal from the world’s third-biggest carbon emitter, but achieving it will require trillions of dollars and some tough decisions by Modi.
While renewable energy is growing faster in India than in any other major economy, the country remains reliant on coal, which has long powered the country’s growth and accounts for more than 80% of its energy mix. Indian officials have also said the country plans to expand its use of the fossil fuel even as many of its nearly 1.4 billion people choke on the pollution it causes.
In the past, India has defended its use of planet-warming fossil fuels in the name of development – a stance that has seen it criticized at international climate talks.
At last year’s COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, India led a last-minute objection to language in a proposed joint statement around phasing out coal. Its chief delegate argued government fossil fuel subsidies to the public must continue – how else could India get fuel like natural gas to poor people who are still burning wood to cook their meals, he asked.
That exchange highlights the contradiction at the heart of India’s stance on climate change – that Modi’s government can continue to set lofty goals, but when it comes to realizing them, his country is caught in a Catch-22 between development and decarbonization.
India’s Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh demonstrated that dilemma in September when he announced plans to add 56 gigawatts of coal power to India’s energy mix by 2030 while also investing in renewable energy – emphasizing the need to prioritize reliable power for growth.
That’s bad news for the global fight against climate change, where India’s actions have widespread ramifications.
India emits over 2.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year based on data collected by the EU.  An analysis of its plans by the Climate Action Tracker show that the country’s goals are “critically insufficient” to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above levels before industrialization. Warming beyond that threshold will trigger irreversible damage and push many ecosystems to tipping points, climate science shows.
“As one of the world’s largest emitters, what India does is crucial for the world to meet the 1.5˚C limit,” said Hannah Fekete, co-founder of NewClimate Institute who has over a decade of experience quantifying the impact of policies on emissions.
And nowhere are the contradictions in India’s stance clearer than in Rajasthan. The state is fast becoming a hotbed of solar energy, yet is also home to at least seven coal-fired power plants.
Just 400 miles from the Bhadla Solar Park sit four of the world’s five most polluted cities, according to the 2021 World Air Quality Report. On any given day, they are blanketed in the grey soot and ash of burned coal.
A global problem with individual consequences
According to a report on Climate Change in the Indian Mind from Yale University’s School of the Environment, 81% of Indians surveyed were worried about global warming, with 50% saying they were “very worried.” In addition, 64% say their government “should be doing more to address global warming.”
Still, few would claim climate change is a problem for India alone to solve. Indeed, the picture changes substantially when its emissions are seen in the context of its massive population. Per capita figures show that Indian people actually contribute relatively very little to the problem. While the average American emits 14.7 tons of CO2 a year, an Indian person emits around 1.8.
However, despite the low level of per capita emissions, the weight of the country’s struggles can be disproportionately felt on an individual level.
In Delhi, the world’s fourth most polluted city, people are seeing first-hand the impacts of the country’s coal consumption.
Resident Rohit Sharma, 36, told CNN, “We are frustrated when we look at other cities where there is not much pollution and the lives that they are able to live but we cannot.”
“The air pollution is going to impact everything,” he added. “We will have health issues, breathing issues and our life span will be cut short.”
His colleague Kunal Sharma, 28, worries about what life could look like in coming years. “If no concrete action is taken, life after 10 years is going to become extremely difficult,” Sharma said. “What can we do? We have to live here.”
The Modi government has been encouraging Indians to live more sustainably – in October launching a program that urged drivers to turn off their engines at red traffic lights and for people to take the stairs instead of the lift.
But the question isn’t just whether the world can count on the Indian public to decarbonize – it’s also about whether Indians can count on their government to do so, too.
A costly choice
Even as much of the world came to a standstill during the Covid-19 pandemic, India kept ramping up its renewables. Between 2019 and 2021, the share of India’s energy that comes from renewables increased by almost 3%, according to a 2022 report from the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi.
India has had “a sustained increase in renewable energy installation,” Nandini Das, an energy research and policy analyst at the research institute Climate Analytics, told CNN. “Even during Covid it hasn’t stopped.”
At COP26, Modi outlined a series of targets for India’s efforts to combat climate change. He pledged that by 2030, India would have increased its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts – from 156.83 in 2021 – and would be using renewable energy sources to meet 50% of its energy needs.
Experts say India is on track to meet Modi’s non-fossil fuel target by increasing nuclear energy and hydropower, but the country’s shorter-term goals – such as having 175 gigawatts of renewable energy installed by the end of 2022, enough to power up to 131 million homes – hang in the balance.
A report by S&P Global earlier this year said India may not meet its 2022 target, partly because the country still lacks a clear commitment to phasing out coal.
It’s also a question of funding – investing in renewable energy and other climate change mitigation efforts is expensive.
The developed world was supposed to be providing $100 billion a year to developing nations to help them slash their emissions and adapt to the climate crisis. That goal has never been met.
It’s money India could use. To achieve just its wind and solar targets for 2030 would cost $223 billion, according to a BloombergNEF analysis. And in the 2019-2020 financial year, India raised only a quarter of the funds needed annually to meet its initial climate goals, according to a report published by Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), an independent, non-profit research group.
If India doesn’t receive the financial support it needs, maintaining its pace on developing renewable energy will be difficult. Increasing it will be even harder.
In Rajasthan, projects like the Bhadla Solar Park have helped the state exceed its renewables goals, but experts say that success isn’t happening widely enough.
“If India sticks to its current approach, which includes expanding coal-fired power generation and infrastructure to increasingly use imported LNG, it risks massive stranded assets in the fossil energy sector and an increased dependence on energy imports,” Fekete, from the NewClimate Institute, told CNN.
“India should instead focus fully on renewable energy, with international support as needed.”
She says it if it doesn’t, India’s greenhouse gas emissions are set to increase by 2030, which will make global targets even harder, if not impossible, to reach.
“Given the size of India, this puts the global temperature goal of 1.5°C at risk,” Fekete said.

Aftab Khan felt helpless when torrential floodwaters submerged a third of Pakistan, his home country.
Khan’s hometown was completely underwater. His friend rescued a woman who had walked barefoot, carrying her sick child, through stagnant floodwaters for 15 miles. And Khan’s own mother, who now lives with him in Islamabad, was unable to travel home on washed-out roads to check if her daughter was safe.
“These are heart-wrenching stories, real stories,” Khan, an international climate change consultant, told CNN. “I was heartbroken.”
Pakistan became the clearest example this year of why some countries are fighting for a so-called “loss and damage” fund. The concept is that countries which have contributed the most to climate change with their planet-warming emissions should pay poorer countries to recover from the resulting disasters.
Earlier this year, Pakistan cooked under a deadly heat wave that climate change made 30 times more likely, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Now it is reeling from the aftermath of the worst floods in living memory.
The South Asian country is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, but it is paying a heavy price. And there are many other countries like it around the world.
Loss and damage will be center stage at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this year, as low-emitting countries inundated with floods or watching their islands sink into the ocean are demanding that developed, high-emissions countries pay up for this damage.
But it’s been a contentious issue for years, as rich countries like the United States fear that agreeing to a loss and damage fund could open them up to legal liability, and potential future lawsuits.
Climate activists in developing nations and a former top US climate official told CNN time is running out, pointing to Pakistan’s cascading disasters as the clearest evidence why a dedicated loss and damage fund is needed.
The developing world is “not prepared to protect themselves and adapt and be resilient” to climate disasters, former White House Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN. “It’s the responsibility of the developed world to support that effort. Commitments have been made but they’re not being delivered.”
What is loss and damage?
As a concept, loss and damage is the idea that rich countries, having emitted the most planet-warming gases, should pay poorer countries who are now suffering from climate disasters they did not create.
Loss and damage is not a new ask. Developing countries and small island states have been pressing for these kinds of funds since 1991, when the Pacific island Vanuatu first proposed a plan for high-emitting countries to funnel money toward those impacted by sea level rise.
It took more than a decade for the proposal to gain momentum, even as much of Vanuatu and other small island Pacific nations are slowly disappearing.
In Fiji, climate activist Lavetanalagi Seru’s home island, it has cost an average of $1 million to relocate communities because of sea level rise. Moving away from ancestral lands is not an easy decision, but climate change is having irreversible impacts on the islands, said Seru, the regional policy coordinator with the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network.
“Climate change is threatening the very social fabrics of our Pacific communities,” Seru said. “This is why these funds are required. This is a matter of justice for many of the small island developing states and countries such as those in the Pacific.”
Why is loss and damage controversial?
A major reason this type of fund is contentious is that wealthy nations are concerned that paying for such a fund could be seen as admission of liability, which may trigger legal battles. Developed nations like the US have pushed back on it in the past and are still tiptoeing around the issue.
Khan said he understands why rich developed nations are “dragging their feet.” But he added that it’s “very important for them to empathize and take responsibility.”
There has also been confusion about its definition – whether loss and damage is a form of liability, compensation or even reparations.
“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry said on a recent call with reporters. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”
Kerry has committed to having a conversation on a fund this year ahead of a 2024 deadline to decide on what such a fund would look like. And US officials still have questions – whether it would come through an existing financial source like the Green Climate Fund, or an entirely new source.
Kerry also sparked some controversy on the topic at a recent New York Times event, when in response to a question on loss and damage, Kerry seemed to suggest that no country has enough money to help places like Pakistan recover from devastating climate disasters.
“You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars, cause that’s what it costs,” Kerry said at the event.
But others say the money is there. It’s more a matter of priorities.
“Look at the annual defense budget of the developed countries. We can mobilize the money,” Alden Meyer, senior associate at E3G, told CNN. “It’s not a question of money being there. It’s a question of political will.”
What do experts think can actually get done?
At COP27, the biggest debate will be over whether to create a dedicated financial mechanism for loss and damage – in addition to existing climate finance meant to help countries adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy.
After climate-ravaged nations called for a new loss and damage finance facility at COP26 in Glasgow last year, it’s likely it will be an official COP27 agenda this year. But even as wealthier countries like the US and EU nations have committed to talk about it, there’s not a lot of hope countries will emerge from Sharm in agreement about a fund.
“Do we expect that we’ll have a fund by the end of the two weeks? I hope, I would love to – but we’ll see how parties deliver on that,” Egypt ambassador Mohamed Nasr, that country’s main climate negotiator, told reporters recently.
But Nasr also tamped down expectations, saying that if countries are still haggling over whether to even put loss and damage on the agenda, they’re unlikely to have a breakthrough on a financing mechanism.
He said it’s more likely that the loss and damage conversation will continue over the two weeks of Sharm, perhaps ending a framework established for a financing mechanism – or clarity on whether funds might come from new or existing sources.
Some officials from climate-vulnerable nations warned that if countries fail to come to an agreement now, the problem will be much worse later.
“For countries not on the front line, they think it’s sort of a distraction and that people should focus on mitigation,” Avinash Persaud, special envoy to Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, told CNN. “If we had done mitigation early enough, we wouldn’t have to adapt and if we’d adapted early enough, we wouldn’t have the loss of damage. But we haven’t done those things.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated how much money has been spent to relocate communities in Fiji because of sea level rise. It's an average of $1 million per community, according to Lavetanalagi Seru.

He recently was appointed the Ted Turner Professor of Environmental Media at The George Washington University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
In 1991, the small island nation of Vanuatu raised a question on the global stage that rich nations have been avoiding ever since: Who should pay for climate catastrophe?
At the time, Vanuatu – on behalf of an alliance of small-island states – argued quite reasonably that polluters should pay for the costs of their pollution.
It was an urgent question – with remarkable foresight. Vanuatu is in a low-lying archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, and its territory is threatened as global temperature increases contribute to rising sea levels worldwide.
Indeed, entire nations could be lost if fossil fuel pollution continues unabated.
There should be an “insurance pool … used to compensate the most vulnerable small island and low-lying coastal developing countries for loss and damage resulting from sea level rise,” Vanuatu’s ambassador, Robert Van Lierop, proposed to United Nations climate negotiators, according to a 2019 article in the journal “Climate Policy.”
More than 30 years later, this issue of irreversible “loss and damage” from the climate crisis is set to be one of the central issues as diplomats and world leaders convene in Egypt for the COP27 climate negotiations.
After decades of deflection, it’s overdue for high-polluting countries like the United States to take this question seriously. It’s clear that polluters should be held accountable for these losses to territory, culture, life and property.
Yes, it is also absolutely critical that the world abandons fossil fuels as quickly as possible. That is another central discussion point at COP27, and the world is well behind on its goal of holding warming to 1.5 or at most 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages. (We’re on track for about 2.7 degrees of warming, based on current policies; recent climate bills passed by the US Congress are a step forward, but are not enough).
The less carbon we put into the atmosphere, the less risk we put into the climate system — with important consequences for sea levels, storms, drought, biodiversity and so-on.
Still, there can be no justice without action on loss and damages.
Arguments against action have taken many forms over the decades. The most laughable, in retrospect, is that this was a problem for the future rather than the present.
We now see clearly that the climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather worldwide. Look no farther than the deadly floods in Pakistan this summer or Hurricane Ian in Florida this September. Disasters are getting more expensive because they’re becoming more intense as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and swamp the atmosphere with heat-trapping gasses.
That may feel like a new phenomenon, but it’s been decades in the making. Scientists linked a deadly 2003 heat wave in Europe, for example, to human-caused warming. That heat wave killed an estimated 20,000 people.
The onslaught of ever-worsening heat waves, droughts, wildfires and storms can feel both urgent and numbing. The truth is that as long as humans have been burning fossil fuels, we’ve been making the planet more dangerous.
Other arguments against loss-and-damage payments should be seen plainly for what they are: excuses and stall tactics. The harm is undeniable at this point, as is the cause. Oxfam estimates these climate losses will total $1 trillion per year by 2050.
What’s trickier is sorting out the mechanism for payment.
The UN’s Secretary General called in September for a tax on fossil fuel profits.
“The fossil fuel industry is feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns,” António Guterres said.
“I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis; and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices,” he added.
Arguments against action have taken many forms over the decades. The most laughable, in retrospect, is that this was a problem for the future rather than the present.

The oil and gas industry has raked in $2.8 billion per day in profits over the last 50 years, according to a recent analysis. That includes more than $31.3 trillion in profit for fossil fuel companies between the year 2000 and 2019, according to a recent report, “The Cost of Delay,” released by the Loss and Damage Collaboration and supported by two dozen organizations.
That $31 trillion in profits is about 60 times what would have been needed to cover economic losses from climate disasters in the world’s most vulnerable countries over that same period, according to the report. Those profits should be seen as immoral given what we know — and have known for decades now — about the harm burning fossil fuels cases globally.
Last year’s COP26 in Scotland resulted in promises to continue discussing the issue of “loss and damage” but there was no real action. Vanuatu and other vulnerable nations shouldn’t be put on hold for further years or decades. It’s clear that this bill is substantially overdue.
Short of international efforts to fund a loss-and-damage process, countries and individuals are turning to the courts. A Peruvian farmer, for example, is suing a German fossil fuel company over a melting glacier that threatens his home and farm. The suit, filed in 2015, according to news reports, claims the German company, RWE, should be liable for its proportion of the damages, in line with the proportion of global fossil fuel pollution it has created. (RWE is contesting the lawsuit and says it should not be held responsible for the damage.)
And in 2021, Tuvalu and other countries formed the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law. The aim is to explore claims in international courts.

“Litigation is the only way we will be taken seriously while the leaders of big countries are dillydallying,” Gaston Browne, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, said last year, according to The New York Times. “We want to force them to respond in a court of law.”
Those efforts should be supported, but the fair and proactive thing is for rich countries to impose taxes on fossil fuel profits. That can be done as part of UN climate negotiations.
It won’t fix the crisis, but it would help establish a sense of climate justice.

Heavy rain in Florida could impact election week as a tropical system heads toward the US,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/weather/weather-tropical-system-alantic-florida-sunday/index.html,"Heavy rain in Florida could impact election week as a tropical system heads toward the US
It’s the last month of hurricane season and there are two tropical disturbances in the Atlantic, one of which may bring troubling weather to Florida on Election Day.
The system that may impact Florida is currently bubbling over the southwestern Atlantic, just north of Puerto Rico, where a flood watch is in place through Monday afternoon. The tropical disturbance has already brought over 5 inches of rain to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands since Saturday – and an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain is forecast for the region Sunday.
“Even though drier air is expected to move in (later on Sunday), the soils are very saturated and the rivers are still running higher than normal,” the National Weather Service office in San Juan said. “Therefore, any significant rainfall could quickly cause urban and river flooding.”
Tropical chances increase for Florida this week
As the tropical disturbance tracks north and away from Puerto Rico today, weather and oceanic conditions are looking more favorable for additional development and strengthening. Which is why the National Hurricane Center has given this system a high chance of development over the next 48 hours. Adding that “a subtropical or tropical depression is likely to form early this week.”
Some forecast models are even hinting that the system could become a tropical storm before it approaches Florida and the Bahamas this week, although some uncertainty remains in the longer-range forecast.
The system is forecast to strengthen as it tracks west of the Bahamas on Monday, however a high-pressure system will also be building across the eastern US at the same time.
“This building high pressure will have the tendency to send the area of low pressure westward towards the Florida peninsula, although exactly what this system will look like is still not well understood,” the weather service office in Miami said early Sunday.
Regardless of when and how much this disturbance strengthens, impacts across Florida will be felt as early as Tuesday.
“High seas, coastal flooding, beach erosion and life-threatening rip currents are some of the most likely impacts from this system,” the Miami weather service said. “Land impacts are murkier at the moment as these are more dependent on the exact type of system that will be propagating towards the peninsula.”
The type of system matters. If the system remains subtropical the strongest winds and heaviest rainfall associated with it could impact a larger area, farther away from the center. If the system is a tropical cyclone (depression, storm, or hurricane) the strongest winds and heaviest rainfall could be more impactful but located closer to the center of where the storm tracks.
“At the very least, periods of heavy rain are likely Tuesday through Thursday although (weather) model solutions are still divergent on both timing and intensity of this system,” the weather service in Miami added.
These weather forecast models are showing at least 3 to 6 inches of rainfall across the Florida peninsula through Thursday, with isolated higher amounts possible.
On Election Day specifically, the current forecast for the Sunshine State calls for breezy to gusty conditions for much of the Florida Peninsula and rain chances will increase throughout the day for central and eastern cities such as Miami north to Daytona Beach and inland toward Orlando and Okeechobee.
If you plan on voting in person on Tuesday, you may want to pack a windbreaker and umbrella if you have to stand outside.
A second tropical system may develop
There is also a second system in the Atlantic that is worth mentioning because it could impact the name that is given to the system above, if either strengthen enough to gain tropical storm status.
This tropical disturbance is located over the open Atlantic and is not forecast to impact land over the next several days.
Regardless “a short-lived tropical depression or storm is likely to form later today while the system drifts slowly over the central Atlantic,” the hurricane center said.
If either system if named this week, the first will be given the name Nicole, followed by Owen. Which could be the 14th and 15th named storms of the year.
An average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. Currently this season has recorded 13 named storms, seven hurricanes and two major hurricanes (Fiona and Ian).
If there are 14 named storms in a year, the average date of formation would be November 19, however, if two storms are named this month that would be unusual – because November storms are not particularly common.
On average a named storm in November only happens once every 2 to 3 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information.
Last year no named storms formed in the month of November, but in 2020 there were three – Eta, Theta, and Iota. Hurricane Eta was the last November storm to hit Florida when it made two separate landfalls at tropical storm strength. Since the satellite era – beginning in 1960 – only five tropical systems have made landfall in the Sunshine State – Eta, Mitch, Gordon, Keith, and Kate.

"As countries convene at climate summit in Egypt, reports show the world is wildly off track. Here’s what to watch at COP27",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/world/cop27-egypt-what-to-watch-climate/index.html,"As countries convene at climate summit in Egypt, reports show the world is wildly off track. Here’s what to watch at COP27
As global leaders converge in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the UN’s annual climate summit, researchers, advocates and the United Nations itself are warning the world is still wildly off-track on its goal to halt global warming and prevent the worst consequences of the climate crisis.
Over the next two weeks, negotiators from nearly 200 countries will prod each other at COP27 to raise their clean energy ambitions, as average global temperature has already climbed 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution.
They will haggle over ending the use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, which has seen a resurgence in some countries amid the war in Ukraine, and try to come up with a system to funnel money to help the world’s poorest nations recover from devastating climate disasters.
But a flood of recent reports have made clear leaders are running out of time to implement the vast energy overhaul needed to keep the temperature from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold scientists have warned the planet must stay under.
Reports from the United Nations and the World Meteorological Association show carbon and methane emissions hit record levels in 2021, and the plans countries have submitted to slash those emissions are beyond insufficient. Given countries’ current promises, Earth’s temperature will climb to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100.
Ultimately, the world needs to cut its fossil fuel emissions nearly in half by 2030 to avoid 1.5 degrees, a daunting prospect for economies still very much beholden to oil, natural gas and coal.
“No country has a right to be delinquent,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry told reporters in October. “The scientists tell us that what is happening now – the increased extreme heat, extreme weather, the fires, the floods, the warming of the ocean, the melting of the ice, the extraordinary way in which life is being affected badly by the climate crisis – is going to get worse unless we address this crisis in a unified, forward-leaning way.”
Here are the top issues to follow at COP27 in Egypt.
A fight over ‘loss and damage’
Developing and developed countries have for years tussled over the concept of a “loss and damage” fund; the idea which suggests countries causing the most harm with their outrageous planet-warming emissions should pay poorer countries, which have suffered from the resulting climate disasters.
It has been a thorny issue because the richest countries, including the US, don’t want to appear culpable or legally liable to other nations for harm. Kerry, for instance, has tiptoed around the issue, saying the US supports formal talks, but he has not given any indication of what solution the country would sign on to.
Meanwhile, small island nations and others in the Global South are shouldering the impact of the climate crisis, as devastating floods, intensifying storms and record-breaking heat waves wreak havoc.
The deadly flooding in Pakistan this summer, which killed more than 1,500 people, will surely be an example the countries’ negotiators point to. And since September, more than two million people in Nigeria have been affected by the worst flooding there in a decade. At this very moment, Nigerians are drinking, cooking with and bathing in dirty flood water amid serious concerns over waterborne diseases.
Loss and damage will have space on the official COP27 agenda this year. But beyond countries committing to meet and talk about what a potential loss and damage fund would look like, or whether one should even exist, it is unclear what action will come out of this year’s summit.
“Do we expect that we’ll have a fund by the end of the two weeks? I hope, I would love to – but we’ll see how parties deliver on that,” Egypt’s chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr recently told reporters.
Former White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN she thinks loss and damage will be the top issue at the UN climate summit this year, and said nations including the US will face some tough questions about their plans to help developing nations already being hit hard by climate disasters.
“It just keeps getting pushed out,” McCarthy said. “There’s need for some real accountability and some specific commitments in the short-term.”
A tense US-China relationship
People will be watching to see if the US and China can repair a broken relationship at the summit, a year after the two countries surprised the world by announcing they would work together on climate change.
The newfound cooperation came crashing down this summer when China announced it was suspending climate talks with the US as part of broader retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.
Kerry recently said the climate talks between the two countries are still suspended and will likely remain so until China’s president Xi Jinping gives the green light. Kerry and others are watching to see whether China fulfills the promise it made last year to submit a plan to bring down its methane emissions or updates its emissions pledge.
The US and China are the world’s two largest emitters and their cooperation matters, particularly because it can spur other countries to act, too.
Can the world raise enough money?
Separate from a potential loss and damage fund, there is the overarching issue of so-called global climate finance; a fund rich countries promised to push money into to help the developing world transition to clean energy rather than grow their economies with fossil fuels.
The promise made in 2009 was $100 billion per year, but the world has yet to meet the pledge. Some of the richest countries, including the US, UK, Canada and others, have consistently fallen short of their allocation.
President Joe Biden promised the US would contribute $11 billion by 2024 toward the effort. But Biden’s request is ultimately up to Congress to approve, and will likely go nowhere if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections.
The US is working on separate deals with countries including Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia to get them to move away from coal and toward renewables. And US officials often stress they want to also unlock private investments to help countries transition to renewables and deal with climate effects.
Countries are straight up off-track
COP27 is intended to hold countries’ feet to the fire on fossil fuel emissions and gin up new ambition on the climate crisis. Yet reports show we are still off-track to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.
A UN report which surveyed countries’ latest pledges found the planet will warm between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius. Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.
Records were set last year for all three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
There is a spot of encouraging news: the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles is surging and helping to offset the rise in fossil fuel emissions, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.
But the overall picture from the reports shows there is a need for much more clean energy, deployed swiftly. Every fraction of a degree in global temperature rise will have stark consequences, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.
“The energy transition is entirely doable, but we’re not on that pathway, and we have procrastinated and wasted time,” Andersen told CNN. “Every digit will matter. Let’s not say ‘we missed 1.5 so let’s settle for 2.’ No. We must understand that every digit that goes up will make our life and the life of our children and grandchildren much more impacted.”
The clock is ticking in another way: Next year’s COP28 in Dubai will be the year nations must do an official stocktake to determine if the world is on track to meet the goals set out in the landmark Paris Agreement.

What are ‘emissions?’ What is ‘net zero?’ Here are the climate change terms you should know,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/world/climate-change-terms-explained-cop27/index.html,"What are ‘emissions?’ What is ‘net zero?’ Here are the climate change terms you should know
Editor’s Note: This glossary has been adapted from a version originally published in October 2021.
The whole world seems to be talking about the climate crisis, thanks to months of wild weather and new science showing that we need to act quicker than we previously thought to avoid the worst consequences.
As global leaders meet in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh for annual climate talks, they’ll be using a lot of technical lingo. But the terminology isn’t particularly helpful and can be daunting.
Even the name of the summit – COP27 – sounds more like a bad police drama than a climate event. (First pointer: COP is short for Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change. It convenes global leaders, scientists and negotiators on climate, and usually takes place annually. The “27” means this will be the 27th meeting.)
Here are other terms to know to keep up with the talks, understand what’s at stake and, most importantly, sound smart around the dinner table.
1.5 degrees
A key goal of recent COPs, and of the fight against climate change in general, is “keeping 1.5 alive,” which refers to a target to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. It’s a target that some fossil fuel-producing countries have resisted, and scientists have warned of significantly worse impacts if this threshold is breached.
The countries that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 agreed to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees.
However, a UN report released in October found that current pledges and plans to reduce emissions will not get us anywhere close to staying under this threshold. The latest global pledges, including some made in the past year since COP26, will reduce planet-warming emissions in 2030 by about 5% – but a 45% reduction is what’s needed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees.
Under current climate policies, the report said that the world will reach 2.8 degrees by 2100.
The UNs’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its latest state-of-the-science report that the world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees above than pre-industrial levels, and is now hurtling fast toward 1.5 degrees.
Renewable energy
Scientists have showed that the world needs to transition away from fossil fuel and toward renewable energy to keep global temperatures from rising more.
Renewable energy comes from sources that can’t run out, and the term is typically used to describe energy sources that have no or very low planet-warming emissions.
Although they were created in natural processes, fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil are limited in that they take millions of years to form deep underground.
Common examples of renewable energy include wind, solar and geothermal.
Wind turbines harnesses the atmosphere’s natural kinetic energy and converts it into electricity. The planet’s potential to generate wind energy is vast, particularly in very windy locations offshore.
Solar power is generated by converting sunlight – our most abundant natural energy resource – into electricity through photovoltaic panels.
Geothermal energy involves using the Earth’s heat that’s way below ground level to heat homes, water or generate electricity.
Pre-industrial levels
This usually refers to average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere before the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 18th century.
CO2 levels are estimated to have been around 280 parts per million at that time. By 2021, that concentration had risen to 415.7 parts per million, according to the latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin released by the World Meteorological Organization ahead of COP27.
Scientists also talk about pre-industrial levels for average temperatures, using the period 1850-1900 to determine how hot or cold the Earth was before humans began emitting greenhouse gases in large volumes.
Net zero emissions
Net zero emissions can be achieved by removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as what’s emitted, so the net amount added is zero.
To do this, countries and companies will need to rely on natural methods – like planting trees or restoring grasslands – to soak up carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas we emit, or use technology to capture the gas as its emitted so it doesn’t enter the atmosphere.
Dozens of countries have already pledged to achieve net zero by mid-century and there is huge pressure on the remaining countries to do so.
Negative emissions
To save the world from the worst effects of climate change, scientists say it’s probably not enough to reach net zero – we’ve got to hit negative emissions.
Negative emissions is the situation where the amount of greenhouse gas removed from the atmosphere is actually more than the amount humans emit. This would require a significant energy overhaul as countries would need to ramp up renewable energy rapidly and invest heavily in technology to suck emissions out of the atmosphere.
Carbon sinks
This is a reservoir that absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locks it away.
Natural sinks like trees and other vegetation remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis – plants use the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to grow. The ocean is also a major carbon sink because of phytoplankton which, as a plant, also absorbs carbon dioxide.
Scientists say preservation and expansion of natural sinks – like the Amazon Rainforest – are crucial to reducing emissions.
There are also artificial carbon sinks that can store carbon and keep it out of the atmosphere. More on that below.
Carbon capture and storage
Technology to remove and contain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is known as carbon capture and storage. Carbon is usually captured at source – directly from coal, oil or gas as it burns – but new technology is being developed to literally suck carbon from the ambient air.
In both cases, the carbon can be stored, usually buried in reservoirs underground or below the floor of the sea, in what are known as artificial carbon sinks. Some scientists warn that it could be risky to inject so much carbon underground, and this process isn’t currently used on a large scale. The Global CCS Institute says just 27 commercial facilities are fully operating worldwide, while more than 100 others are in development.
But other experts say this technology is necessary to put a real dent in our emissions.
There are many ways to capture and store carbon. Here are some of them:
NDCs
Nationally Determined Contributions – or NDCs – is a term used by the UN for each country’s individual national plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
In the 2015 Paris Agreement, which nearly the whole world signed on to, countries were given the freedom to determine themselves how they would go about meeting the agreement’s key targets to slow global warming.
NDCs are supposed to be updated every five years and submitted to the UN, the idea being that each country’s ambition will grow over time.
Climate finance
More than 10 years ago at COP16 in Cancún, Mexico, the developed world agreed to transfer money to developing countries to help them limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the climate crisis. They set up the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to facilitate some of this transfer, but countries and donors can send money through any means they like.
The money was supposed to build up and reach $100 billion annually by 2020, and that commitment was reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement. This money is often referred to broadly as “climate finance.”
But the 2020 target was missed, and filling the gap is high on the agenda for the talks in Egypt this year.
Developing nations, particularly those in the Global South, which are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, argue that industrialized nations are historically more responsible for climate change and must do more to fund changes to help developing nations adapt and transition their economies to renewable energy.
US President Joe Biden pledged to double the US’ existing contribution plans, including money for the Green Climate Fund, in a speech at the UN General Assembly in 2021.
Whether Biden can marshal that much funding is still unclear; Congress has not yet finished its appropriations process for the coming fiscal year, and it remains to be seen whether the amount of money the president wants for climate finance can pass by the end of the year.
Adaptation
Adaptation refers to the way humans can change their lives and infrastructure to better cope with the impacts of climate change.
These changes might include building early warning systems for floods, or barriers to defend against rising sea level, for example.
In some places where rainfall is decreasing, planting drought-resistant  varieties of crops can help ensure communities have enough food to eat.
Mitigation
Put simply, this refers to how humans can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or remove them from the atmosphere, to ease the consequences of climate change.
Examples include using fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas more efficiently for industrial processes, switching from coal and gas to renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power for electricity, choosing public transport to commute over private vehicles that run on gasoline, and expanding forests and other means of absorbing carbon.
Unabated coal
You might hear leaders talking about ending “unabated” coal use. Unabated coal refers to coal burned in power stations where no action – or “abatement” – is taken to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by its use.
In short, this creates a loophole for to keep using coal in a net-zero world, if the greenhouse gas it emits is captured.
Very few coal plants in the world, however, are using abatement technologies, and transitioning to renewables is often more economically feasible in the long term than employing them.
In its 2021 report “Net Zero by 2050,” the International Energy Agency states that a “rapid shift” will be needed away from fossil fuels to achieve the goal, requiring steps such as “phasing out all unabated coal and oil power plants by 2040.”
EVs
That’s electric vehicles to you and me.
As electricity generated by renewables, like wind and solar, becomes more available, people are expected to start buying electric vehicles in greater numbers, especially as they become more affordable. That will mean fewer cars powered by oil on the roads, which will be a major topic at COP27 given the global energy crunch amidst Russia’s war in Ukraine.
There may also be references to PHEVs – those are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are mostly powered by a battery charged from an electrical source but also have a hybrid internal combustion engine to allow travel over longer distances.
Just transition
This refers to the idea that the drastic changes needed to combat climate change should be fair to everyone.
As environmental campaign group Greenpeace says: “Put simply, a just transition is about moving to an environmentally sustainable economy (that’s the ‘transition’ part) without leaving workers in polluting industries behind. It aims to support good quality jobs and decent livelihoods when polluting industries decline and others expand, creating a fairer and more equal society – that’s what makes it ‘just.’”
Biodiversity
Biodiversity refers to all the Earth’s living systems, on land and in the sea.
The UN’s Global Biodiversity Outlook report published just over two years ago warned that the accelerating climate crisis was worsening the outlook for biodiversity – that can mean all the trees, plants and animals in a forest, or all the fish and coral in a reef. “Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, and the pressures driving this decline are intensifying,” it said.
Challenges include habitat loss and degradation, mass extinction of species, declining wetlands, and pollution by plastic and pesticides.
Last year, the G7 countries – the seven largest advanced economies – agreed to conserve 30% of land and sea in their nations to protect biodiversity, a pledge they reaffirmed in 2022.

Opinion: The ocean’s ‘blue carbon’ can be our secret weapon in fighting climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/opinions/mittermeier-nicklen-oceans-blue-carbon-climate-change-scn-spc-c2e/index.html,"Opinion: The ocean’s ‘blue carbon’ can be our secret weapon in fighting climate change
Editor’s Note: Cristina Mittermeier and Paul Nicklen are marine biologists, award-winning conservation photographers, speakers and co-founders of SeaLegacy, a global marketing, education and communication agency for the ocean. Founded and led by a team of world class filmmakers, conservationists and photographers, SeaLegacy uses strategic communications at the intersection of art, science, and conservation to protect and rewild the ocean for the benefit of biodiversity, humanity, and climate.
Even as climate change is killing our seas, making them warmer and more acidic, we find hope that the ocean is increasingly being positioned not just as a victim of climate change, but rather, a solution.
Because it covers 70% of the Earth’s surface, the ocean is crucial in capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Recent scientific discoveries have found that marine ecosystems are far more efficient at sequestering and holding carbon than land-based plants or trees, trapping and storing carbon for thousands, if not millions, of years. The carbon captured by these ecosystems is often referred to as “blue carbon.”
Our work as nature scientists and wildlife photographers, as well as our tenures as assignment photographers for National Geographic and as founders of the ocean conservation organization SeaLegacy, has given us a first-hand perspective of humanity’s adverse effects on the oceans. This vantage point also gives us access to some of the world’s leading scientists, political leaders and economists, who agree that the ocean has a significant role in mitigating and solving the climate crisis. Their knowledge and perspective can only fill us with optimism.
Through its protective role, the ocean absorbs 25% of the CO2 humanity has released into the atmosphere and 93% of the excess heat trapped in the biosphere. But a healthy ocean can do so much more.
Read: Noise pollution is killing whales, but this technology could help
A year ago, we came across the work of Dr Carlos Duarte, who is on the leading edge of blue natural solutions, deciphering the unique power of marine ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forests, to decarbonize the atmosphere. His work shows that the ocean holds 16 times more carbon than the terrestrial biosphere.
The sea cannot, however, continue to carry on this planet-saving activity unless it is healthy. Along with a team of some of the best ocean scientists, in an article published in the journal Nature Dr Duarte has given us an achievable set of actions that can restore health and abundance to the ocean so that we may achieve the decarbonization of the planet.
They urgently recommend that we protect at least 30% of the sea by 2030. That means setting up large ocean areas where extractive activities like fishing and mining are banned. We must rethink the extraction of fish biomass from the sea through industrial fishing and find new, sustainable paths for it. We must also invest in advancing our capacity to restore degraded ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs and stem the flow of pollution entering the sea.
Finally, the most exciting recommendation is that we must take advantage of the ocean as a solution to climate change.
Carbon credits
Leveraging Duarte’s findings requires rapid and bold action, but it does not mean we must sacrifice our economic futures. In addition to being one of the most potent carbon sinks, a healthy sea can provide sustainable economic abundance across generations of a wide range of stakeholders.
At the cornerstone of this economic opportunity are blue carbon credits. Businesses and individuals can offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits issued against the protection of ocean carbon sinks.
The World Economic Forum says that global demand for carbon credits is projected to increase 15-fold by 2030 and be worth up to $50 billion by 2030, and that blue carbon will make up a significant portion of that.
This is great news for countries that hold blue carbon. In 2020, SeaLegacy’s partner scientists at the conservation non-profit Beneath the Waves, led by Dr Austin Gallagher, partnered with Dr Duarte to discover the largest seagrass meadow in the world in the Bahamas. Their latest research on the ecosystem was published this week in the journal Nature. At 92,000 square kilometers, this meadow alone can capture 3% of all global CO2 sequestered by the ocean.

This shift in positioning the ocean as a natural solution to climate change rather than a victim is happening worldwide. The ocean is a precious global resource and embracing its full potential will require hard work and innovation. The reward may be incalculable for economic interests and the planet.
We find enormous hope in knowing that embracing and investing in natural solutions can genuinely solve our generation’s most challenging problems while rebuilding the depleted blue natural capital of our oceans."
"California’s climate crisis is intensifying quickly and taking a heavy toll on residents, new data reveals",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/us/california-climate-crisis-impact-report/index.html,"California’s climate crisis is intensifying quickly and taking a heavy toll on residents, new data reveals
California’s climate crisis is quickly intensifying, impacting every resident and “increasingly taking a toll on the health and well-being of its people and on its unique and diverse ecosystems,” new state data reveals.
The ominous findings are from the Indicators of Climate Change in California Report, which was published through California’s Environmental Protection Agency.
“The stark reality of climate change in California is clear: record-high temperatures, an unrelenting drought, and unprecedented wildfires. The evidence continues to mount of the impacts of climate change on the health, safety, and well-being of the state’s residents,” authors of the report wrote.
The extensive report documents the causes and impacts of climate change by studying 41 scientifically measured indicators provided by more than 100 experts from state and federal agencies, research institutions, academia and includes input from 40 Native American tribes.
One of the most significant climate change impacts in California than the state’s recent extreme heat and multiyear drought.
In September 2021, the entire state of California was in a drought, with 88% in the most severe tiers of extreme to exceptional drought, the climate change report says.
That marked a one-month snapshot of a much longer trend: The last two decades were the driest in the past millennium, according to the report, which points to a 2.5-degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature since 1895 with that rise accelerating since the 1980s, said Amy Gilson, CalEPA’s deputy director for external and legislative affairs.
“This is driven primarily by warmer nights which are getting warmer at a rate three times faster than daytime temperatures,” Gilson said, noting that extreme heat events are becoming more frequent across the state.
Just this past September, the West Coast broke nearly 1,000 temperature records during a 10-day heat wave, CalEPA said. As many areas baked under triple-digit heat for several consecutive days, thousands of California residents were asked to ration their power use to avoid straining the grid.
“California is on the front lines of the climate crisis – and the latest data shows the impacts are rapidly accelerating,” Daniel Villaseñor, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s deputy press secretary, said in a statement to CNN. “Governor Newsom has taken more action to combat climate change than at any time in our history — the California Climate Commitment invests a record $54 billion to accelerate the transition to clean energy, cut pollution, and protect Californians from extreme weather.”
“The Governor is just getting started because he understands the urgency this moment demands,” Villaseñor added.
Climate change impacts many aspects of life
As temperatures rise and precipitation declines, annual snowpack and glaciers are vanishing from California’s high elevations, which in turn is straining reservoir and river levels in the state.
“In the Trinity Alps, the glaciers and snowfields have virtually disappeared,” Gilson said. “In the Sierra Nevada, some of the largest glaciers have lost 65% - 90% of their area.”
These shrinking glaciers represent a decline in freshwater supplies crucial for ecological needs.
Declining freshwater supply impacts the salmon population. It also impacts irrigation for agriculture – more than a third of the country’s vegetables and 75% of its fruits and nuts are grown in California, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
And the changes in temperature are also having an adverse effect on a wide range of species.
“In the Mojave Desert, bird populations have collapsed,” said Gilson, adding that “75% to 85% of the mammals and birds surveyed in the Sierra Nevada have changed where they are living. They’ve changed their elevations.”
The last 20 years saw a severe uptick in wildfires erupting across California, according to the report.
More than 4 million acres were charred in wildfires in 2020, more than doubling the area burned during any other year on record.
Plus, half of the state’s largest wildfires in the past 70 years happened in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by the hotter and drier weather and the ongoing megadrought. Overall, the average number of acres burned has increased dramatically in the last few years.
Climate change is also impacting human health, the report noted. Heat-related illnesses reported by California workers rose about threefold from 2000 to 2017, particularly impacting farm workers, police officers and firefighters.
Also, recent wildfires have led to deaths and injuries as well as widespread exposure to harmful levels of wildfire smoke, according to the report.
Native American tribes also pointed to climate change leading to soil erosion, loss of wetlands and springs, loss of plants as well as changes to animal migration patterns – which in turn cause a shift in diet and cultural practices.
“These impacts are tied to water, heat, wind and fire hazards and without a return of water to the area,” Gilson said.

"These glaciers are on track to disappear within the next 30 years, new report shows",https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/us/glaciers-world-heritage-sites-disappearing-climate/index.html,"These glaciers are on track to disappear within the next 30 years, new report shows
The climate crisis is touching nearly every region of the world. But perhaps one of the most visible indicators of its impact is its effect on Earth’s iconic glaciers, a major source of freshwater supply. Glaciers have been melting at a breakneck pace in recent decades, leading to around 20% of global sea level rise since 2000.
Now researchers at the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization have found that glaciers in one-third of the planet’s most beautiful parks and protected areas are set to disappear by 2050 – whether or not global warming is slowed.
Among the glaciers on the brink of vanishing at World Heritage sites are those in two of the most visited and most beloved parks in the United States – Yellowstone National Park, which saw unprecedented flooding earlier this year, and Yosemite National Park.
The list also includes some of the largest and most iconic glaciers in Central Asia and Europe as well as the last remaining glaciers in Africa, namely Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro.
Glaciers at World Heritage sites shed around 58 billion tons of ice each year, UNESCO reports, which is equivalent to the total volume of water used annually in France and Spain combined. And these glaciers have already contributed nearly 5% of global sea level rise in the last 20 years.
The study provides the first global assessment of both the current and future scenario of glaciers in World Heritage sites, according to Tales Carvalho Resende, project officer at UNESCO’s natural heritage unit and author of the report.
“This report brings a very powerful message in the sense that World Heritage Sites are iconic places – places that are extremely important for humanity, but especially for local communities and Indigenous peoples,” Resende told CNN. “Ice loss and glacial retreat is accelerating, so this sends an alarming message.”
Only by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels can we save glaciers at the other two-thirds of these parks, scientists report – a climate target that recent reports say the world is far from achieving. The global average temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.
Glaciers cover around 10% of land, providing fresh water supply for households, agriculture and industry downstream. Under normal conditions, they take as long as a millennium to fully form; each year, they gain mass through snow or rain, and lose mass by melting in the summer.
Melting glaciers may seem like a faraway problem, but Resende said it’s a serious global issue that can hit downstream communities hard. He highlighted Pakistan’s deadly floods this year, which left nearly one-third of the country underwater. Reports say the multiweek floods were likely triggered by a combination of heavier than usual monsoon rains and several glacial lake outbursts due to melting that followed the recent extreme heat that enveloped the region.
“As water melts, this water will accumulate in what we call glacial lakes; and as water comes, these glacial lakes might burst,” he said. “And this outburst can create catastrophic floods, which is something we can see very recently in Pakistan.”
Thomas Slater, a glaciologist at the University of Leeds in London, noted that these glaciers are contributing a small fraction of sea level rise compared to the amount of ice loss the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets could generate. Researchers like Slater have already found those ice sheets to be the major contributors to global sea-level rise this century.
“While it’s sad to hear some of these glaciers could be lost, we should take hope in the fact that reducing emissions can save the majority of them and avoid disruption to the water supply of millions of people worldwide who live downstream,” Slater, who is not involved with the UN report, told CNN.
With the rate at which the climate crisis is accelerating, more water will be released from glaciers. In drought-stricken areas like the Western US, an increase in meltwater may be a good thing, but Resende said it is only temporary.
Once a glacier’s peak water – the maximum meltwater it contributes to the system – has been reached, annual runoff decreases as the glacier shrinks to the point where it’s no longer able to produce water supply.
According to the report, many small glaciers in the Andes, Central Europe and Western Canada either have already reached peak water or are expected to in the coming years. Meanwhile, in the Himalayas, annual glacier runoff is forecast to jump around 2050, before it plunges steadily afterward.
If countries fail to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, or even 2 degrees, glaciers will only continue to recede, the report shows. In that future, places would see significant glacier runoff during the wet periods, with little to no flow to quench drier and hotter conditions.
“This is a hot topic currently in the research community – to see what will be the landscape after glacier melting,” Resende said. “Unfortunately, glaciers will keep melting because there’s always a delay. Even if we stop or drastically cut our emissions today, they will keep retreating because there’s this inertia – and it is extremely important that we manage to set up adaptation measures.”
The report comes as world leaders gather in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, next week for the UN-brokered international climate negotiations, where the focus will be on getting countries to commit to stronger fossil fuel cuts that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. They will also discuss plans to adapt to worsening extreme weather events including heat waves, floods and storms.
“We need to really unite ourselves, to make as much as possible this 1.5 objective feasible,” Resende said. “The impacts might be irreversible, so this is really a pledge to take urgent action.”"
Europe has warmed faster than any other region in the past 30 years,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/weather/europe-warming-fastest-continent-climate/index.html,"Europe has warmed faster than any other region in the past 30 years
As the climate crisis accelerates, Europe is warming faster than any other region, according to a new State of the Climate in Europe report from the World Meteorological Organization.
The WMO report comes ahead of the UN’s international climate summit in Egypt, and is one in a series of reports over the past several weeks that show how the world is off-track on its climate goals. Not only are countries missing the mark on their efforts to reduce planet-warming fossil fuel emissions, but measurements show temperatures are already skyrocketing.
Global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution, and scientists have warned that this temperature should be limited to just 1.5 degrees to avoid the most severe impacts of the climate crisis.
Some continents are feeling that rise more than others. Wednesday’s report shows temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years – at a rate of about 0.5 degrees Celsius per decade.
‘A live picture of a warming world’
Recent reports show how the region’s temperature rise is fueling extreme weather.
Year-to-date through July, the number of wildfires the EU was quadruple the 15-year average. A deadly, record-breaking heatwave in the UK strained public health and buckled infrastructure. Exceptional drought plagued the continent this summer, drying up some of the world’s most economically important rivers. And that drought that came on the heels of some of the most destructive floods Europe has ever seen.
In 2021, the last full year covered in Wednesday’s analysis, more than half a million people were directly affected by climate change-fueled weather events. Extreme weather caused economic damages exceeding $50 billion. And the accelerated warming has caused Alpine glaciers to lose 30 meters in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021, the report notes.
“Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a forward on the report. “This year, like 2021, large parts of Europe have been affected by extensive heatwaves and drought, fueling wildfires. In 2021, exceptional floods caused death and devastation.”
Accelerated warming has caused Alpine glaciers to lose 30 meters in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021, the report notes. And in Greenland, which is covered by the WMO regional analysis, rain fell for the first time ever in 2021 at the summit station high atop the ice sheet – part of a melting trend that has accelerated sea level rise.
“European society is vulnerable to climate variability and change, but Europe is also at the forefront of the international effort to mitigate climate change and to develop innovative solutions to adapt to the new climate Europeans will have to live with,” Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.
Taalas said in his forward that although Europe’s pace on cutting planet-warming emissions has been “good,” their ambition on this front “should be further increased.”
The report notes that greenhouse gas emissions decreased 31% between 1990 and 2020. The bloc is aiming to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030.
“As the risks and impact of climate change become increasingly apparent in day-to-day life, the need and the appetite grow for climate intelligence, and rightly so. With this report we aim to bridge the gap between the data and the analysis to provide science-based but accessible information that is ‘decision-ready’, across sectors, across professions,” Buontempo said."

The peak in global fossil fuel emissions is just around the corner
Global fossil fuel emissions are expected to peak in 2025 as countries commit huge sums of money toward low-carbon fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In its annual World Energy Outlook report, published Thursday, the agency said that Russia’s assault on Ukraine had the potential to “hasten” the global transition to clean energy sources.
The IEA said it expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade — up 50% from today’s spending.
“Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in the report.
“Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,” he added.
Since the war broke out in late February, many countries have shunned Russia’s vast energy exports, finding new suppliers and ramping up imports of alternate energy sources.
That has put Moscow in a “much-diminished position,” the IEA said, and Russia is on course for its share of global energy exports drop to 13% by 2030 from 20% last year.
Europe — Moscow’s biggest customer for oil and gas — has borne the brunt of the energy crunch. Benchmark natural gas prices have shot up since the invasion, though have dropped steeply in recent weeks thanks to mild temperatures and the bloc’s successful efforts to store gas for winter.
“Russia [has] lost this market forever. And it will be very difficult [for] this Russian oil and gas [to] find a new home as big as Europe, as lucrative as Europe,” Birol told CNN’s Julia Chatterley in an interview on Thursday.
Earlier this week, Birol said that intense competition for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and cuts in oil output by OPEC and its allies had led to “the first truly global energy crisis,” according to a Reuters.
Thursday’s report will be welcomed by those who’ve worried that the crisis has set the world’s climate goals back.
Fears of energy shortages have led some countries in Europe and China to burn more coal this year. Hard coal power generation jumped nearly 15% between March and September in Europe in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, according to the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.
Overall, though, growth in coal burning has been “muted” this year, Birol told CNN.
And, for the first time ever, the IEA’s annual forecast sees demand for all fossil fuel to either peak or plateau. Oil is expected to be the last holdout, reaching a plateau by the mid-2030s, the report said.
“Governments are putting real money on the table to accelerate the green energy [transition], not necessarily for environmental, climate reasons, but mainly for energy security reasons,” Birol told CNN.
Despite the flurry of clean energy investment, the agency said that it expects global temperatures to rise by 2.5 Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — well above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) upper limit needed to avert severe consequences for the climate. The world has already warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution.
Governments will also need to raise their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the report said.
“There is still a large gap between today’s pledges and a stabilization of the rise in global temperatures around 1.5°C,” the IEA warned.

"World still way off track on goal to keep global warming below dangerous threshold, UN says",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/world/un-global-climate-pledges-health/index.html,"World still way off track on goal to keep global warming below dangerous threshold, UN says
Nations are still way off track to limit global warming below a dangerous threshold as catastrophic extreme weather events are already threatening the health and food security of people around the world, a pair of reports have found.
The United Nations reported Wednesday that global warming will rise to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius based on the world’s current climate pledges – way beyond the 1.5 degrees nations are trying to stay below. The report shows that there is still much more work to be done to transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels, which are pushing global temperatures higher and triggering more intense extreme weather events.
Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.
The UN report comes ahead of its COP27 climate summit in November, where countries will meet to raise their ambition on the global crisis. Experts said the latest UN numbers show that countries need to be more ambitious on their climate commitments.
The report “sounds the alarm that progress on climate commitments has slowed to a crawl since the Glasgow climate summit last year,” Taryn Fransen, senior fellow at the World Resources Institute’s climate program, told CNN in a statement.
Fransen added that the UN’s finding of the world warming 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius is “dangerously high.”
A separate report from the Lancet found that the health of people around the world is “at the mercy of a persistent fossil fuel addiction.” But despite the health harms, governments and companies “continue prioritizing fossil fuels to the detriment of peoples’ health.”
The Lancet report said that continuing to pursue fossil fuel energy “would lock the world into a fatally warmer future with catastrophic health impacts.”
According to the report, extreme heatwaves in 2020 were associated with 98 million more people suffering from moderate to severe food insecurity than annually in 1981-2010. And from 2017 to 2021, heat-related deaths increased 68% compared to 2000-2014, the report found.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement that livelihoods and natural economies are being pummeled, “as the fossil fuel addiction spirals out of control.”
“The climate crisis is killing us,” Guterres said. “It is undermining not just the health of our planet, but the health of people everywhere.”
Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told CNN that the UN’s findings on global climate targets underscore the need for urgent action to transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels.
Andersen said that 1.5 degrees “is a goal that is still on the map, but the longer we procrastinate, that window is closing. She noted that even if countries met all their new climate pledges, combined with net zero commitments, it would get the globe to 1.8 degrees of warming by 2100.
“The pathway we are on today, that doesn’t get us there,” said Andersen. “If we want to hit 1.5, we need to reduce our emissions by 45% by 2030. That’s a large percentage. Is that doable? It’s in our hands – we developed a vaccine in less than a year. I don’t want to say it’s impossible. But it will take commitment, leadership, bravery, and real courage by leaders to make it happen.”

The first time I was evacuated was the summer of 2018. I crammed the last of my stuff into the back of the truck and looked across the street. Flames crested the top of the hill, licking the sky and threatening to descend on the community below. Strong gusts of wind rattled my blinds, and cars pulled over on the side of the road to watch the nightmarish scene. It was the 4th of July, but that year no one was celebrating.
Climate change has played a significant role in my daily life since moving to the mountain town of Basalt, Colorado, five years ago. Major roads close regularly due to flooding and mudslides, cutting off our town from the resources of the city. Most summers, smoke inhalation is an inevitable part of recreating outdoors, and it’s become commonplace to check the air quality index daily to see if it’s safe.
I’ve taken up fly fishing as a hobby, and Colorado Parks and Wildlife advises anglers to refrain from fishing when the water temperature in our rivers hits 67 degrees – as it places high stress on the fish. Tourism is down when snow totals are low in the winter, which affects a major source of income for my rural community.
And then there are the wildfires.
I remember my eyes were glued to the rearview mirror as I drove away from my house on July 4, 2018. Eerie orange flames seemed to grow taller and taller on the hillside behind me. The smoke hung heavy in the air the next morning, stinging my eyes and making it hard to breathe – even with a mask – as I walked into the grocery store. There was a somber tone in the valley, and a very palpable fear in everyone’s eyes.
While my home was spared, there have been wildfires in the area nearly every summer since 2018 that remind me just how treacherous climate change can be.

We’ve all heard scientists and experts warn of the dangers of a warming world. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve been taught and encouraged to recycle, pick up trash and conserve water. From the Earth Day parades in elementary school, to the “reuse, reduce, recycle” trends of recent years, I’ve always been a big proponent of protecting the planet. But it didn’t really hit home until more recently.
I lived in a city for most of my life and, for many years, I felt largely immune to climate change. While I knew it was happening, I was protected from the immediate impacts. I’d turn on the TV and see climate disasters happening all over the world, and yet my daily life was largely uninterrupted.
That changed pretty soon after I moved to the mountains and had to evacuate from the Lake Christine Fire. While the fire was started by incendiary ammunition, my town, like much of the state, was experiencing severe drought conditions that propelled the fire across 12,000 acres with dried grass, brush and trees as kindling.
As a community, we rallied. We supported the firefighters and first responders day in and day out, from making sandwiches to providing housing and everything in between. I’d only lived in the Roaring Fork Valley for a year but felt deeply connected to my community in a way that was surprising. Tragedy will create bonds, regardless of background, ethnicity or political affiliation. The question is how much more we can take before we speak up, take action and demand more from our elected officials.
And it’s not just me, or my small town in Colorado. Extreme weather events are becoming more commonplace in every corner of the globe. This summer, an intense heat wave in Europe set record high temperatures, and fires broke out in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Ice shelves in Antarctica are crumbling faster than they can be replaced, and losses are double what was initially estimated by scientists in 1997.
Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico before it made landfall in Canada as a severe tropical storm. Historic floods in Pakistan affected 33 million people and left a third of the country underwater. Closer to home, the Marshall Fire in Boulder was the most destructive in Colorado history in terms of structures lost.
And these are just some events from this past year.

Moving to a small town has opened my eyes to the dramatic effects of a changing world. And there are lasting reminders – more than four years later, the burn scar from the Lake Christine Fire is still visible on the landscape whenever I drive down Highway 82.
Climate change has an economic impact as well. In the 2017-2018 season, snow totals were so low that our mountains couldn’t fully open all of the ski runs, and many employees who worked in hospitality were forced to take a two week “mandatory vacation.”
Climate change has become an undeniable fact of life in this area, and our safety, livelihoods and wellbeing are at stake.
Unfortunately, if we continue the way we’re headed … it’s just the beginning."
"Opinion: Methane is a global climate concern, but new technologies offer hope",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/opinions/methane-climate-technologies-tianyi-sun-spc-intl/index.html,"Opinion: Methane is a global climate concern, but new technologies offer hope
Editor’s Note: Tianyi Sun is a climate scientist with US-based non-profit advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund, which undertakes climate research and provides scientific guidance on climate-related work. The views expressed in this commentary are the author’s own. Read more opinion at CNN.
For years, carbon dioxide has been the bogeyman of climate change, and rightly so. But the focus on CO2 has allowed other greenhouse gasses to slide under the radar. Methane, in particular – a potent greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide, pound-for-pound, over a 20-year period – has been overlooked.
Lately, new science has helped policymakers realize that not only is methane a powerful climate threat – it also represents a crucial opportunity to slow the rate of warming quickly. And the faster we act, the bigger that opportunity will be.
Human-caused methane is emitted from fossil fuel operations, agriculture, coal mining, landfills and other industries. It’s also the main component of natural gas and is responsible for more than a quarter of current global warming, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.
Methane’s high potency is a problem, but the silver lining is that it dissipates in the atmosphere after about a decade, whereas carbon dioxide can last centuries. It means that efforts to reduce methane emissions offer the fastest route to slowing global warming.
By cutting methane pollution from human-caused sources as quickly as possible, scientists estimate we could slow the worldwide rate of warming by as much as 30%.
New findings from my colleagues and I at the Environmental Defense Fund suggest that immediate action to reduce methane emissions, along with drastic cuts in CO2, could help preserve Arctic summer sea ice through 2100 and beyond. This is a critical climate milestone that can help preserve habitat for Arctic wildlife and avert additional acceleration of warming.
Methane from fossil fuel production is often emitted alongside other chemicals — like volatile organic compounds — which contribute to ozone, another greenhouse gas. So reducing methane emissions can also help lower surface levels of ozone, benefiting air quality and crop yields.
High-tech emissions tracking
Solutions are available and methane detection is key. New technologies enable us to locate and measure methane emissions faster and with greater precision than ever before. From drones and aircraft to a new generation of observation satellites, researchers and regulators alike are equipping themselves with the ability to see, in real time, where emissions are taking place – and who is responsible.
Next year, Environmental Defense Fund’s new subsidiary MethaneSAT will launch its own satellite with the help of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It will provide near real-time, publicly available emissions data in higher resolution than ever before. We’ll be able to watch online whether emitters are living up to their promises to reduce methane emissions.
The first target: the global oil and gas system. In the US alone, oil and gas operators waste around 16 million metric tons of methane every year through leaks and flaring. Flaring is the process of burning away gas rather than letting it escape directly into the atmosphere, but research has shown that many flares malfunction or are extinguished and are therefore a significant source of methane emissions. MethaneSAT will allow us to verify, identify, and call out these emissions more effectively.
Existing technologies — such as regularly checking equipment for leaks and malfunctions that lead to methane emissions — can help eliminate 75% of emissions from the oil and gas sector, according to the International Energy Agency. At today’s elevated energy prices, nearly all these solutions can be implemented at no net cost.
Of course, the methane challenge extends far beyond the United States. World leaders have recognized both the urgency and the opportunity of methane reduction and have begun taking steps to capitalize on it.
Last fall, more than 100 countries signed the US and Europe-led Global Methane Pledge, agreeing to reduce their methane emissions 30% by 2030. Since then, other countries have signed on, with signatories now representing two-thirds of the global economy. With the help of MethaneSAT, we can hold these countries accountable for their promises to reduce methane.
Reducing methane emissions is the fastest, easiest and cheapest thing we can do to immediately slow the pace of climate change. Capturing all that methane could also help stabilize energy markets. For instance, an analysis by my colleagues at EDF found that if we captured the methane that escapes through leaks and flaring at U.S. oil and gas sites, we could meet half of the gas supply the US committed to Europe.
Transformational technology is making this opportunity possible, ushering in a new era of evidence-based accountability and transparency, which is exactly what we need to face down the climate challenge."
A cooler than normal winter is forecast for a dozen states amid rising energy costs,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/weather/winter-outlook-cold-forecast/index.html,"A cooler than normal winter is forecast for a dozen states amid rising energy costs
A dozen states could see cooler than normal temperatures this winter, according to NOAA’s outlook released Thursday morning. That could mean an increase in energy consumption across the northern tier of the US – amid rising energy costs.
“It takes energy to heat your house,” Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University who was not affiliated with NOAA’s outlook, told CNN. “So, the colder it is, the more energy we need for heating. And that’s bad news in a world where energy is constrained by things like the war in Ukraine.”
People from Oregon to Michigan may be feeling the pinch when they get their energy bills as temperatures are expected to be below normal during what is already the coldest part of the year.
“Putin has shut off Russian gas for Europe but they still need gas,” Dessler told CNN. “So they’re going buy US gas. That’s going to drive up the price for US consumers. So it’s definitely bad news for US consumers.”
In cities including Minneapolis, Seattle, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon, where the forecast predicts below normal winter temperatures, the concern is how people will react to higher consumer prices.
“Since the price will go up, and it will price people out, people will hopefully turn their thermostats down, as opposed to there being shortages,” said Dessler.
One area where this may be easier is the southern tier of the US, where temperatures are expected to be above normal. Even some of the big cities in the Northeast may catch a break. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore all have a 33% to 40% probability of above normal temperatures this winter.
The forecast also calls for drought-stricken areas such as Southern California, Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Mississippi River Basin to receive below average rainfall during the winter months.
“Drought conditions are now present across approximately 59% of the country, but parts of the western US and southern Great Plains will continue to be the hardest hit this winter,” said Jon Gottschalck, chief of the operational prediction branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “With the La Niña climate pattern still in place, drought conditions may also expand to the Gulf Coast.”
Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas will also see an enhanced wildfire danger over the next few months.
Drought is expected to impact the middle and lower Mississippi Valley this winter. This area, which is already seeing historically low water levels, is forecast to receive below normal precipitation this winter. Soil moisture will rebound in the upper Mississippi River Basin, but as that does not impact river levels, a significant improvement in those levels is not expected through the winter months.
Large-scale weather forecasts are strongly influenced by the effect of La Niña versus El Niño. Right now, La Niña is in effect. Essentially this means, “Equatorial sea surface temperatures are below average across most of the Pacific Ocean,” according to the prediction center.
The prediction center put the odds at 75% that La Niña would be in place through this winter. This will be the third winter in a row where La Niña has influenced the overall weather pattern.
La Niña and the polar vortex are driving the forecast
This typically creates drier conditions across much of the South and wetter conditions for the Pacific Northwest and portions of the Ohio Valley. La Niña also brings warmer temperatures to much of the South and mid-Atlantic, and cooler temperatures to the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies.
The climate prediction center is calling for a 75% chance of La Niña during the Northern Hemisphere winter (December through February).
“La Nina is an important factor, but I think whether we really have a cold or a warm winter across the US is much more dependent on the state of the polar vortex,” said Judah Cohen – director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a climate consultancy.
Cohen cites the recent record early snow in the Midwest as an example. “That’s related to this polar vortex stretching. I think we can expect even if we have an overall strong polar vortex, I would expect we’ll see these stretching events. So, we can get a very sharp turn to cold weather, but it doesn’t last long.”
The polar vortex is a circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole, moving in a counterclockwise direction – a polar low-pressure system.
Cohen also points out that we are seeing more weather whiplash in the winter, as far as temperatures go.
“I think with climate change, we’ve actually seen an increase in variability in the wintertime. So, whether we have a mild winter or cold winter, I think we’ll see kind of this ping pong or the windshield wiping effect from extreme temperatures.”
But even if you live in the southern portion of the US which is more likely to have an overall milder winter, there will still be short-term cold blasts that you have to plan for.
“You always have to be prepared,” Dessler said. “Even without seeing the forecast, I know we have to be prepared for a cold winter, because it can happen even in a warming world.”"

One in every three American adults say they have been personally affected by an extreme weather event in the past two years, according to Gallup. Public concern about the environment is near a two-decade high, according to a Gallup poll that found 44% of Americans worry “a great deal” about it. The polling organization says it’s the seventh year in a row that public worry over the issue is at a high level.
Experts say we’re already seeing the effects of climate change, as extreme weather events – catastrophic hurricanes, droughts, floods and wildfires – ravage communities all around the world with greater frequency.
For Katherine Keel, who had to evacuate from a wildfire in 2018, moving to the mountains of Colorado opened her eyes to the reality of a warming planet. “Climate change has become an undeniable fact of life in this area and our safety, livelihoods and wellbeing are at stake,” she wrote.
We asked nine experts to propose solutions that would mitigate the impacts of global warming, cut greenhouse gas emissions and help us reach our net zero goals.
Jonathan Foley and Jamie Alexander: Leverage many forms of climate leadership
After decades of stalling, the federal government is finally taking decisive action on climate change. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and other climate-related legislation has set the stage for significant progress toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions and building America’s renewable energy future.
It’s a great start, but federal policy alone won’t get the job done. Bringing climate solutions into the world at scale requires that every part of the economy bring its superpower to bear: genuine business leadership moving markets, investors and philanthropists shifting capital, workers building solar panels and wind turbines, and cities and states making climate solutions a reality in the places we live and work. And all of this will be accelerated by community leaders and activists keeping the pressure up and demanding accountability.
After all, leadership outside the Beltway pushed the climate agenda forward for years. Even before strong federal action, US emissions actually fell by 20% since 2007 and were on track to drop 30% by the 2030s. Now, thanks to federal investments, emissions are projected to drop by 40% instead. While federal legislation is critical, it will be responsible for roughly a quarter of these emissions reductions. Leadership from outside the Beltway will contribute the other 75%.
Multiple forms of climate leadership, leveraging each other, are needed to get the job done — as long as the work is guided by science, a commitment to equity and justice, and an unfailing moral compass. And these other leaders can move quickly, along other fronts, and do things the federal government can’t do — with less delay and political compromise.
In the end, it’s leadership from all of us – in the private sector, government and diverse communities around the nation – that will be needed to address climate change. And it’s time for all of us to step up.

Jessica Dunn: Recycling electric vehicle batteries will help meet demand for critical materials
Transportation is the biggest contributor to US greenhouse gas emissions, and the shift from gasoline to electric cars will play a key role in the fight against climate change.
But the mining of materials to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries presents numerous challenges, including supply chains vulnerable to disruption and harmful social and environmental consequences.
Given that the demand for these materials is only expected to increase, recycling EV batteries provides an opportunity to build a more sustainable future while shoring up domestic supply chains.
When an EV battery has reached the end of its life, materials recovered from battery recycling can be used to make new ones, reducing the need for mining. Recycling infrastructure is already growing in North America. Estimates show that, in 2050, recycled materials have the potential to meet roughly half of the demand for cobalt and nickel, and a quarter of the demand for lithium for EVs in the United States.
Ensuring all batteries are eventually recycled is key to increasing EV sustainability, and policy can help. In the US, there has been government-funded research and development into new recycling processes, and the California legislature convened stakeholders to explore policy solutions. But the European Union and China are ahead of the US in enacting recycling requirements for EV batteries. We can do more at the federal and state level.
Switching to EVs is essential to slow climate change and create a sustainable future. Smart policies that encourage battery recycling are an important part of the solution.

Ama Francis: Common sense actions the US can take on climate displacement
Recent deadly monsoon flooding in Pakistan and tens of billions of dollars in damage in the wake of Hurricane Ian in the US serve as reminders that extreme weather is affecting people on a previously unthinkable scale.
Climate change intensifies disasters that push people from their homes, creating “climate migrants” all around the world. In fact, environmental disasters are already the leading cause of internal displacement globally – more than war or conflict, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.
While many migrants relocate within their country, a growing number have to cross international borders to find safety, including to the United States. Unfortunately, our immigration laws have yet to keep pace and need to be updated to include protections for climate migrants.
The good news is there are common sense actions the US can take to address this issue:
It’s rare that the right thing and the smart thing align – but in this case they do. The US has contributed the most to carbon emissions over time, and addressing climate migration provides an opportunity to ensure equity, mitigate our demographic deficit, and uphold the dignity and safety of climate migrants all at once.
Climate change is not an insurmountable future issue, it’s a solvable present-day one. As we approach the upcoming midterm elections, it’s imperative that candidates recognize that fact and commit to supporting these solutions if elected.

Ramón Cruz: Make sure IRA funding is spent in favor of underserved communities
The historic investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) reflect what many state officials have already acknowledged: We must take urgent steps to curb the climate crisis. State governments have a crucial role in the equitable implementation of the IRA, as residents of their states increasingly experience the traumas of losing their homes, loved ones and livelihoods through climate-fueled disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes and droughts.
The impacts of the climate crisis are not confined to either blue or red states, but are felt in communities across the nation. This includes low-income communities and communities of color in Michigan, for example, that are among the most polluted in the country and have higher than average rates of asthma. It includes communities of coal miners suffering from black lung disease and struggling with access to medical care. These communities and many more remain in desperate need of support — which the IRA can provide.
The IRA’s investments include more than 100 programs that will invest $369 billion in climate action, clean energy jobs and environmental justice. This gives states the means to create family-sustaining jobs, improve the health of communities and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
One challenge is to channel funds efficiently, equitably and transparently from federal to state and local agencies. Governors should establish executive offices to ensure community organizations are active participants. Governors should issue executive orders enacting the Biden-Harris administration Justice40 initiative to invest in disadvantaged communities at the state level, similar to Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina while remaining transparent like Governor Steve Sisolak in Nevada on infrastructure funding.
As voters go to the ballot box, we must cast our votes for candidates who will proactively address our collective problems, not score petty political points. Let’s make communities, climate action and environmental justice the true winners this election season.

Rich Powell: Let’s move beyond false climate choices
Climate debates in Washington are often based on false choices: renewables versus fossils, economy versus environment, 100% global emissions reduction versus inaction at home. The truth is, no government or business will achieve climate goals and see economic success unless all energy resources are on the table. So, let’s ask ourselves some key questions.
If solutions are only focused on reducing emissions to net zero here in the US while China continues emitting, what have we really accomplished? If America’s power sector transitioned entirely to clean energy at the cost of reliability or affordability, would the public support the change? Will our industry move overseas to higher emitting locations?
Economic inflation, high gas and electricity prices, global supply chain chaos, Russia’s war in Ukraine and China’s effort to dominate markets have all combined to create an ongoing energy crisis. Lawmakers in both parties can work together on the biggest question: How do we restore American energy independence while working to solve the climate challenge?
There is a path both parties can follow. First, leverage American innovation and make clean energy cheaper. If two technologies are the same price and one is cleaner, utilities and industries worldwide will buy the cleaner alternative.
Second, lawmakers can modernize permitting to build cleaner and faster. Nobody argues against protecting the environment, but it shouldn’t take nearly five years on average to site a solar field, wind farm, natural gas plant or new transmission line. We need to cut approval periods by more than half.
Third, let’s think global and lead with America first. US emissions are trending down from 14% to 12.7% of the global total, and unless we equip other nations with clean technology, our efforts will never solve the global problem.
If we eliminate the false choices and unleash American resource independence, we can solve the climate challenge.

Pippa Brashear: Rethink how we build infrastructure – and work with nature
We cannot move toward a more just climate future if we continue to build infrastructure the way we have for the past century. We need to stop relying solely on shored-up single-purpose gray infrastructure like bulkheads and seawalls and start embracing blue-green infrastructure and the complexity of natural systems. This means preserving natural areas that are still intact and reviving landscape systems at a regional and national scale. Blue-green infrastructure works with nature, instead of against it – combining carbon capture, improved resilience, greater adaptability and greater biodiversity – while being less expensive to maintain and operate.
Demonstration projects already exist. In Raritan Bay, just off Staten Island in New York, we’re in the process of building Living Breakwaters, nature-based infrastructure that will reduce the risk of wave damage, mitigate erosion along the beach and create a habitat for marine species – including oysters that can help filter the water and, we hope, catalyze more projects like it. Louisiana is currently wrapping up its 2023 Coastal Master Plan, which includes some of the largest restoration projects in US history, such as sediment diversions – designed to redirect water, sediment and nutrients to starving wetlands, mimicking the natural processes that once enabled them to thrive so this critical natural infrastructure can continue to help mitigate flooding and erosion.
We’re at an inflection point for the climate movement. The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act marks a paradigm shift so big that it’s easy to overlook $2.6 billion in grants the law allocates to coastal communities and tribes for climate adaptation. This is a tremendous investment in nature-based infrastructure. The next step? Connecting the dots: linking shovel-ready, blue-green infrastructure projects to funding, creating more precedents for enhancing ecosystems and ensuring communities have a personal and economic stake in their implementation.

Christina DeConcini: Research and development is key to our net zero goals
For those of us who have spent decades urging Congress to enact strong climate legislation, it is difficult to believe that, in one year, Congress enacted three significant pieces of legislation designed to rapidly accelerate clean energy development and deployment.
Most of the focus has been on the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act. Together these laws will deploy clean energy technologies – most of which are already commercially available after years of development – at a pace and scale necessary to put us in striking distance of our 2030 climate goals. This is fantastic, but we can’t stop there. In order to meet our net zero goals by 2050, we will need to rely on new technologies, much of which is still at the prototype phase, according to the International Energy Agency.
This brings us to the third and often overlooked piece of legislation: the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS). Most of the attention around CHIPS has focused on funding it has allocated to revive the American semiconductor industry. But, within CHIPS, there are critically important – but unfunded – provisions, which provide the framework and research policies necessary to bring emerging clean energy technologies to commercial viability at the pace necessary to meet the climate challenge.
Research and development can sound boring, but it is the essential ingredient for all innovation. The government has consistently played a leadership role in funding ongoing R&D across all sectors of the economy and embracing risks the private sector won’t – all in the name of the public good.
While CHIPS merely authorized funding, Congress must now appropriate the money for these provisions, which will go toward advancing energy storage, fusion energy, artificial photosynthesis and carbon sequestration research, among other things.

Ernesto L. Díaz: Protect our coasts
Rising sea levels will continue exacerbating beach erosion for decades – and even centuries – in the US.
Low-lying cities and communities currently exposed to regular coastal floods, erosion and direct wave impact are at greater risk. In Puerto Rico, for example, rising sea levels have placed 60% of its 1,225 beaches at risk of moderate to severe erosion, according to a report from Puerto Rico’s Climate Change Council. The island’s situation is particularly alarming since 61% of its population lives in the 44 coastal municipalities where flooding and storm surges have devastated communities in recent years.
Meanwhile, in Florida, more than 425 miles of beaches are already critically eroded, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. Last month, storm surge caused by Hurricane Ian obliterated several coastal communities.
The combined effect of rising sea levels and catastrophic storms will only cause more harm to these populations. It is imperative that cities and states come up with protection and adaptation interventions at built-up areas that currently experience coastal floods and beach erosion.
Protection may not be available to all due to the expensive nature of these plans, the complicated cost-benefit analysis process of agencies like the US Army Corps of Engineers and, in some cases, because communities refuse to retreat. Higher-cost public and private infrastructure are more likely to get funding for protection. However, low-income communities may not be eligible for federally funded projects, mainly because these communities have experienced significant floods for generations. This evidences the need to foster a balanced and equitable approach to reduce coastal risk.
While protection or retreat may be a challenge for developed areas, municipalities can use available sea-level rise projections to reduce risks through planning and updated building codes. Cities must develop land use plans and zoning regulations for the next several decades in order to reduce vulnerability and ensure that future investments meet and exceed the new infrastructure requirements.
Building codes and design standards must also be updated. Construction codes and standards play a vital role in building resiliency and adaption to projected sea-level rise. Measures such as building elevation, foundation design and others meant to combat moisture entrapment and damage from debris are key to ensure infrastructure resilience. These plans require political will, sustainable financing and a science-based process. The science is available, and these coastal communities can’t afford to wait any longer.

Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to rise by less than 1% this year as renewables and EVs take off
Finally, some good news in the battle against greenhouse gasses: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are on track to rise less than 1% this year.
That’s despite widespread concerns of a rush back to coal, oil and gas amid a global energy crunch and Russia’s war in Ukraine. We have electric vehicles and an uptake of renewables to thank for the surprisingly small increase.
The International Energy Agency published its forecast in a report Wednesday, showing CO2 emissions are on track for an increase of 300 million metric tons in 2022, reaching 33.8 billion tons. That’s a far smaller rise that the jump of nearly 2 billion tons in 2021 as the world rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The increase this year comes largely from the aviation sector, which was severely impacted by the pandemic.
“The global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a scramble by many countries to use other energy sources to replace the natural gas supplies that Russia has withheld from the market. The encouraging news is that solar and wind are filling much of the gap, with the uptick in coal appearing to be relatively small and temporary,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.
“This means that CO2 emissions are growing far less quickly this year than some people feared – and that policy actions by governments are driving real structural changes in the energy economy. Those changes are set to accelerate thanks to the major clean energy policy plans that have advanced around the world in recent months.”
The IEA said that without the major deployment of renewables and EVs globally, the rise in emissions would have been much larger, potentially as much as 1 billion tons.
Demand for coal has increased as Russia’s war in Ukraine sends natural gas prices soaring, and CO2 emissions from coal power generation, driven largely by Asia, are forecast to grow by more than 200 million tons, or 2%, this year.
But the increase in emissions from coal has been “relatively small” and are “considerably outweighed by the expansion of renewables,” according to the report.
The world has hit record growth this year in solar and wind power, generating more than 700 terawatt-hours of energy. That’s enough to power around 67 million American homes for a year.
And despite significant drought impacting huge swaths of the Northern Hemisphere, the overall picture for hydropower is still positive – global hydropower generation has increased this year and is expected to contribute more than one-fifth of growth in renewables.
The global outlook comes a day after a separate report showed that the EU has generated a quarter of its power from renewable sources since Russia launched its war, which is a record for the time period.
The IEA forecasts EU emissions to decrease this year, even though the bloc’s coal use is up. Several EU countries are using more coal in response to the hike in gas prices and as Russia cuts of supplies to some member states.
The report comes less than three weeks before the COP27 climate negotiations begin in Egypt, where countries are expected to ensure their emissions reduction plans are aligned with the main goals of the Paris Agreement: to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial times.
The IEA’s forecast makes for a rosier-than-expected backdrop to the talks, but scientists warn that emissions should be rapidly decreasing to keep the 1.5-degree goal in sight.

Treasury Department launches assessment of how extreme weather is increasing insurance rates,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/treasury-extreme-weather-insurance-rates-climate/index.html,"Treasury Department launches assessment of how extreme weather is increasing insurance rates
The Treasury Department announced on Tuesday it is launching an assessment of worsening extreme weather and its impact on the cost of insurance.
As climate change is making storms stronger and more destructive, Treasury officials told CNN they want to take a hard look at how climate-related disasters are driving up insurance rates around the country.
The department’s Federal Insurance Office is requesting zip-code level data from US insurance companies regarding their policies and prices. This is the first time the department has used its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to ask insurance companies for such high-resolution data on its policies.
Treasury intends to combine that information with climate data to “assess the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions of the country that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,” according to a news release.
Insurance companies are regulated by the states and Treasury officials have been receiving some data from state regulators. But what’s lacking is consistent and granular data that federal and state officials can use to understand how climate change is impacting insurance risk and rates, officials told CNN.
“We need a consistent, comparable granular set of data in order to understand the scale and scope of the problem and the risks we’re facing,” said Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Graham Steele. “The goal here is to get a granular, zip-code level picture of what’s happening and where, and what the impacts are on households and on the economy and financial system writ large.”
The data could ultimately be used to determine whether changes are needed in the US insurance market, Treasury officials told CNN, which has been reeling from back-to-back years of intense hurricanes in the Eastern US and wildfires in the West.
Even before Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida, homeowners in the state were paying three times the national average for their insurance premiums, CNN has reported – $4,231 a year, compared to a US average of $1,544, according to report from the Insurance Information Institute. Six insurers in Florida have gone insolvent this year, pulling out of the market and canceling their customers’ policies, leaving property owners with fewer and more expensive insurance options as they look to rebuild.
And much of the damage caused by Hurricane Ian and other tropical storms comes from flooding, which is not covered under standard homeowners’ policies and is primarily covered only by the National Flood Insurance Program run by FEMA. Hurricane Ian caused an estimated $17 billion of uninsured flood damage according to an estimate from CoreLogic, which estimates losses from natural disasters.
Treasury’s data collection could bring new transparency to an opaque market that millions of Americans rely on to insure their homes against weather-related risks, one expert said.
“We will see how brittle and unstable these markets are and really how arbitrary the pricing is at the end of the day,” Jesse Keenan, a professor of sustainable real estate at Tulane University’s School of Architecture, told CNN. “The scale of [climate change] and its impacts are so great; they’re extending beyond state borders.”
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement that Tuesday’s announcement “is an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change.”
“The recent impacts in Florida from Hurricane Ian demonstrate the critical nature of this work and the need for an increased understanding of insurance market vulnerabilities in the United States,” Yellen said.
Treasury is requesting public comments on the proposed data collection before it moves forward with the project.

Over 100 million Americans under frost or freeze alerts,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/weather/freeze-frost-forecast-tuesday/index.html,"Over 100 million Americans under frost or freeze alerts
A wintry air mass will cake decorative pumpkins with frost and put people in the mood for hot apple cider Tuesday and Wednesday.
Freeze warnings, watches and frost advisories are in effect for over 100 million people from eastern Colorado to the Appalachians – and all the way south to the Gulf Coast.
“Many places will experience their first freeze of the season over the next couple of nights, which will be particularly impactful to sensitive crops and livestock,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
“This first freeze is 10-15 days early at most climate stations,” the National Weather Service in Memphis wrote Tuesday morning, “with Memphis’ mean first freeze day being a bit later at Nov 12.”
The prediction center said temperatures will be 15 to 30 degrees below average the next couple of days.
“Widespread high and low temperature records may be tied or broken over Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast today, then over the Central/Southern Appalachians and Florida on Wednesday,” the prediction center said.
The cold will bring snow to portions of the Great Lakes.
Over a foot of snow has already fallen in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan into Wisconsin over the last few days. “Moderate to heavy snow is also expected over portions of northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula today,” the prediction center said.
Cold northwesterly winds on the backside of the storm system will continue to generate lake-effect snow in some areas.
By this weekend, the above normal temperatures in the West will have pushed across the country’s eastern half, bringing a quick end to this early arrival of winter temperatures."
"Climate change exposes lack of US preparedness in defending Arctic Ocean interests, US senator says",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/16/us/climate-change-arctic-us-putin-china-climate/index.html,"Climate change exposes lack of US preparedness in defending Arctic Ocean interests, US senator says
Climate change is unlocking a new crossroads and potential center of conflict: the Arctic. But one key lawmaker is warning the US has lagged behind in securing the region, as other powers move in, adding he believes the Arctic may soon be a stage for a nuclear show of force by Vladimir Putin.
“This new ocean is appearing on our maps, and it has all kinds of different implications,” Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in an interview with CNN. “We’ve been slow to pick up on it, frankly.”
The summertime extent of sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by around 50% since the 1970s. The co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus believes the region’s dramatic change is likely irreversible in the short-term. While King argues the world must do more to confront climate change, a new reality is fast approaching and a global rush is underway, as global powers step in seeking untapped natural resources, like oil and natural gas, and highly coveted shipping routes.
“If you think about the Mediterranean Sea, there were 1,000 years of war to determine the relationships of those countries surrounding (it). The question is can we open the Arctic and avoid the conflict?” he said.
As some scientists predict we could see ice-free summers near the North Pole in the coming decades, King said additional shipping lanes could increase commerce and lead to a huge economic advantage as some routes decrease shipping times by up to 15 days.
“But Russia has a huge border on the Arctic Ocean, which by the way, they’re militarizing the hell out of right now,” he said. “It’s a national security issue for everyone in the United States, whether they’re in Texas or in Minnesota.”
CNN has previously reported on the steady buildup of Russian military bases on the country’s Arctic coastline, which includes the refurbishing of old Soviet installations. The Kremlin allowed CNN a firsthand look at Russia’s northernmost outpost in 2021, vowing its intentions for the region were peaceful.
“Ukraine changed all that,” said King, adding Putin’s expansionist views could soon extend to the Far North. “I don’t think there’s any doubt he’ll stop (in Ukraine) if he’s successful.”
As Ukraine’s counteroffensive gains momentum and Russia’s military suffers setbacks, one of King’s concerns is Putin may resort to using nuclear weapons to reassert dominance.
“He has several options with regard to a tactical nuclear weapon and one of them is a so-called ‘demonstration,’” in the Arctic, King said. “The idea being we’re going to show you what we can do, but we’re not going to kill a ton of people.”
While King, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there has been no intelligence indicating an imminent nuclear test by Putin, he said it remains “one of his options.”
New ‘Arctic strategy’
While King said he applauds the Biden administration’s new “National Strategy for the Arctic Region,” released this month, he said the US must invest more resources to compete.
“I mean Russia has like 40 icebreakers. We have one,” King said, adding Russia is not alone, with nations not geographically close to the North Pole, like China and India, also laying out their Arctic ambitions.
At an Arctic conference in Iceland a few years ago, King said he came across a 40-person delegation from China, where Chinese officials told him Beijing was interested in the region as a “near-Arctic nation.”
“That makes Maine a near-Caribbean state. There’s no geographic relationship. It’s ridiculous,” King said. “But they see the strategic value and the potential economic value.”
King is calling for a stronger naval presence in the Arctic, more robust military infrastructure, and a commitment to international treaties, like the United Nations Law of the Sea, among other steps he believes can deter a future war.
“I think the jury is out on that, but it’s at least possible and I think that’d be positive for America and for the whole world,” he said."
Do you have ‘eco-anxiety’? Here’s how to find out,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/health/eco-anxiety-harmful-for-health-wellness/index.html,"Do you have ‘eco-anxiety’? Here’s how to find out
Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.
We know changes in the weather and seasons can affect mood, causing run-of-the-mill rainy-day blues and seasonal affective disorder. Now, it’s also important to recognize the harmful mental and physical health effects of long-term climate change.
In her book “Taking the Heat: How Climate Change Is Affecting Your Mind, Body, and Spirit and What You Can Do About It,” author and former CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider documents these challenges and shares experts’ advice on how to cope.
Here, she offers insights about the impact of climate on health.
This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
CNN: How can climate change lead to health problems?
Bonnie Schneider: Our environment affects the core drivers of health. Temperature changes, air and water quality, food safety and availability, and even our emotional well-being are tied up with our natural surroundings. Changes to these variables can impact both healthy people and those with preexisting conditions.
Take temperature, for example. Ever tried to sleep in a hot room with no air conditioning? Rising temperatures can disrupt sleep and diminish mental clarity and memory, research has shown.
A study of young, healthy college students showed that those who slept with no AC during a heat wave performed worse on cognitive tests the next day than those in rooms with artificial cooling.
Climate change has been linked to certain types of extreme weather events, including intensified floods, wildfires, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes that last longer and produce more rainfall. In 2021, 20 weather and climate disaster events in the US resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion each.
Overall, natural disasters now happen more frequently, impacting more people.
These can cause burns and smoke inhalation from wildfires, injuries from debris falling, and other kinds of harm. Mental health is impacted, too, whether as fallout from trauma, community loss or being displaced. Research shows these psychological consequences can last for years or even decades.
Also important to mention is that natural disasters can affect mental health, even among those who haven’t been directly impacted. Upheaval in one’s own community can, of course, prompt distress. But just seeing images of weather destruction on TV can trigger anxiety. That’s the case even if the specific weather event is not actually linked to climate change.
CNN: What is “eco-anxiety,” and how pervasive is it?
Schneider: Eco-anxiety refers to the anxiety and fear that people have over climate change and the future of the planet.
Of people ages 16 to 25, 84% expressed at least moderate worry about climate change in 2021 global survey of 10,000 people. More than 56% believed “humanity is doomed,” and more than 45% said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning.
Experts at the Climate Psychiatry Alliance and the Climate Psychology Alliance confirm the genuine struggles that individuals, especially young people, are having with this kind of anxiety. It can cause severe disruption in daily life, intrude upon people’s thoughts and interfere with healthy sleep.
CNN: Do certain medical conditions make people more vulnerable to environmental changes?
Schneider: Yes. Most medical experts say weather extremes of any kind can stress the body. With the climate changing, we’re getting hotter days for a longer period of time. This can lead to troubles for people with certain autoimmune diseases that flare up under particular environmental conditions. Lupus, for example, can be triggered by bright sunlight due to UV ray exposure, according to the medical experts I interviewed.
Some evidence suggests relationships between pain and relative humidity, pressure and wind speed. For those suffering from arthritis, more frequent powerful storms may mean more potential for pain. Yet other data negates these findings, such as the study that found no relation between rainfall and outpatient visits for joint or back pain. Still, even these researchers concede the weather-pain correlation may exist, and they urge additional study.
CNN: What does climate change have to do with infectious disease?
Schneider: The loss of biodiversity has become a huge problem. Even small, subtle shifts and disruptions to the natural habitats of wildlife affect humans. We’re all part of the ecosystem.
In a September 2020 paper written by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. David Morens, the two infectious disease specialists warn that pandemics are occurring more frequently. They call the Covid-19 pandemic “yet another reminder that human activities represent aggressive, damaging, and unbalanced interactions with wildlife and will increasingly provoke new disease emergencies.”
Environmental shifts alter many types of vector-borne diseases – lyme, for example. When temperatures rise, ticks become more of an issue at northern latitudes, which means we could start to see Lyme disease in places where people don’t expect it. This could cause difficulties, given how challenging Lyme can be to diagnose.
Mosquitoes bring additional concerns. More flooding increases their prevalence and the risk of them transmitting diseases.
Then there are the waterborne flesh-eating bacteria.
Rising water temperatures are believed to have brought deadly bacteria to previously unaffected waters. The Vibrio species, for example, can invade the body through any tiny opening in the skin, rapidly causing severe illness and even death.
In June, NOAA scientists in Virginia and Maryland predicted that “as Chesapeake Bay waters warm, Vibrio vulnificus pathogens become more prevalent.” (NOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the US Department of Commerce.)
As of August 5, 23 cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection have been reported in Florida alone – four of them deadly.
Now, we need to add another type of bacteria to our list of concerns.
In 2020 and 2022, two unrelated individuals on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi became sick with melioidosis. This rare and serious infectious disease is caused by direct contact with soil and water contaminated with the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei. The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) now cautions people in the region who have health conditions that may put them at higher risk – such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease or excessive alcohol use – to avoid contact with soil or muddy water, particularly after heavy rains.
CNN: What impact does global warming have on allergies?
Schneider: Allergy season has gotten longer. More frost-free days mean more potentially irritating pollens. There’s also a debate among scientists about whether increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has made pollen more intense.
Molds are other allergens affected by weather, exacerbated by more frequent storms, intense flooding and damp days.
Many asthma attacks are first triggered by allergies, too. Asthma can be triggered by thunderstorms and wildfire smoke. It’s all connected.
CNN: No wonder people are experiencing climate anxiety. What helps them cope?
Schneider: Psychologists and psychiatrists I spoke with emphasized that we can’t scoff at eco-anxiety. It’s rooted in valid concerns, and people are genuinely troubled.
Experts recommend finding a community of like-minded people by joining groups like the “Climate Cafes” organized by the Climate Psychology Alliance, where you can talk about difficult feelings in a safe space held by trained facilitators. Youth-specific organizations provide other opportunities to connect.
For individual counseling, the Climate Psychiatry Alliance has a directory listing “climate aware” therapists.
Taking actions, large and small, helps, too. Experts advise getting involved with climate justice activism through taking part in events like Climate Week NYC, a global gathering in September with more than 500 events worldwide. Even participating in something local like a beach cleanup can ease worries.
Mindfulness meditation and gratitude are other tools for addressing eco-anxiety. On my website, I give instructions for short, simple mindfulness practices.
When it comes to anxiety, nature has therapeutic effects for both adults and children. Gardening or doing something constructive outdoors –  even during cold weather –  can turn a sense of helplessness into agency. In “Taking the Heat,” I outline specific, age-based strategies for children and advice for adults.
Spending time in nature is even healing, interestingly enough, for those who’ve suffered from trauma at the hands of the elements. Researchers have found that humans have an intrinsic desire to connect with the outdoors after a natural disaster. It’s part of the coping process.
For any of us, just 20 or 30 minutes walking or sitting in a place that connects us with nature can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
That decrease is good for mind and body alike.

Heating costs forecast to soar this winter
No matter how you heat your home, the cost of that heat is likely to soar, according to a forecast Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration.
Based on current estimates for fuel prices if, as forecast, there’s a slightly colder winter ahead, the EIA estimates that heating a home with natural gas heating costs will rise about $200 on average, or 28% to $931 for the winter.
Still, that’s not as bad as heating oil costs, which are forecast to jump $1,200, or 27% to $2,354. Electric heating costs could rise $123, or 10%, to $1,359, while propane heating costs are expected to rise $80, or 5%, to $1,688.
Bear in mind that in many cases these increases are on top of even higher percentage increases from a year ago. For example, heating oil costs jumped more than 50% for winter last year. Consumers who use heating oil can expect to pay nearly double what they paid for the winter of 2020-21.
Nearly half of homes nationwide use natural gas to heat their homes, and about 40% use electricity. But 80% of the homes using electric heat are in the South and the West, which require less heat than the Midwest or Northeast. Heating oil is only used in 4% of homes nationwide, with almost all of them in the Northeast.
The cost estimates are based partly upon weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is projecting about a 6% increase in the number of days heating is needed, as weighted by population. If this winter turns out to be colder than expected, the cost of heating could rise significantly.
For example, a winter that is 10% colder than the base case forecast would raise natural gas heating costs by $370, or 51%, rather than the $200 increase in the base case scenario, according to the EIA. But if the winter is 10% less cold than expected, it would save those using gas heat only about $70 off that projected $200 increase.

First flakes of the season appear as cooler temperatures settle in,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/weather/weather-news-fall-temperatures-east-wxn/index.html,"First flakes of the season appear as cooler temperatures settle in
Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.
From frost advisories this morning to a strong cold front expected later this week, the chance of fall showing up is real.
There’s a refreshing crispness to the air, and it looks to get only more pronounced as the week goes on.
Frost advisories were in place this morning across portions of the Appalachians and coastal Maine as temperatures dropped into the 30s.
Temperatures this morning were in the 40s as far south as the Florida Panhandle.
And Maine even had a few reports of their first snow of the season Sunday. More cities could see their first snow later this week.
❄️ First flakes! ❄️ quick snow shower up in Jackman, #maine #mewx pic.twitter.com/z8Og3QUz8V
Yes, hello fall!
As temperatures moderate during the next few days, much of the east will stay right around seasonal norms, but the next blast of cold air will be strong and come with the potential for hazardous conditions.
“A more active fall weather pattern is expected to evolve by the end of this week and continuing into the weekend as a couple of cold fronts move across the central and eastern states,” the Weather Prediction Center said.
The potent cold front will come in from Canada with a punch of chilly air, heavy rain and strong wind.
The Weather Prediction Center has a slight risk of excessive rainfall for much of the Northeast and New England on Thursday, including places like New York City, Buffalo and Burlington, so we will have to look out for flash flooding in these areas.
“More impactful weather continues to look likely with confidence growing that our region will experience the first real fall-like system with gusty to strong winds and a period of moderate to heavy rain along and ahead of a cold front passage,” the National Weather Service office in Burlington wrote.
The potential for very heavy rain could accompany the front, bringing up to two inches of rain for much of the area, and isolated locations could see even more.
“Ensembles [forecast models] show median rainfall totals by Wednesday night around a half inch, with a potential for some spots to see around one inch, our first substantial rainfall in at least a couple of weeks,” the weather service office in Grand Rapids noted, adding, “It may also get cold enough for some snow to mix in Thursday night to Friday morning, especially in the higher terrain north of Grand Rapids toward Cadillac.”
There is also a chance for very strong winds to accompany the system.
The weather service is forecasting winds of 30-40 mph ahead of the cold front, which could cause some tree limbs to fall and sporadic power outages.
Behind the front, temperatures will fall.
“East Coast, with highs about 5-15 degrees below average to close out the workweek and going into next weekend, with highs only in the 40s and 50s from the Great Lakes to the Northeast on most days,” the Weather Prediction Center explained.
By the weekend, a second cold front will drop down from Canada and bring a reinforcing shot of chilly air across the eastern half of the country."
Fourth year in a row of drought is likely in Southwest after worst 3 on record,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/us/california-southwest-drought-outlook-climate/index.html,"Fourth year in a row of drought is likely in Southwest after worst 3 on record
The past three years have been the driest such period on record in California, state officials said this week. The state is now preparing for the increasing probability that it will see a fourth consecutive dry year as it works to conserve water resources as reservoir supplies dwindle.
California’s water year, which ended in September, came with both wet and dry extremes, state climatologist Michael Anderson said during a news briefing early this week. Human-caused climate change has increased the potential for this weather whiplash, where dramatic shifts in between extremely dry periods and high precipitation can occur more frequently – and the phenomenon has been pronounced on the West Coast in recent years.
Anderson said the water year that just ended “certainly meets the narrative of climate change with more extremes and more variability.” Despite an overall improvement in drought conditions in the state, he said reservoir storage is now “slightly better than last year – but still well-below average.”
California has already been holding back water in its reservoirs in anticipation of more dry years to come.  Global scientists reported last year that droughts that may have occurred only once every decade or so now happen 70% more frequently due to the climate crisis.
For the water year that just ended, Jeanine Jones, California’s drought manager, said the state had 76% of its average annual precipitation which lead to better reservoir storage numbers compared with the year before, which was abysmally dry.
“We are now consciously holding over more water in our reservoirs because we are more actively focused on planning for carryover storage for multi-year droughts,” Jones said.
And according to John Abatzoglou, a professor of climatology at University of California at Merced, a dry autumn is what they fear next.
“This would stall any buildup of mountain snowpack that is critical for large water systems in the Southwest and California and compress our window for bending the curve on the current drought in the upcoming water year to mid-to-late winter,” he told CNN.
Back-to-back La Niña
More than 73% of the West is currently in drought conditions, according to the US Drought Monitor. And although summer rainfall brought some relief to parts of the Southwest, the prolonged, multi-year drought there may persist with La Niña in the forecast for the third year in a row, according to the state’s Department of Water Resources.
“The La Niña forecast is about as auspicious for Southwestern drought relief as it was this time in 2020 or in 2021 – meaning not at all,” Justin Mankin, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and co-lead of NOAA’s Drought Task Force, told CNN. “What’s pretty clear is that it is going to be hard to get the type of banner year for rain and snow we need to ameliorate this drought.”
La Niña is a natural phenomenon marked by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean near the equator, which causes shifts in weather across the globe. In the Southwest, La Niña typically causes the jet stream – upper-level winds that carry storms around the globe – to shift northward. That means less rainfall for a region that desperately needs it.
But experts also say that La Niña years can still be highly variable.
“I’d say there is little solid information suggesting that fall will be dry or wet as the La Niña signal tends to be a bit more pronounced in mid- to late winter, hence my general guidance would be for drought to persist,” Abatzoglou said. “Although, the deeper we go into fall or winter without meaningful precipitation and snowpack, the more drought is ratcheted up.”
Mankin said that in general, a La Niña year is “a harbinger of a dry winter” – and that forecast comes at a crucial time for Western states as they attempt to negotiate huge cuts in water usage, particularly from the Colorado River.
US Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton has called for Western states to come up with a plan to slash 2 to 4 million acre-feet of Colorado River water usage to protect the system from collapsing. States are still negotiating a voluntary agreement, but talks have been contentious and it’s unclear if or when they will produce a result that meets Touton’s goal.
“Water districts, farmers, ranchers and municipalities have been in a protracted crisis for about 34 months, stressing drought management and mitigation resources,” Mankin said. “Our largest reservoirs, Powell and Mead, are failing to perform their basic functions of hydropower and water supply, and none of the states sharing the water from the Colorado River, the most important basin in West, appear willing to restructure their allocations in the way the climate system is asking them to. So it doesn’t bode well.”
Jones said the state is planning for the drought to continue since it is impossible to know whether this new water year will be wet or dry. She added that this is necessary since the state is “on a trajectory toward warmer and drier conditions.”
“California is known for its wide variability in precipitation from year to year,” said Jones. “We should always be thinking about planning for a year in which we might see some very wet extremes or … another dry year.”
As the climate crisis advances, experts say the West will only continue to see more droughts like the present one in the years to come – and only rapid, immediate cuts to planet-heating emissions can halt this harsh trend.
“Whether these La Niñas have been bad luck or a response to climate change is less important than the fact that this drought has both been made worse by climate change and has revealed how poorly adapted we are to the climate we have,” Mankin said.
One thing is certain, he adds: “Another year of drought could potentially bring new frightening realities.”

Western governors sign agreement to tackle climate crisis and transition to clean energy,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/us/west-governors-california-climate-agreement/index.html,"Western governors sign agreement to tackle climate crisis and transition to clean energy
A coalition of West Coast states and British Columbia have pledged to work together as a region to combat climate change and accelerate the transition to clean energy.
The governors of California, Oregon, Washington and the premier of British Columbia gathered in San Francisco Thursday to sign an agreement to decarbonize the electric grid, speed the transition to electric vehicles and make their communities more resilient to climate disasters including drought, wildfire, sea-level rise and extreme heat.
“We’re demonstrating that regional collaboration does make a difference,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Thursday. “We’re demonstrating we’re much more powerful and impactful working together than working alone.”
California and other states have recently taken steps to ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and passed millions in funding to speed the transition to clean energy. Washington state lawmakers also recently passed a package to decarbonize the state’s transportation sector, which will add thousands of new EV charging stations and transition its ferries to hybrid-electric.
Those actions and Thursday’s agreement come as western North America has struggled with some of the most intense and prolonged impacts from the climate crisis.
In September, a heat wave settled over the region which was unprecedented for its extreme temperatures and for its duration. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the September heat wave was “10 days of a heat dome the likes of which we couldn’t even imagine.”
It happened as California ended its third year in a row of intense drought as major reservoir levels are crashing. Western states – including California – are now negotiating a deal to cut a huge amount of their Colorado River water usage to save the river basin from spiraling into crisis.
“Is that the exception or is that the new normal?” Newsom said of California’s drought. “Lake Mead, Powell – all of us fighting over each other with what we’re going to do with just the Colorado River.”
The human-caused climate crisis is amplifying extreme weather in the West, climate experts have told CNN, making extreme heat and drought more intense and frequent.
Thursday’s statement of cooperation calls for the states to follow seven guiding principles. They include ensuring the clean energy transition is equitable and doesn’t leave communities behind, making sure buildings are resilient to climate disasters, lowering the cost of energy, engaging with Native tribes and Indigenous people and using natural resources and land to store carbon.
The statement also promises to serve as a model for other regions “to demonstrate how the West Coast is building the thriving low-carbon and climate-resilient economy of the future.”
Newsom said the region’s leaders want to demonstrate they are at the forefront of the clean energy transition and are fully embracing electric vehicles and other new technologies.
“It’s the West Coast offense, not defense,” Newsom said. “We’re showing how it can be done. This is not about electric power; this is about economic power. This is about dominating the next big global industry.”"
Northern Hemisphere’s extreme summer drought ‘virtually impossible’ without human-made climate change,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/world/northern-hemisphere-drought-climate-intl/index.html,"Northern Hemisphere’s extreme summer drought ‘virtually impossible’ without human-made climate change
Drought across the Northern Hemisphere this summer — which scorched soil, dried up rivers and triggered mass crop failure — was made at least 20 times more likely by the climate crisis, a new analysis has found.
The research, published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution initiative, found that without the climate crisis, the drought that hit swaths of North America, Asia and Europe this summer would historically be a 1-in-400-year event — meaning it was a drought that was so intense, it would only be seen once every 400 years on average.
But global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels has made a drought of this magnitude a 1-in-20-year occurrence, the scientists found.
The soaring temperatures experienced this summer, which contributed to the drought and killed tens of thousands of people across Europe and China, would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, the analysis also found.
The researchers used historical data, observations and scientific modeling, comparing conditions under today’s climate — which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization — with  the climate that preceded it, before the late 1800s.
“The 2022 Northern Hemisphere summer is a good example of how extreme events caused by climate change can also unfold over large regions in longer periods of time. It also shows how the combination of many different changes in the weather can damage our infrastructure and overburden our social systems,” Freiderike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study’s authors, said in a statement.
“In Europe, drought conditions led to reduced harvests. This was particularly worrying, as it followed a climate change-fueled heatwave in South Asia that also destroyed crops, and happened at a time when global food prices were already extremely high due to the war in Ukraine.”
While much of the hemisphere experienced below-average rainfall this year, the analysis found that increasing temperatures was the main driver behind the drought.
The scientists also noted their findings were conservative, and “the real influence of human activities is likely higher” than stated in the report.
Across the Northern Hemisphere this summer, extreme heat and low rainfall led to several unprecedented events: China issued its first-ever a national drought alert; the United Kingdom recorded its highest-ever temperature; Europe experienced its hottest summer; and the water crisis in the US West intensified, prompting new water usage cuts.
Alongside the immediate danger to life, the summer’s extreme heat posed severe threats to infrastructure, industry and food supply, fueling the ongoing cost of living crisis in many of the affected regions.
Europe was already battling geopolitical shocks to supply. This climate-induced shock has further “aggravated the cost of living crisis, compounding the impacts of the Ukraine war,” said Maarten van Aalst, another of the report’s authors and Director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center.
“We are witnessing the fingerprint of climate change not just in specific hazards,” van Aalst said “but also in the cascading of impacts across sectors and regions.”
What’s to come
Scientists are increasingly able to quantify the link between the climate crisis and extreme weather events. They can also more accurately make projections.
The Northern Hemisphere can expect extreme temperatures — like those experienced this summer — much more frequently, the analysis found.
“This result also gives us an insight on what is looming ahead,” said Dominik Schumacher, a researcher at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich. “With further global warming we can expect stronger and more frequent summer droughts in the future.”
In this case, the water shortages, wildfires, crop failures, higher food prices and depleted electricity supply experienced over the past few months may become commonplace.
The study follows not only a summer of extreme weather but also a destructive hurricane and typhoon season. The death toll from Hurricane Ian in the US had surpassed 100. Typhoon Noru ripped across the Philippines recently, after rapidly intensifying from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 in around six hours.
In November, world leaders will meet in Egypt for COP27, the UN Climate Change Conference, where extreme weather events this year will likely add to the urgency of discussions.
Sonia Seneviratne, also a professor at ETH Zurich, said: “We need to phase-out the burning of fossil fuels if we want to stabilize climate conditions and avoid a further worsening of these drought events, which will become more frequent and more intense with any additional increase of global warming.”"
Some Chinese cities break October heat records as others shiver,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/asia/china-drought-cold-weather-october-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Some Chinese cities break October heat records as others shiver
China is facing extreme weather as scorching heat breaks records in some drought-stricken parts of the country, while cool weather sweeps through other regions as the climate crisis makes conditions more unstable.
In the south, dozens of drought alerts have been issued for cities and counties in Jiangxi province, warning that crops could suffer from the worst drought conditions in 50 years.
Further north, Qingyang city in Gansu province reached 40.9 degrees Celsius (105 Fahrenheit) on Monday, shattering the national heat record for October, at a time when  temperatures typically average about 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit), according to weather service Ogimet.
The southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian also set new record heat for October.
“It’s truly abnormal, nobody has experienced this kind of record-breaking temperatures in October,” said Fang Keyan, a climate scientist at Fujian Normal University.
Fang said seasonal weather transitions are becoming more complicated to estimate because atmospheric circulations were being disrupted by rising global temperatures amid the climate crisis.
While parts of the country swelter, some regions may see early snowfall this year.
The National Meteorological Center (NMC) issued its earliest national cold wave warning on Sunday, with cold air sweeping the north and central regions of the country. It was lifted three days later by the China Meteorological Observatory.
The cold air has cooled parts of northern China, with national weather agencies warning that temperatures could hover around 12 degrees Celsius (53 Fahrenheit) in central parts of the country.
Moderate snow and sleet is projected to fall across northern areas of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang in the coming days, according to the NMC’s forecast.
Fang said dramatic fluctuations in temperature nationwide were particularly harmful for farming as crops cannot withstand the prolonged hot and dry summer, while a sudden cold spell also slows the metabolic growth of plants.
“This for sure reduces the production of crops and will be very bad for the ecosystem because forests in the subtropical region usually have peaks of growth in the summer and autumn,” he said.
A season of extremes
China has endured a summer of extreme weather this year, with hundreds of thousands affected by the heaviest rainfall in 60 years, followed by a devastating heat wave that dried rivers and killed thousands of livestock.
Torrential rains lashed the south of the country from April to June, causing heavy flooding and landslides, which was followed by a heat wave that spread across central and southern China from mid-June to late August.
The extreme heat triggered a power crunch, prompting authorities to dim office lighting, shut factories and cut electricity from homes, forcing air conditioners to be switched off.
The persistent heat wave that stretched into October was caused by a subtropical high, according to the NMC, with temperatures in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River already shattering records.
“Before the cold air reaches southern China, more places in this region will continue to swelter through extended heat, with the highest temperatures likely to keep rising, and possibly breaking more records,” Zhang Tao, an NMC meteorologist told a media briefing on Saturday.

Australia commits to zero extinctions with new plan to protect 30% of land,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/asia/australia-threatened-species-plan-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Australia commits to zero extinctions with new plan to protect 30% of land
Australia, which has one of the world’s worst records on extinctions, on Tuesday announced a 10-year plan to prevent any more species from dying out in the country by protecting its most threatened plants and animals.
Launching the plan at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia’s Minister for the Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek said the Labor government had a “very ambitious target” to conserve more than 30% of Australia’s land mass by 2030.
“We’re talking about an extra 50 million hectares (about 124,000 acres) of landscape that we need to find and to manage in a way that protects the landscape and the species that depend on it,” Plibersek said.
The plan brings Australia into line with more than 100 other countries, including the United States, which have pledged to protect 30% of their land and 30% of their ocean by 2030. The initial coalition of countries announced their commitment ahead of the One Planet summit in 2021.
In recent years, Australia’s wildlife has suffered due to natural disasters, land clearing, feral predators and the effects of the climate crisis, including the “Black Summer” fires that tore across southern states in 2019-20, killing or displacing nearly 3 billion animals, according to estimates from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
The fires contributed to the bleak outlook for Australian biodiversity detailed in the State of the Environment 2021 report. Belatedly released this July, the report found that Australia had lost more mammal species than any other continent and “continues to have one of the highest rates of species decline among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.”
The previous Coalition government had opted not to release the report ahead of the federal election in May, with some speculating that its contents were so alarming that the government worried it could cost them votes. They lost the election anyway, which saw a higher number of environmental advocates win seats across the country.
What’s in the plan
The new plan identifies 20 places and 110 species that will become the focus of conservation efforts.
The government says the priority species were selected based on several factors, including their uniqueness and risk of extinction, while the priority places represent a “broad range of Australian landscapes and ecosystems.” The areas include the forests of Far North Queensland, Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.
“By focusing in on these species and these places, we have the biggest chance of success,” Plibersek said.
The World Wildlife Fund Australia’s Chief Conservation Officer, Rachel Lowry, applauded the government’s commitment to Australia’s threatened species but said the plan should go further.
“Australia has more than 1,900 listed threatened species. This plan picks 110 winners. It’s unclear how it will help our other ‘non priority’ threatened species such as our endangered greater glider for example,” Lowry said in a statement.
The Australian Conservation Foundation’s nature program manager, Basha Stasak, said “stopping the destruction of wildlife habitat is the key” to achieving the government’s goal of no new extinctions.
Stasak added that the government’s plan is “ambitious but essential if future generations of Australians are to see animals like koalas, mountain pygmy possums, greater gliders and gang-gang cockatoos,” all of which are listed as endangered or vulnerable species.
The plan also includes continued emphasis on “actions that can most benefit threatened species,” such as minimizing the impact of threats like feral cats and foxes, getting the community involved in and leading recovery efforts, and helping priority species adapt to climate change so they ultimately become more resilient.
Feral predators introduced by settlers during colonization have multiplied and played an outsized role in Australia’s environmental degradation.
A recent study published in the journal Diversity and Distributions estimated that foxes and cats kill almost 700 million reptiles, 510 million birds and 1.4 billion mammals every year in Australia."
This 100% solar community endured Hurricane Ian with no loss of power and minimal damage,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/us/solar-babcock-ranch-florida-hurricane-ian-climate/index.html,"This 100% solar community endured Hurricane Ian with no loss of power and minimal damage
Anthony Grande moved away from Fort Myers three years ago in large part because of the hurricane risk. He has lived in southwest Florida for nearly 19 years, had experienced Hurricanes Charley in 2004 and Irma in 2017 and saw what stronger storms could do to the coast.
Grande told CNN he wanted to find a new home where developers prioritized climate resiliency in a state that is increasingly vulnerable to record-breaking storm surge, catastrophic wind and historic rainfall.
What he found was Babcock Ranch — only 12 miles northeast of Fort Myers, yet seemingly light years away.
Babcock Ranch calls itself “America’s first solar-powered town.” Its nearby solar array — made up of 700,000 individual panels — generates more electricity than the 2,000-home neighborhood uses, in a state where most electricity is generated by burning natural gas, a planet-warming fossil fuel.
The streets in this meticulously planned neighborhood were designed to flood so houses don’t. Native landscaping along roads helps control storm water. Power and internet lines are buried to avoid wind damage. This is all in addition to being built to Florida’s robust building codes.
Some residents, like Grande, installed more solar panels on their roofs and added battery systems as an extra layer of protection from power outages. Many drive electric vehicles, taking full advantage of solar energy in the Sunshine State.
Climate resiliency was built into the fabric of the town with stronger storms in mind.
So when Hurricane Ian came barreling toward southwest Florida this week, it was a true test for the community. The storm obliterated the nearby Fort Myers and Naples areas with record-breaking surge and winds over 100 mph. It knocked out power to more than 2.6 million customers in the state, including 90% of Charlotte County.
But the lights stayed on in Babcock Ranch.
“It certainly exceeded our expectations of a major hurricane,” Grande, 58, told CNN.
Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter.
The storm uprooted trees and tore shingles from roofs, but other than that Grande said there is no major damage. Its residents say Babcock Ranch is proof that an eco-conscious and solar-powered town can withstand the wrath of a near-Category 5 storm.
“We have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,” Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. “We have water, electricity, internet — and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.”
Grande said Hurricane Ian came through southwest Florida “like a freight train.” But he wasn’t afraid that he would lose everything in a storm, like he was when he lived in Fort Myers.
“We’re very, very blessed and fortunate to not be experiencing what they’re experiencing now in Sanibel Island and Fort Myers Beach,” Grande said. “In the times that we’re living in right now with climate change, the beach is not the place to live or have a business.”
Solar success
Syd Kitson, a former professional football player for the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, is the mastermind behind Babcock Ranch. Kitson envisioned it to be an eco-conscious and innovative neighborhood that is safe and resilient from storms like Ian.
The ranch broke ground in 2015 with the construction of the solar array — which was built and is run by Florida Power and Light — and its first residents moved into the town in 2018. Since then, the array has doubled in size and thousands of people have made Babcock their home.
“It’s a great case study to show that it can be done right, if you build in the right place and do it the right way,” said Lisa Hall, a spokesperson for Kitson, who also lives in Babcock Ranch.
“Throughout all this, there’s just so many people saying, ‘it worked, that this was the vision, this is the reason we moved here,’” Hall told CNN.
Perhaps the highest endorsement for the city is that it is now a refuge for some of Ian’s hardest-hit victims. The state opened Babcock Neighborhood School as an official shelter, even though it didn’t have the mandated generator. The solar array kept the lights on.
Some of Chorpenning’s friends who live on Sanibel Island — which is now cut off from the mainland after Ian’s devastating storm surge severed the causeway — came to shelter at a friend’s house at Babcock Ranch. It will be a while before they can go back, she said.
“They’re going to be renting a place over here for a while, while they figure out what’s going to happen out there,” she said. “I joked that we may be the only people in southwest Florida whose property value just increased.”
Even Kitson chose to ride out the storm in Babcock to see how the community would fare in the hurricane. Kitson declined CNN’s request for an interview; Hall said he is focused on helping neighboring communities rebuild.
“He was there during the storm; he said, ‘where else would I be?’” Hall said. “We built it to be resilient and as much as you plan and think you’ve done the right thing, you don’t know until you put it to the test.”
As utilities scramble to restore power across the state, Babcock residents say September storms showed that America’s energy infrastructure is not well-equipped to handle worsening extreme weather events. Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico’s power grid when it made landfall there on September 18. Now, Ian has left millions of people in the dark in Florida.
Babcock residents say their neighborhood is a model for urban development in a climate change-ravaged future.
“It’s not what it was 20 or 25 years ago; the storms are getting bigger and bigger, and it’s no surprise, because the warnings have all been there,” Grande said. “I think Babcock Ranch’s future has gotten even brighter.”"
"King Charles drops plan to attend climate summit after government asks him not to, UK media reports",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/uk/uk-charles-climate-cop27-gbr-intl/index.html,"King Charles drops plan to attend climate summit after government asks him not to, UK media reports
King Charles III will miss the upcoming COP27 climate change summit in Egypt, CNN understands, after British media reported that Prime Minister Liz Truss advised him to drop his plans to attend.
CNN understands that the King’s attendance at COP27 had not been confirmed and following consultations with the government, there was a joint agreement that this would not be the right occasion for Charles’s first overseas visit as a sovereign.
CNN has reached out to Buckingham Palace for official comment.
King Charles attended the climate change conference as Prince of Wales in 2021. COP27 is due to take place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in November 2022.
Prince of Wales, Prince William, will also not be attending the climate change summit, according to Kensington Palace.
Charles has been an advocate of environmental causes for at least five decades. He was a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the subject with Donald Trump in December 2019, as the then-president prepared to pull the United States out of the pact.
The following month, at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Charles gave a powerful speech, asking: “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance when we could have done? I don’t want to.”
Despite criticism – and at times ridicule – over his fight to be the royals’ ecowarrior, Charles has continued to be a pioneer in green issues in recent years.
Divisive figure
Charles was in his element at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November 2021, where he implored countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change.
“We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,” he said at the time. Climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat them, he added.
US President Joe Biden commented on Charles’ decades-long efforts at the event, paying him the ultimate compliment by saying he’d got “the whole thing going” and “that’s how it all started.”
Charles has been outspoken on a whole range of sensitive issues from genetically modified crops to homeopathic medicines and architecture. It’s made him a more divisive figure than his mother, who barely cracked an expression during her reign, let alone expressed an opinion. Elizabeth’s legendary ability not to offend and alienate was more strategic than many realize, but Charles has always insisted he intends to follow her lead and stop meddling when he takes the throne.
In 2018, Charles said to the BBC: “The idea, somehow, that I’m going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two – the two situations – are completely different.” When specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.”

Noru became a super typhoon in 6 hours. Scientists say powerful storms are becoming harder to forecast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/01/asia/philippines-super-typhoon-noru-karding-climate-intl-dst-hnk/index.html,"Noru became a super typhoon in 6 hours. Scientists say powerful storms are becoming harder to forecast
Residents on the small resort island of Polillo are accustomed to severe weather – their island sits in the northeastern Philippines, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean where storms typically gather strength and turn into typhoons.
But even they were stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru, known locally as Typhoon Karding, that turned from a typhoon into a super typhoon in just six hours before hitting the region earlier this week.
“We’re used to typhoons because we’re located where storms usually land,” said Armiel Azas Azul, 36, who owns the Sugod Beach and Food Park on the island, a bistro under palm trees where guests drink coconut juice in tiny thatched huts.
“But everything is very unpredictable,” he said. “And (Noru) came very fast.”
The Philippines sees an average of 20 tropical storms each year, and while Noru didn’t inflict as much damage or loss of life as other typhoons in recent years, it stood out because it gained strength so quickly.
Experts say rapidly developing typhoons are set to become much more common as the climate crisis fuels extreme weather events, and at the same time it will become harder to predict which storms will intensify and where they will track.
“The challenge is accurately forecasting the intensity and how fast the categories may change, for example from just a low-pressure area intensifying into a tropical cyclone,” said Lourdes Tibig, a meteorologist and climatologist with the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities.
The same happened in the United States last week when Hurricane Ian turned from a Category 1 storm into a powerful Category 4 hurricane before making landfall along the southwestern coast of Florida on Wednesday.
Such rapid intensification, as it’s known in meteorological terms, creates challenges for residents, authorities and local emergency workers, including those in the Philippines, who increasingly have no choice but to prepare for the worst.
From storm to super typhoon
When Azul received warning that Typhoon Noru was approaching the Philippines last Saturday, he began his usual preparations of setting up his generator and tying down loose items.
At that stage, Noru was predicted to make landfall on Sunday as the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane.
But as the storm grew closer, it strengthened into a super typhoon, the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, making landfall Sunday evening with ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline.
Azul said his community was fortunate to have TV signal in the resort, and as soon as they found out that the typhoon was much stronger than forecast, his staff brought in all the bistro’s outdoor furniture and tied down the roofs of their guesthouses, while local government units evacuated people living near the shore.
“But other parts of the island which don’t have internet connectivity and only rely on radio signals might not have got the message in time,” he said.
The typhoon damaged the resort town, as strong winds toppled beach huts and damaged nearby fishing cages.
Azul added that coconut trees planted across the island about a decade ago after Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) battered the area had just started to bear fruit but were now completely wiped out.
“We have to pick up the pieces, and rebuild again,” he said.
On the main island of Luzon, Noru left a trail of destruction in the province of Nueva Ecija, known as the “rice granary” of the country.
Ruel Ladrido, 46, a farmer owner in Laur, Nueva Ecija, said his rice fields were not flooded but strong winds damaged his crops.
“It didn’t rain hard near me, but the winds uprooted some of my fields. It will affect our harvest this season, but what can we do? I don’t know the extent of the damage yet, but we’ll have to plant again,” he told CNN on Tuesday.
As of Friday, 12 people had died in the aftermath of Noru, including five rescue workers in Bulacan province, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).
The estimated damage to agriculture ballooned to some 3 billion Philippine pesos (about $51 million), affected 104,500 farmers and fisher folk, and damaged over 166,630 thousand hectares of crop land, according to the NDRRMC.
Harder to predict
The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, is already vulnerable to typhoons, but as sea levels rise and ocean temperatures warm, the storms expected to become more powerful, according to research published in 2018.
The study found that the stronger typhoons carry more moisture and track differently. They are also “aggravated by sea level rise, one of the most certain consequences of climate change.”
A separate study published last year, by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, found that typhoons in east and southeast Asia now last between two and nine hours longer and travel an average of 100 kilometers (62 miles) further inland than they did four decades ago. By the end of the century, they could have double the destructive power.
As such, it’ll become more difficult to forecast their track and predict ones that will quickly gain strength, or undergo rapid intensification – defined as when wind speeds increase by at least 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour) in 24 hours or less.
Although rare, the Philippines is no stranger to this phenomenon as 28% of all tropical cyclones that made landfall in the country dating back to 1951 underwent rapid intensification based on official data, according to Gerry Bagtasa, a professor with the University of the Philippines’ Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology.
Bagtasa said factors such as high moisture, warm ocean surface temperatures and low wind shear determine the scale of rapid intensification, but those weather readings “don’t have to be extraordinary in their values” to create rapid intensification.
He remarked that Typhoon Noru’s track across the Philippine Sea before making landfall was “just average for this season” and the wind shear – or the change of wind speed and strength with height in the atmosphere – was not extraordinarily low.
Bagtasa also said forecasters find it difficult to predict rapid intensification in the Pacific, because even though satellite monitoring has improved, there isn’t enough data to forecast worsening weather events.
“There are also many unprecedented events happening recently worldwide, and since forecasters typically rely on their past experiences, new events can ‘throw off’ forecasts, so to speak,” he said.
Always bracing for the worst
Mirian Abadilla, a doctor and municipal health officer in Cabangan, Zambales province, on the Philippine island of Luzon, has been involved in her community’s disaster management response since 1991.
She says in that time, typhoons have become harder to forecast, and her community has no choice but to prepare for the worst.
“The typhoons are definitely getting stronger because of climate change, and getting harder to predict,” she said. “But each time we get hit with a typhoon, we try to keep improving our disaster response – that’s the only way for us to stay alert.”
She said local governments held meetings as Typhoon Noru approached the coast to go over relief and rescue plans.
“Filipinos are getting better at disaster preparedness … because we have to be,” she said.
Every province, city, municipality and barangay in the Philippines is required to follow national disaster risk reduction and management system under an act imposed in 2010 to address the island nation’s climate vulnerability.
Local governments must conduct preemptive evacuation based on the projected warnings from the national weather department, and it’s recommended they hold regular disaster rescue drills with responders and host briefing seminars for communities.
In a press briefing on Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. praised local government units for “doing a good job” in explaining the situation to the local population as Noru approached, and for carrying out evacuations that may have prevented mass casualties.
But he also seemed to acknowledge the unpredictability of the storms that regularly threaten the Philippine coast, and the need to always be prepared.
“I think we may have gotten lucky at least this time, a little bit,” Marcos Jr. said.

"Hurricane Ian’s rainfall was a 1-in-1,000 year event for the hardest-hit parts of Florida",https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/weather/hurricane-ian-1000-year-rainfall-climate/index.html,"Hurricane Ian’s rainfall was a 1-in-1,000 year event for the hardest-hit parts of Florida
Hurricane Ian slammed into the Gulf Coast of Florida on Wednesday with record-breaking storm surge and devastating winds. But as it tracked inland, extreme rainfall became the most destructive aspect of the storm for central Florida.
Radar estimates suggest well over 12 inches of rain fell in just 12 to 24 hours in a wide swath from Port Charlotte to Orlando. In some of the hardest-hit locations, Hurricane Ian produced 1-in-1,000-year rainfall, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Live updates: Rescuers pull victims from roofs
A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.
Locations in Florida that experienced a 1,000-year rainfall event from Ian:
Several other locations likely experienced 1,000-year flood events based on radar estimates, including Winter Park (12 inches in 12 hours); North Port (14 inches in 12 hours); and Myakka City (14 inches in 12 hours).
10% wetter
Hurricane Ian’s rainfall was at least 10% wetter because of climate change, according to a rapid analysis released Thursday by scientists at Stony Brook University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The analysis used the same methodology as a recent peer-reviewed study that looked at the influence of climate change on the 2020 hurricane season.
Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley who ran the analysis, noted that the physical relationship between air temperature and water vapor would suggest that Hurricane Ian’s rainfall should have only been around 5% higher due to climate warming.
“This means that the storms are more efficient at precipitating the available moisture,” Wehner said in a statement. He also cautioned that their result is a “conservative estimate.”
“Climate change didn’t cause the storm but it did cause it to be wetter,” Wehner said.
Stronger storms
Scientists are very confident that climate change is increasing rainfall rates – how hard the rain is falling – and the amount of rain a storm can produce.
It’s also making storms stronger and pushing them to intensify faster. Hurricane Ian strengthened rapidly Wednesday morning as it approached Florida. The storm’s maximum wind speed increased by 35 mph in less than three hours, going from a Category 3 to a strong Category 4 in the process.
Despite being squarely in hurricane territory, major hurricanes – Category 3 or stronger – are uncommon for this part of Florida. When Hurricane Ian made landfall Wednesday with maximum winds of 150 mph, it tied 2004’s Hurricane Charley as the strongest storm to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.
This rapid intensification – a hurricane’s winds strengthening rapidly over a short amount of time – is something scientists say is historically rare but is becoming more likely as ocean temperatures increase, giving hurricanes more fuel to strengthen.
“Climate change is increasing both the maximum intensity that these storms can achieve, and the rate of intensification that can bring them to this maximum,” Jim Kossin, a senior scientist at the Climate Service, previously told CNN. Kossin noted that Hurricane Ian, which rapidly intensified before hitting Cuba and before landfall in Florida, was a good example “of very rapid intensification, and there have been many others recently.”
Higher storm surge
Storm surge is generated mainly by the hurricane’s strong winds, which blow from the ocean toward land and push huge amounts of water beyond the coast.
And although hurricanes are rated based on their wind speeds, storm surge is their most deadly aspect. Around 90% of hurricane-related deaths are water-related, according to the National Hurricane Center, and around 50% are caused by storm surges.
In the region south of Hurricane Ian’s eye – including the Ft. Myers and Naples areas – storm surge swelled to record levels. In Naples, water levels climbed 2 feet above record level early Wednesday afternoon before the gauge stopped working.
Collier County Commissioner Rick Locastro told CNN that his county, which includes Marco Island and Naples, was hit hard by storm surge, calling Hurricane Ian “a totally different hurricane.”
“We survived Irma and other hurricanes, which were more about the wind and yes, always water. But storm surge is something that we have not seen here to this intensity ever,” Locastro said. “We experienced every inch of that storm surge, in some areas well over 12 feet.”
A sea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland a hurricane’s surge can travel. Since 1880 – before the industrial revolution and widespread burning of fossil fuels – global sea level has risen on average 8 to 9 inches. Two-thirds of that increase has occurred in just the last two and a half decades, driven mainly by the rapid melting of the world’s ice sheets and glaciers.

Hurricane Ian’s rapid intensification is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/weather/hurricane-rapid-intensification-ian-noru-climate/index.html,"Hurricane Ian’s rapid intensification is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms
Hurricane Ian strengthened rapidly Wednesday morning as it churned over the ultra-warm water of the Gulf of Mexico on its way toward Florida. The storm’s maximum wind speed increased by 35 mph in wind speed in less than three hours, going from a category 3 to a strong category 4 in the process.
Ian’s rapid intensification – the second time it has done so – is something scientists say is becoming more likely for hurricanes as the climate crisis advances, pushing ocean temperatures higher and laying the groundwork for them to explode at breakneck pace into deadly major hurricanes.
Rapid intensification is precisely what it sounds like – a hurricane’s winds strengthening rapidly over a short amount of time. Scientists have defined it as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less. And it has historically been a rare phenomenon, according to Allison Wing, an assistant professor of atmospheric science at Florida State University.
It “is really sort of at the extreme end of how quickly storms can intensify,” Wing told CNN. “Only something like 6% or so of all forecast time periods have those types of rapid intensification rates observed associated with them. And so it’s something that’s by definition, a rare event. Sometimes it only happens a few times per season.”
Live updates: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian
But human-caused climate change is stacking the deck in favor of more intense storms. So not only are they generating more rainfall and larger storm surge – they are also more likely to be stronger and are intensifying faster.
“Climate change is increasing both the maximum intensity that these storms can achieve, and the rate of intensification that can bring them to this maximum,” said Jim Kossin, a senior scientist at the Climate Service. “The intensification rates in Noru and Ian are good examples of very rapid intensification, and there have been many others recently.”
The phenomenon played out with breathtaking speed in the Philippines this weekend. Super Typhoon Noru exploded in strength on its final approach toward the Pacific island nation, going from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept.
Noru’s rapid intensification right before landfall – which was not predicted – likely meant locals had no time prepare for the much stronger storm. Hurricane Ian’s has been in the forecast for days, giving Cuba and Florida the benefit of time.
Two ingredients must come together for rapid intensification to occur, Kossin told CNN. The first is that upper-level winds around the hurricane need to be weak – strong winds can prevent a storm from intensifying or even tear a storm apart.
The second is that warm ocean water must extend well below the surface, going hundreds of feet deep, to provide enough fuel for the hurricane to strengthen.
More than 90% of global warming over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The past five years have been the warmest on record for the world’s oceans.
Scientists have shown humans are the dominant cause of the relentless warming trend. Planet-warming emissions from fossil fuels trap heat in the atmosphere, creating an energy imbalance. The oceans, in turn, absorb 90% of the excess heat, which has led to an alarming increase in temperature.
And much of that warming has happened in the top levels of the ocean where hurricanes get their energy, said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist at Yale Climate Connections.
“Hurricanes and typhoons are heat engines, which means they take heat energy from the oceans and convert it to the kinetic energy that are winds,” Masters told CNN. “So if you increase the amount of heat energy in the ocean by warming it up, you’re going to increase not only the maximum intensity they can get, but also the rate at which they get to that maximum intensity.”
A 2019 study found that Atlantic hurricanes in particular showed a “highly unusual” increase in rapid intensification from the 1980s to the early 2000s – a trend that could only be explained by human-caused climate change. And, concerningly, scientists found that the most significant changes were happening to the strongest storms, making the most life-threatening hurricanes even more dangerous.
“Climate change increases the odds that you’ll get a rapid intensifier,” Masters said.
Some of the United States’ most devastating recent hurricanes were ones that rapidly intensified right before landfall – something Hurricane Ian is not expected to do. Most recently, Hurricane Ida in 2021 strengthened from a category 1 to a strong category 4 in the 24 hours before it made landfall in Louisiana and left a trail of destruction in its wake from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast.
Forecasters are getting better at seeing the signs of this phenomenon before it happens, though, which gives people along the coast more time to prepare for the worst.
Kossin said there are several reasons for this. One is that meteorologists are becoming more confident in the computer forecast models, which are improving at seemingly light speed. The other is that they have seen more extreme cases of rapid intensification in recent years, which makes it easier to forecast them in the future.
Masters told CNN it all adds up to better forecasts.
“The forecasts are unprecedented primarily because the [National] Hurricane Center is getting better at doing their job,” Masters said. Weather models “have gotten so much better. And our techniques for forecasting are getting better.”

Our pets are part of the climate problem. These tips can help you minimize their carbon pawprints,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/us/pets-climate-impact-lbg-wellness/index.html,"Our pets are part of the climate problem. These tips can help you minimize their carbon pawprints
Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.
Our four-legged friends don’t drive gas-guzzling SUVs or use energy-sucking appliances, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a climate impact. In fact, researchers have showed that pets play a significant role in the climate crisis.
But what do Barkley and Whiskers have to do with our warming planet? It’s the products we buy for them that need a closer look.
Their meat-heavy diet is the biggest contributor to their carbon pawprints, which requires an abundance of energy, land and water to produce. And the production of pet food emits huge amounts of planet-warming gases.
According to a 2017 study, feeding dogs and cats creates the equivalent of around 64 million tons of carbon dioxide in the US each year. That’s roughly the same impact as 13.6 million cars on the road. And, if our furry friends formed a separate country, it would rank 5th in global meat consumption behind China, the US, Brazil and Russia, according to UCLA professor and author of that study Gregory Okin.
But don’t panic. Bidding farewell to your best friends is not the answer.
In addition to all the joy they bring, pets have a measurable positive impact on our physical health and mental wellbeing. Having a pet in the family is associated with lower stress, fewer heart attacks, lower rates of depression and increased self-esteem.
“Our work does not mean we are ‘against’ keeping pets,” said Pim Martens, a professor of Sustainable Development at Maastricht University and someone who has researched the impact of pets on the planet. “There are lots of benefits as well. Just be aware of the ‘side-effects.’”
So, what’s a concerned pet parent to do? Here are some ways to minimize your pets’ environmental impact while still caring for your furry fleet.
Do an assessment of your pet’s diet
First, and most importantly — responsible owners considering making significant changes to their pet’s diet should discuss it with their veterinarian to make sure it’s right for their animal’s needs.
In fact, if you’re the proud owner of a feline, you shouldn’t even think about switching their diet. Cats are obligate carnivores — they must eat meat, according to Angela Frimberger, a veterinarian with Vets for Climate Action.
Dogs, on the other hand, are omnivores and don’t necessarily need to have meat every meal — let alone sirloin steak.
“I wholeheartedly want pets to be fed a good quality, nutritionally appropriate diet for them,” Frimberger said. “But for most healthy pets, the trend to feed premium quality ingredient food goes back to our habit of viewing our pets’ needs through the lens of what we would like, rather than what they actually need or like. We should remind ourselves that what is appealing to us doesn’t necessarily equate to actual nutritional quality for the pet.”
Frimberger noted there are some new food developments on the market that are worth looking into, especially for dogs, including lab-grown meat. A 2014 study found insects are a good and nutritious source of protein for pets — and not likely to gross your companion out (unlike humans who would find eating such critters revolting).
“Insect-based pet foods can be nutritionally complete and are starting to come onto the market around the world,” Frimberger said. “They can also be a solution for some pets that have food allergies to traditional protein sources.”
And of course, only feed the amount of food that your pet needs — they’ll be healthier and feel better too if they’re not overweight.
Cut out waste
While items like toys, bowls, litter, poop bags and leashes are often necessary for your pet, looking at their durability, supply chains and whether they can be recycled is equally as important as the product itself.
For cats, seek the most environmentally friendly litter option that your feline will accept, such as ones made from organic materials, rather than clay. Although clays are naturally occurring soil minerals, they must be mined, which contributes to soil erosion, habitat destruction and groundwater contamination.
For dogs, choose biodegradable poop bags and always pick it up, no matter where you are. Research shows that not scooping pup poop could cause harmful micro-organisms such as roundworm, E. coli and giardia to survive in your yard for up to four years, which is a health risk for humans.
Okin recommends flushing pet poop straight down the toilet.
“Our water system is designed to handle toxic waste and to keep those pollutants out of the environment,” Okin said. Just be sure you’re not flushing other things down there, too — like pet poop bags or non-flushable kitty litter. Feces only.
And while it may be tempting to dress up your little ones for outings and various holidays, it’s important to buy items with the pet’s genuine welfare in mind. In other words, ask yourself: What does your pet really need, and what are you buying just to satisfy the urge to shop?
“We need to think about the real needs of the pet rather than our drive for consumerism,” Frimberger said.
Adopt responsibly
The general rule is that larger pets will have a larger climate impact than smaller ones, primarily because they need more food. So you might consider smaller breeds or species if you’re aiming to minimize your impact on the planet. A Chihuahua’s carbon pawprint will be much smaller than a Saint Bernard, for example.
You might also consider how some animal breeds tend to come with more health issues.
“Avoiding animals with known health problems will reduce the need for veterinary intervention, which has a carbon footprint, and most importantly will reduce unnecessary suffering in terms of poor health and welfare,” Gudrun Ravetz with Vet Sustain said.
And for those not into all the fluff, cuddling and slobber — you’re in luck.
“Small rodents and birds are great options,” Okin said. “Snakes, turtles and reptiles can have a really low impact, too, for those that are into it.”"

Marco Springmann is from Germany’s Ruhr region, a largely working-class area he likens to the American Rust Belt. His father made a living building generators for coal-fired power plants.
“It’s a very practical, proletarian area that I’m from, and I guess, the diet that I grew up in was very much from the region,” the University of Oxford researcher said. “Lots of sausages.”
Germany happens to be one of the world’s top consumers of sausages and produces more than 1.5 metric tons of it each year.
But Springmann’s tastes started to change when he moved to the US for graduate school… or rather, his thinking started to change.
Springmann was studying to become a physicist when he began learning about the health concerns associated with meat. So, he began removing it from his diet. As he continued studying, he shifted to a completely plant-based diet. He also switched his area of research from physics to atmospheric science and climate change. At the crossroads of his two major interests – health and climate — Springmann’s research was showing how his plant-based diet lowered his carbon footprint.
“My initial thought was, ‘If I know it’s healthier and it’s more environmentally sustainable (to not eat animal products), why wouldn’t I do that?’”
With his meat-eating days over, he dug deeper into the correlation of diet and environment – specifically, how eating less animal-based products could help slow the climate crisis. It’s a topic he said did not get a lot of attention 15 to 20 years ago.
“At that time, most of the climate change research was really sort of on the production side – power plants and how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The link between climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and the food system was really in the baby stage.”
Appetite for destruction
Springmann is now a Senior Researcher in Environment and Health at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute. Based now in the UK, his research has been shared around the world about the “very little chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate change” without a shift in eating habits toward more plant-based diets.
According to Springmann, if everyone adopted a plant-based diet by 2050 it would save about “eight gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.”
“The savings of 8 [gigatons] would be the second biggest emitter. That’s after China’s emissions, but a quarter more than the US’s and double those of Europe.”
One reason for this is that “beef is more than 100-times as emissions-intensive as legumes,” according to Springmann in a 2019 CNN article.
Beside less greenhouse gas emissions, lower meat production would save energy, water and land use around the world. And eating less meat lowers risks of heart disease, obesity and other health problems.
But Springmann is not out to “steak shame” people, insisting he would never tell anyone to become vegan. “I include a plant-based scenario often in my research, but only amongst a plethora of other scenarios like flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian scenarios and so on.”
So there’s no need to get your stomach in a knot worrying about making big sweeping changes to your diet; you don’t need to give up meat completely.
“Our main scenario was this flexitarian scenario,” Springmann says. “That included red meat not more than one serving a week, poultry not more than two servings a week, fish not more than two servings per week and dairy not more than one serving a day. So, if you count it all up, that diet is like vegetarian or vegan up to two days a week.”
Food for thought
Springmann’s own parents, still living in Germany, have gradually started cooking more plant-based meals, opening up their plates to new foods and experimenting in the kitchen.
“For Christmas last year, I tried to make a vegan Beef Wellington which was good fun,” he said. “Everybody liked it, which was nice.”
He’s also beginning to notice an overall change in attitude and diets throughout his homeland.
According to a 2020 report from the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, 55% of those surveyed consider themselves flexitarian. He believes these dietary shifts are happening because many Germans are concerned about the climate crisis and are open to discussing what effects their own behaviors have on it.
“The discussion has really moved a lot and it has helped to talk about the scientific underpinnings of diets and climate change. Whereas in the States, it has become much more polarized.”
Many Americans might have a hard time putting down their hamburgers for the climate crisis, but at the rate the world’s population is growing, meat production won’t be able to keep up. A 2019 World Resources Institute report found that “Americans will need to cut their average consumption of beef by about 40%” in order to keep with the food supply. But the good news is that it is now easier than ever to find meat alternatives and plant-based food almost anywhere you go.
Springmann hopes that the growing concerns around the climate crisis could one day unite us all in a global food movement because everyone will need to have a seat at the table in order to make a change.
“The many challenges we are facing, and will continue to face, can only be addressed if we manage to work together across divides, and I’m hopeful that we can do this.”"
‘Significant intensification’ predicted for Caribbean storm as it tracks toward Gulf of Mexico and Florida,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/23/weather/gulf-mexico-tropical-depression-storm-hermine/index.html,"‘Significant intensification’ predicted for Caribbean storm as it tracks toward Gulf of Mexico and Florida
Editor’s Note: Affected by the storm? Use CNN’s lite site for low bandwidth.
A potent tropical system is churning in the Caribbean on Friday, poised to strengthen significantly as it tracks north toward the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasts show the system intensifying into a Category 3 as it approaches Florida next week, where it could become the first major hurricane for the state since 2018.
The system, Tropical Depression Nine, formed early Friday morning over the central Caribbean Sea and is likely to become the season’s next named storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. It would be named Ian when it strengthens to tropical storm status, which it could do as early as Friday night.
Nine had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph and was around 400 miles southeast of Jamaica on Friday afternoon as it tracked west-northwest at 15 mph.
While the system is expected to undergo slow strengthening over the next couple of days, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warned rapid intensification is possible – if not likely – as it passes over the very warm waters of the Caribbean and the southeast Gulf of Mexico.
If it strengthens to a Category 3 or higher before reaching Florida, it would be the first major hurricane to make landfall there since Hurricane Michael in 2018, which was a monster Category 5 storm when it collided with the Florida panhandle. Michael also underwent rapid intensification before it made landfall, a phenomenon which has been made more likely as ocean temperatures warm due to the climate crisis.
Tropical storm-force winds could begin to affect southwest Florida early Tuesday, with landfall possible on Wednesday. The exact timing and location of the storm’s US landfall will depend highly on its final path, which could shift in the coming days.
The National Hurricane Center said Friday evening there was still “increased track uncertainty” in the forecast after it enters the Gulf of Mexico, noting weather models had shifted west in recent runs. The latest track forecast suggests much of the Gulf Coast of Florida – including the eastern panhandle – could be at risk.
As the forecasts intensify, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday requested federal emergency assistance in anticipation of the threat and also declared a state of emergency for 24 counties. Under the state-level emergency order, members of the Florida National Guard will be activated and on standby awaiting orders.
The governor urged those in the potential path of the storm to prepare.
“This storm has the potential to strengthen into a major hurricane and we encourage all Floridians to make their preparations,” DeSantis said in a news release. “We are coordinating with all state and local government partners to track potential impacts of this storm.”
In the near term, Nine is forecast to bring heavy rain to Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, northern Venezuela and northern Colombia which could lead to flash flooding and mudslides across the islands. The system is then forecast to gain strength, intensifying into a tropical storm as it tracks toward Jamaica and the Cayman islands.
A hurricane watch has been issued for the Cayman Islands, including Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac. A tropical storm watch has been issued for Jamaica.
Forecast rainfall totals:
It has been a slow start to what was forecast to be an above-average hurricane season. Only one storm has made landfall in a US territory, and no hurricane has made landfall or threatened the contiguous United States.
Now, a week past the peak of hurricane season, the tropics seem to have woken up, and forecasters are concerned people have let down their guard.
“After a slow start, the Atlantic hurricane season has ratcheted up quickly,” Phil Klotzbach, research scientist at Colorado State University, tweeted.
“People tend to lower their guard and think, oh, yeah, we’re out of the woods,” Torres said. “But in reality, the season continues. We are still in September; we still have October to go. Anything that forms over either the Atlantic or the Caribbean is something that we need to keep monitoring very closely.”
The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30.
No matter what, if you live in the Caribbean, Florida and other states along the Gulf Coast, pay attention to the updated forecasts this weekend into early next week.

Senate approves treaty to combat climate crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/kigali-amendment-senate-vote/index.html,"Senate approves treaty to combat climate crisis
The Senate ratified an international climate treaty to phase out hydrofluorocarbons – potent greenhouse gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration.
The vote was 69-27, with more than half of Republican senators objecting.
In 2016, the United Nations struck an agreement known as the Kigali Amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Senators who support ratifying the Kigali Amendment said its adoption would position US industries to lead the world in the creation of new, environmentally sound ways of cooling.
“This measure will go a long way to lowering global temperatures, while also creating tens of thousands of American jobs, and deal with the fact that China rarely participates in global cooperation when it comes to putting their own economy and jobs ahead of ours,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
The Kigali amendment is supported by business groups like the Chamber of Commerce and environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council. Advocates for its ratification said it would prevent global warming by up to half a degree Celsius, while benefiting manufacturers developing alternative products.
“Today’s Senate vote was a decade in the making and a profound victory ​for the climate and the American economy,” said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.
In 2020, Congress passed a bill that directed the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly reduce HFCs in line with the goals of the Kigali Amendment. Last year, the Biden administration announced it would move to reduce the use of HFCs by 85% in the next 15 years. And in May, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Senate floor without opposition.
But since then, some Republicans have since grown wary that China agreed to the treaty on more advantageous terms since it is considered a developing country. The Senate passed an amendment from GOP senators Mike Lee of Utah and Dan Sullivan of Alaska designed to alleviate some of the Republican concerns that the agreement would treat China differently than other developed nations.
Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that the treaty gives “China an advantage that they don’t deserve.”
“We need to stand up and start addressing China in these multilateral forums,” Hagerty said.

How sunlight could turn seawater into freshwater for coastal communities,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/middleeast/desalination-manhat-abu-dhabi-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"How sunlight could turn seawater into freshwater for coastal communities
A summer of extreme heat and drought around the world has been a reminder that water scarcity is a pressing issue and one that will only get worse with climate change. Already, more than two billion people worldwide lack easy access to clean water, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
For some countries, desalination plants offer a solution – removing salt from seawater to satisfy their freshwater needs. The Middle East has the highest concentration of these in the world. But such plants, still mostly powered by fossil fuels, are energy-intensive and the process creates an extremely salty wastewater known as brine, which can damage marine ecosystems and animals when it’s pumped back into the sea.
That’s why some startups and researchers are updating centuries-old solar still technology, which uses only sunlight to purify water. While the technology is still a long way off from producing the volume of freshwater generated by desalination plants, it could prove valuable for off-grid or coastal communities.
Floating solar stills
Abu Dhabi-based startup Manhat, founded in 2019, is developing a floating device that distills water without requiring electricity or creating brine. It consists of a greenhouse structure that floats on the surface of the ocean: sunlight heats and evaporates water underneath the structure – separating it from the salt crystals which, are left behind in the sea – and as temperatures cool, the water condenses into freshwater and is collected inside.
“It’s really similar to the natural water cycle,” says Dr. Saeed Alhassan Alkhazraji, the company’s founder and associate professor at Abu Dhabi’s Khalifa University. He says solar evaporation has long been used for this purpose, but typically it involves putting water in a basin where, once the water has evaporated, salt is left behind.
Unlike traditional solar stills, Manhat’s device floats in the ocean, drawing water directly from the sea. Salt does not accumulate in the device and the angle of the collection cylinder prevents water droplets evaporating back to the sea, says Alhassan.
Earlier this year, Manhat’s patented technology won the Water Europe Innovation award for small and medium enterprises with breakthrough solutions in the water sector, commended for its ability to produce freshwater with “zero carbon footprint and zero brine rejection.”
The startup plans to harness its technology in floating farms, which would use its desalination devices to provide freshwater irrigation for crops without the need for water transportation and its associated emissions.
This would benefit arid coastal areas where land is intensively farmed, says Alhassan. “If you produce (fresh) water on the sea’s surface and use it for farming, you can effectively allow arable land to be rejuvenated,” he says, adding that the technology could work well for countries like the Maldives that have little land available for desalination plants.
Others have also been innovating with solar stills. In 2020, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a free-floating desalination unit consisting of a multilayer evaporator that recycles the heat generated when the water vapor condenses, boosting its overall efficiency.
While field tests are ongoing, it was touted as a technology that could “potentially serve off-grid arid coastal areas to provide an efficient, low-cost water source.” Researchers suggested it could be configured as a floating panel on the sea, delivering freshwater through pipes to the shore, or it could be designed to serve a single household, using it atop a tank of seawater.
Scaling up
Geoff Townsend, who works on innovations in water scarcity for water treatment and hygiene company Ecolab, believes that while solar still innovations are unlikely to replace conventional desalination, they could “supplement existing technology, reducing the overall carbon footprint of desalination.”
But he cautions that “desalination typically needs to provide a very predictable supply of water,” and that “there will be potential concerns on the extent to which diurnal (daily) and seasonal changes in performance could impact the ability to achieve the minimal production requirement.”
An even bigger challenge for this kind of technology is scale. “A drawback is their intrinsic low efficiency,” says Townsend, adding that they tend to take up a lot of space for the small amount of water they produce.
MIT’s device was found to produce around five liters of freshwater per hour for every square meter of solar collecting area. Manhat’s current floating prototype, which covers 2.25 square meters but only has one square meter open to water, produces 1.5 liters of freshwater per day – a drop in the ocean, considering the World Health Organization estimates that an average person needs at least 50 to 100 liters a day to be healthy
Alhassan says Manhat is working to increase this volume to five liters by optimizing materials and design, with the long-term goal of reaching at least 20 liters. The startup has raised $130,000 in funding so far, predominantly via a collaboration with Abu Dhabi Ports, but with increased investment he is confident these targets can be met.
A pilot of the floating farm concept will begin next year. By linking up multiple modular devices in a grid formation, Manhat believes that its current technology could provide enough desalination to grow less water-intensive crops, such as mushrooms, and as the devices improve they could start targeting other crops such as lettuce or tomatoes.
Despite the challenges, Alhassan believes solar stills will one day become an important source of freshwater.  “We have to accept the fact that seawater should be a key player in providing freshwater,” he says. “But we need to have a solution that will minimize CO2 emissions and eliminate brine altogether.”"

Siegel is the author of “Let There Be Water: Israel’s Solution for a Water-Starved World” and  “Troubled Water: What’s Wrong with What We Drink.” He is currently the Chief Sustainability Officer of N-Drip, a company which developed water-saving technology for agricultural use.

Scorching temperatures and reports of water scarcity are grabbing headlines, as drought caused by climate change creates long-term problems for farmers and communities in the United States and around the world. Without adequate supply of water, farmers are being forced to plant less in order to conserve the water they will need to get through yet another year of prolonged drought. The consequences will be higher food prices here, but also social instability in countries important to the US.
As frightening and as insurmountable a challenge as chronic and growing water shortages may seem, there are solutions at hand that can save us from crisis.
A small country in one of the driest regions in the world is among those that have developed policies and techniques to provide water in cities and farms alike. That country is Israel. And with drought becoming the new normal, policymakers would be wise to take a look at what Israel has done, and to begin the process of creating their own water-resilient societies that are less dependent on rainfall that may never return.
Although Israel gets nearly all of its tap water from desalination plants along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and a large part of its water for agriculture by purifying and re-using the nation’s sewage, Israel refuses to rely on any single strategy or technology in addressing its water needs.
This “all of the above” approach leads to resilience from this intentional redundancy, but it also opens the door to innovation and risk taking that has often resulted in world-changing breakthroughs.
Israel became a nation in May 1948, but decades before, while under the control of the British Mandate, the Zionist leadership began prioritizing excellence in water, along with defense and immigration policy. In most countries, the (unromantic) subjects of water infrastructure and technology are in the hands of mid-level officials and more junior cabinet members. But to read the diaries of Israel’s founders is to see the daily interest, bordering on obsession, on getting water policy right. For example, long before desalination took off in Israel, the country’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, often wrote about the prospect of “desalting the sea” in order to “make the desert bloom.”
Not everything Israel does is relevant everywhere. Because of its small size, approximately the land area of New Jersey, it can do things more easily than can water-poor countries of vast dimensions. Likewise, having a long coastline and most of its population within relatively easy reach of the country’s desalination facilities, provide opportunities that aren’t available everywhere.
But some of what Israel does, everyone can do – at least, in theory.
First, Israel charges the real price for water. (Though the cost is subsidized for those receiving social welfare; everyone else pays the full price.) By use of market forces, consumers, farmers and industry are always looking for ways to conserve water, or to use technology that leads to the most efficient use of water possible. In most of the world, water is deeply subsidized which leads to enormous wasting of water due to overuse. As one example, because at full market price it is cheaper to fix leaky pipes than to waste the water, Israel has an uncommonly low leak factor of about 7-8%. Even in the US, there are communities with water mains that lose up to 50% of the water flowing through them.
Israel’s success in water is also tied to the decision to put the administration of the country’s water is in the hands of apolitical technocrats. Their job is to get the highest quality water to the largest number of people possible. Price is a factor, but not the only one. By comparison, in some US cities, mayors know that their constituents may see a rise in water rates as a de facto tax increase. This results in suppressed water fees, and with it the inability to modernize facilities with the best equipment and software, and difficulty in attracting and retaining highly skilled engineers.
Israel also differs from much of the world in its approach to agriculture. Decades ago, flood irrigation – which soaks soil by flooding fields with water – was discouraged by the government, effectively ending the practice. Yet, around the world, 85 percent of irrigated fields use flood irrigation, a practice that goes back to the time of ancient Egypt and the flooding of the Nile River Basin.
While this wasteful and unsustainable method may be thought to be in use only in less developed countries, here in the US, we flood irrigate millions of acres in California, Texas, and even in the parched southwest. Farmers have little incentive to switch to water-saving technology because they can continue using water as if it were as abundant and inexhaustible as sunshine or air. In Arizona, for example, 89% of the irrigation used is flood irrigation, and in the states of the rapidly depleting Colorado River Basin, there are as many as six million acres that continue wasting trillions of gallons annually by flooding fields.
Fittingly, Israeli technology may come to the rescue in the US southwest. Low-cost, gravity-fed drip irrigation, developed by an Israeli scientist, has already been deployed on thousands of acres in Arizona and elsewhere. (Full disclosure: I work with this scientist’s company.) The technology saves half of the water previously needed for flood-irrigated fields while improving yields and reducing the need for water-polluting fertilizer. This newer approach is similar to the more familiar form of drip irrigation invented in Israel more than 60 years ago. But this system uses gravity as its energy source, eliminating ongoing external energy use and expense.

It’s been said that the wars of the 21st century will be fought over water. That may be so, but it is cheaper and smarter for every water-stressed region and country to transform how it uses its water. That has to start with changing how we think about our water. And in that, every country – rich or poor, large or small, landlocked or with a long seacoast – can learn from what Israel has done."
Experts slam ‘pittance’ in aid to Pakistan as they find climate crisis played a role in floods,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/asia/pakistan-climate-floods-attribution-intl/index.html,"Experts slam ‘pittance’ in aid to Pakistan as they find climate crisis played a role in floods
An analysis of Pakistan’s devastating floods has found “fingerprints” of the human-made climate crisis on the disaster, which killed more than 1,500 people and destroyed so much land and infrastructure it has plunged the South Asian nation into crisis.
The analysis, published Thursday by the World Weather Attribution initiative, was unable to quantify exactly how much climate change contributed to the floods — which were caused by several months of heavy rainfall in the region — but some of its models found that the crisis may have increased the intensity of rainfall by up to 50%, when looking specifically at a five-day downpour that hit the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan hard.
The analysis also found that the floods were likely a 1-in-100-year event, meaning that there is a 1% chance of similarly heavy rainfall each year.
If the world warms by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures — as it is on course to — short rain bursts like those seen in the five-day period will likely become even more intense. The Earth is already around 1.2 degrees warmer than it was before industrialization.
The scale of the floods and the WWA analysis highlight the enormous financial need to address impacts of the climate crisis.
“The kind of assistance that’s coming in right now is a pittance,” Ayesha Siddiqi, a geographer at the University of Cambridge, told journalists at a press conference. “A number of Western economies have argued that they’re suffering their own crises, because of the war in Ukraine and various other issues.”
She described the UK’s original assistance of £1.5 million ($1.7 million) as “laughable.”
The UK has, however, increased its pledge to £15 million ($17 million) more recently. The geographical area that is now Pakistan was part of the former British colony of India until 1947, when the British partitioned the land into two separate dominions.
Fully developed nations bear a far larger historical contribution to climate change than the developing world.
Siddiqi said that the funds coming into Pakistan paled in comparison with the assistance sent after deadly floods that hit the country in 2010.
“The big global news [in 2010] was all about ‘We must help Pakistan or the Islamists will win,’” she said, explaining that there was a fear in the West at the time that Islamist groups would take advantage of the floods’ aftermath to recruit more members. “And this time around, of course, we don’t have the same geopolitical imperative to help Pakistan, and so the aid has really been a pittance.”
Pakistan is responsible for around 0.6% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, even though it makes up nearly 2.7% of the global population, according to the European Union’s global emissions database. China is the world’s biggest emitter, at 32.5%, and while the US is second, accounting for 12.6%, it is historically the biggest emitter globally.
More than 33 million people in Pakistan have been impacted by the floods, which is more than the population of Australia or the state of Texas. The floods destroyed 1.7 million homes, swept away dozens of bridges and turned verdant farmland into fields of dust.
The UN estimates the recovery could cost around $30 billion, which around the same value as the country’s annual exports.
What’s to come
There were limitations to how much scientists could determine about the role of the climate crisis in the floods because the impacted area has such huge natural variability in rain patterns during monsoon seasons. It’s also a year of La Niña, which typically brings heavier and longer rainfall to Pakistan.
The role of climate change in heat waves — which also hit Pakistan and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere this year — is much larger and often clearer to determine in South Asia, the scientists said. A WWA study published in May found that pre-monsoonal heat waves in Pakistan and India were made 30 times more likely by climate change.
“Every year the chance of a record-breaking heat wave is higher than the year before,” said Friederike Otto, co-founder of WWA and a climate scientist with the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.
The next heat wave in Pakistan will probably have “quite devastating consequences,” she said. “Because even if everything is done now to invest in reducing vulnerability, that takes time.”
She said that while scientists couldn’t determine exactly how much climate change contributed to the floods, it was probably closer to “doubling” their likelihood, as opposed to the 30-fold factor they found with the region’s heat wave.
The issue of who should pay for the impacts of the climate crisis, known as “loss and damage,” has long been a sticking point between developing and some developed nations, and is expected to be central to the upcoming COP27 international climate talks in Egypt.
“I think it’s absolutely justified to say, ‘We need, finally, some real commitment to addressing loss and damage from climate change,” Otto said.
“A lot of what leads to disaster is related to existing vulnerabilities and not to human-caused climate change. But of course, the Global North plays a very large role in that as well, because a lot of these vulnerabilities are from colonialism and so on. So there is a … very huge responsibility for the Global North to finally do something real and not just talk.”"
UN chief says ‘fossil fuel free-for-all’ must end as report warns world heading in ‘wrong direction’,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/world/climate-wmo-report-un-intl/index.html,"UN chief says ‘fossil fuel free-for-all’ must end as report warns world heading in ‘wrong direction’
The impacts of climate change are “heading into uncharted territories of destruction,” UN Secretary General António Guterres warned on Tuesday on the release of a multi-agency scientific report reviewing the latest research on the subject.
The report, led by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), warns that the world is “going in the wrong direction” on climate change.
With greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise in the atmosphere and world leaders failing to adopt strategies to hold global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the Earth is inching closer to dangerous climate tipping points, the United in Science report says.
Already, extreme weather events are more frequent and more intense.
“Heatwaves in Europe. Colossal floods in Pakistan …There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters,” Guterres said in a video message.
“The current fossil fuel free-for-all must end now. It is a recipe for permanent climate chaos and suffering,” he added.
Despite a dip in emissions during coronavirus lockdowns, planet-warming emissions have since soared beyond pre-pandemic levels. Preliminary data reveal that global carbon dioxide emissions in the first half of this year were 1.2% higher than during the same period in 2019, the report finds.
The past seven years were the warmest on record.
The global average temperature has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. And scientists expect the annual average could be anywhere between 1.1C and 1.7C warmer up to 2026 — meaning there’s a chance we could pass the 1.5C warming threshold in the next five years.
The report also said that the world was way off track in containing warming to 1.5C. Ambitions for emissions cuts by 2030 need to rise seven-fold to keep the goal in reach.
By the end of the century, without aggressive climate action, global warming is estimated to reach 2.8C. But even at the current level of warming we could pass several climate tipping points.
The ocean current that moves heat from the tropics into the northern hemisphere, for example, is now at its slowest in 1,000 years — jeopardizing historic weather patterns, says the report, which includes contributions from the UN Environment Programme and UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.
Nearly half the world’s population is considered highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change – floods, heat, drought, wildfires and storms.
By the 2050s, over 1.6 billion city-dwellers will regularly swelter through three-month average temperatures of at least 35C (95F).
To help communities cope, the WMO has promised to put every person on Earth under the protection of an early warning system within the next five years.

Biden’s Delaware vacation home faces ‘extreme’ flood risk as climate change leads to rising seas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/politics/climate-change-biden-vacation-house-invs/index.html,"Biden’s Delaware vacation home faces ‘extreme’ flood risk as climate change leads to rising seas
As he’s traveled the country to visit victims of storms, wildfires, and floods, President Joe Biden has returned to a similar theme: Climate change is “everybody’s crisis,” as he declared last year after surveying flooded-out New York homes in the wake of Hurricane Ida.
Biden doesn’t say it explicitly, but that “everybody” includes himself. The President’s vacation home near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, is in the middle of a flood zone, and an analysis by a climate research group shows that the house is facing “extreme” flooding risk that is expected to get more severe over time.
That means the nation’s homeowner-in-chief is among the millions of Americans who are facing climate-linked danger to their properties – and he has a big personal financial stake in the fight against the climate crisis.
Biden’s multi-million-dollar vacation home, which he has visited nearly a dozen times during his presidency, is in a quiet community tucked between a canal, the wetlands of a state park, and the Atlantic Ocean. Delaware has the lowest average elevation of any state, leaving neighborhoods like his in danger of being swamped during storms.
Biden and his wife Jill bought the home in 2017 after he left the vice presidency, and the structure is elevated to avoid major damage from all but the most catastrophic floods.
Elevation can be a powerful tool to protect against flood damage. Some climate advocates, while applauding Biden’s legislative accomplishments, argue that his administration should do more to help other residents of flood zones raise their homes – in a similar manner to the President’s summer retreat.
And they note that areas like Biden’s wealthy neighborhood, where streets are dotted with elevated homes, are far better protected from the impacts of climate change than poorer communities hit by disastrous flooding, from rural Kentucky to Jackson, Mississippi.
“When rain falls, it falls on those in power and those without power as well,” said Daniel Gilford, a researcher at the nonprofit Climate Central. “Climate change comes for all of us, but only some are wealthy enough to protect themselves.”
Rising waters, rising risks
Biden’s home is in North Shores, an unincorporated community about a mile north of Rehoboth Beach’s tourist-filled boardwalk. The area was first developed in the 1950s and 60s on marshland that was filled in, government records and historic aerial photos show.
Early newspaper articles promoted the development’s “rustic simplicity” and “maximum privacy.” But the low-lying area also faced flooding and damage during multiple storms over the years, at times leaving streets inundated with up to six feet of water.
Biden’s six-bed, five-and-a-half-bath house was built near the development’s north end in 2007, according to real estate listings. In June 2017, soon after signing a multi-million-dollar book deal, the Bidens bought the home for $2.74 million, property records show. Thanks to a pandemic-era jump in home prices, it’s now worth nearly $3.8 million, according to an estimate from the real estate website Redfin.
The home overlooks the salt marshes of Cape Henlopen State Park – a former military site that Biden helped return to Delaware when he was a US senator, and where he’s often spotted biking on weekends. The Rehoboth-Lewes Canal borders one side of the neighborhood, and North Shores’ private beach is about a half-mile walk away.
The proximity to water from multiple directions comes with a downside. The home has an extreme risk of flooding – 10 on a scale of 10 – according to the climate research group First Street Foundation, which has used environmental science and computer modeling to estimate flood risk for every property in the US.
There’s a 98% chance of flood water reaching Biden’s house within the next five years, First Street found. Less than 5% of properties nationwide have as high a flood risk.
The home is in FEMA’s Special Flood Hazard Area – the zone that would be inundated during a 100-year flood. A rarer 500-year flood would be likely to inundate the property with just over 10 feet of water, according to First Street’s national model. As climate change advances, the same flood would be expected to reach a depth of 11.4 feet in 30 years.
And as Biden himself has noted, “what used to be once-in-a-century storms are now happening every few years.”
Defended by building up
In an apparent response to that risk, Biden’s home was designed with flooding in mind. The living area is elevated about 10 feet off the ground, according to county records, with a broad exterior staircase leading to the double front doors and the ground floor used as a garage.
Many of the first couple’s neighbors live at similar heights, with some huge homes suspended on stilts. New and significantly renovated homes are required by the county to be raised to a height known as the base flood elevation – five feet for much of the neighborhood.
Steven Hollman, who owns a home around the block from Biden’s and serves as the president of the North Shores Board of Governors, said the community has taken efforts to mitigate the risk from floods. That includes maintaining and replenishing their private beach’s sand dunes “at not insignificant expense,” he said.
The dunes are “our first safeguard,” Hollman said. “If we have a breach of the dunes because of a cataclysmic weather event, then that’s going to affect the entire community.”
Still, as climate change advances and sea levels rise, flooding that seeps up from the low-elevation marsh that borders Biden’s property will likely become more common, according to University of Delaware professor John Callahan, who studies flood risk in the state. Eventually, it could mean high-tide flooding, with water regularly reaching streets even on days without major storms.
“A lot of flooding in neighborhoods like this is not from the ocean but from behind – the streams, marshes, and canals that all fill up and flood,” Callahan said.
The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment about the home’s flood risk, or whether the Bidens have flood insurance. While the first couple aren’t required to have flood insurance because they don’t have a mortgage on the home, Hollman said flood insurance in North Shores is “very common” even for homeowners without mortgages.
Biden’s neighborhood is an example of how development near the coast can lead to more people facing flood danger decades later – a trend that’s still happening today. The surrounding Sussex County has seen a boom in housing construction, and had more homes built in areas at high risk of flooding than almost any other coastal county in the US, according to a 2019 report from Climate Central.
That kind of development is “gambling on people’s future resilience,” said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist with the environmental organization Delaware Sea Grant. “It’s passing the risk on to homebuyers and future generations.”
From Rehoboth to Mar-a-Lago
Owning a home at risk from climate change doesn’t necessarily make a president more likely to address the crisis. But Biden has advanced measures to help protect flood-prone areas – although experts say his administration could go further.
Chad Berginnis, the executive director of The Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the administration’s accomplishments included allocating more funding to build flood mitigation infrastructure projects, update rainfall frequency information, and expand flood maps. He called the progress on those issues “very encouraging.”

Your home may be in a flood zone, even if it's not on a FEMA flood map. Here's why
Still, Berginnis said more should be done to help individual homeowners in flood zones raise or relocate their homes – key adaptation measures that have successfully protected communities.
“Going property by property is a slower slog, but it’s an effective solution, especially for many smaller communities that can’t afford or maintain” larger projects like seawalls, Berginnis said.
While the infrastructure bill Biden signed last year increases funding for home elevations and other flood mitigation projects, experts say it doesn’t meet the growing need.
And the bulk of grant funding for home elevations has gone to wealthy and White neighborhoods, in part because federal programs take into account the higher property values in those areas, an investigation by Politico earlier this year found. FEMA has said it is working to address the disparity and help disadvantaged communities. (No homes in Biden’s Rehoboth Beach-area zip code have received federal elevation grants, according to FEMA data.)

“Elevating homes can be pricey, and it’s easier to make the money work when properties have higher value,” said Kristin Smith, a researcher with the nonprofit Headwaters Economics. That can end up excluding “some of the people who need help the most,” especially in low-income areas, she said.
Research has found that poor and minority neighborhoods have been disproportionately affected by some climate change-linked flooding, and are likely to see the greatest increases in risk over time. Less privileged communities are also more likely to struggle to recover from flooding – especially compared to places like North Shores, where most houses are vacation homes, not primary residences.
More broadly, Biden’s recent climate legislation is the farthest-reaching bill of its kind in US history, and includes hundreds of billions of dollars to reduce the carbon emissions that lead to sea level rise. However, the spending package didn’t fund programs like subsidized flood insurance that had been included in previous versions of the proposal.
Biden isn’t the only executive branch leader who has a home facing climate danger: Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken publicly about how her house in Los Angeles has been threatened by wildfire.
And former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has a similar level of flood risk as Biden’s vacation home, according to First Street.
Trump spurned the scientific consensus on climate change, and unraveled or weakened dozens of environmental regulations during his time in the White House. Notably, Trump axed an Obama-era executive order that toughened building standards for federally funded construction projects in flood zones – and Biden brought it back.
That contrast between two presidents who both like to vacation in areas threatened by rising seas shows the wide variations in how Americans respond to climate risk, Berginnis said.
“Presidents are people, and human nature is a funny thing,” he said. “They are going to come to their own approaches and conclusions.”"
Australians are bracing for more pain from rain this summer as third La Niña confirmed,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/australia/australia-la-nina-weather-climate-intl/index.html,"Australians are bracing for more pain from rain this summer as third La Niña confirmed
Much of Australia will face unusually heavy rains in coming months, the country’s weather forecaster said on Tuesday, after confirming that a La Niña weather event is under way for the third year in a row and would likely last into next year.
The Bureau of Meteorology firmed up its guidance for this year for the weather pattern known in Australia to produce wet, windy summers, saying it was now under way after it previously had forecast a high chance.
The event puts the country’s densely populated east coast on alert when many residents are still rebuilding after floods linked to the most recent La Niña, which ran into early 2022.
The weather phenomenon was among factors that would “push Australia’s climate towards a wetter phase and … have shaped our outlook for the coming months that shows more than 80% chance of above average rainfall for many parts of the eastern half of Australia,” the bureau said in a statement.
Wild weather swings in Australia brought its worst bushfires in a generation in late 2019 and early 2020, followed by two La Niña patterns, which swelled rivers beyond their banks and left thousands of flooded homes uninhabitable.
“This is not good news for communities, businesses, homeowners, and renters who are living or operating out of buildings and dwellings that are at risk from inundation,” said Mark Gibbs, an adjunct professor with Queensland University of Technology’s Institute for Future Environments.
“This may be particularly problematic for those that are still recovering from recent floods, especially in light of the present challenges in securing the services of builders and building suppliers,” he added.
With La Niña, sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean are cooler than normal, while waters in the western tropical Pacific are warmer than normal, generating moisture that brings rain to eastern and central Australia.
La Niña and climate change
While La Niña – an the opposite El Niño – events are regular aspects of global weather patterns, increased global temperatures may temper or change their effects. La Niña tends to pull down global temperatures, but in recent years, the planet has warmed so fast, it’s like hitting a small speed bump at 80 mph – it barely even registers.
It’s likely too early to know how climate change will affect those patterns; research is beginning to show how a warming climate may amplify the effects of El Niño and La Niña. Climate change could increase the severity of weather events stemming from El Niño and La Niña patterns, according to a 2018 study on atmospheric conditions that ran simulations of climate conditions.
Top spots on the warmest-years list used to be reserved for the strong El Niño years, but human influences have long since overwhelmed the planet’s natural temperature regulators. For instance, La Niña was present during parts of 2020, but the year still tied with 2016 (an El Niño year) as the hottest on record for the planet."

WOW! Can I get a hallelujah for these temperatures? After what seemed like a summer in the furnace, I think we can all get on board with some fall-like temperatures for a few days.
Unfortunately, it won’t be for everyone. The tiny cool blast will only be for portions of the country. And as much as my heart wants to tell you it’s here to stay, it won’t. Sadly, it’s going to be such a quick shot of amazing air, if we blink, we might miss it.
But I’m going to rejoice in the fact I won’t be wiping upper lip sweat for a few days and believe it’s a sign we are turning the corner and better weather lies ahead for those of us who have been sweating it out with me during the last few months!
The first significant cold front of the season is in progress across the midsection of the country today, and it’s leading the charge in bringing temperatures AND dew points down. The dew point is responsible for the humidity, so when temperatures fall along with the dew points, it’s a wonderful combination.
“Today will be a spectacular fall day with plenty of sunshine, low humidity, and highs in the 70s,” the National Weather Service in Nashville wrote. “Tonight will be on the cool side with lows in the low to mid 50s.”
While the front has made it all the way to portions of the South this morning, there are still some lingering showers and storms across the Midwest.
“The flood threat should be diminishing with time but given how saturated conditions are from the record rainfall yesterday, it won’t take much to result in some renewed flooding concerns,” explained the weather service office in Chicago.
Rockford, Illinois recorded 4.34 inches of rain on Sunday, breaking a daily record for rainfall, prompting concern for flooding today. Any additional downpours falling on already saturated soils will create flash flooding potential.
The showers along the front will ultimately be responsible for the taste of fall.
“Tuesday should be the first in a string of consecutive days of some very pleasant early fall/late summer weather,” the weather service office in Chicago added.
While the cool changes will be short-lived, they will be dramatic.
“High pressure builds on the backside of the cold front moving across the Midwest and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys today, sending high temperatures falling dramatically into the 60s, which will be 15-25 degrees below average,” the Weather Prediction Center noted.
For places like Atlanta, which endured temperatures in the low 90s to start the month, many will welcome cooler temperatures with open arms.
“As the front starts to work its way through north Georgia today, a very fall-like airmass will filter in behind the front,” the weather service Atlanta wrote.
Temperatures will only make it up to the mid- to upper 70s this afternoon, in combination with lower humidity levels. By Tuesday morning, lows will be in the mid-50s to mid-60s for much of the region, something the South has not experienced for quite a while.
If Atlanta’s updated low forecast of 57 verifies, “it would end a 125-day stretch going back to May 10th of minimum temperatures at or above 60 degrees, the 11th longest stretch within the period of record,” the Atlanta weather service office explained.
The cooler air will reach portions of New England by the end of the week, and they are already excited about it.
Check the forecast temperatures in your city
“Well, hello there fall. That’s what you’ll be thinking Thursday morning when you wake up and notice temperatures in the upper 30s to upper 40s across the North Country,” said the weather service office in Burlington, Vermont. “A blast of early season colder air will bring fall-like temperatures to the region Thursday through Saturday.”
It will be a refreshing change for even the northern tier of the country, a region where the taste of fall could get many excited about pumpkin spice and beautiful fall colors. However, the Northeast has been in the midst of a flash drought this summer, and it could have an effect on the fall color.
The drought has improved a little compared to last week, though nearly 20% of the Northeast is still in drought conditions.
As we said in the headline, this is a “false fall,” and it cannot be trusted.
False fall is nothing more than just a tease, with a few days of fall-like temperatures before we return to warmer temperatures in the blink of an eye.
For much of the Midwest, temperatures will already be moderating by midweek. So, for the next few days, enjoy your break from summer.
By the way, the fall equinox is on September 22 (even though meteorological fall began on September 1), and we all know it means nothing when it comes to Mother Nature, so if you are one of the lucky ones experiencing this false fall, ENJOY!
Summer continues for many
We aren’t trying to brag about the cooler temperatures too much because many of you will be baking in the summer sun this week as temperatures soar well above normal, especially for the Rockies and Plains.
“Highs in the 80s over the Northern/Central Rockies/Plains will be anywhere between 10-20 degrees above average today, then highs in the 80s to low 90s in the Northern/Central Plains will be 10-15 degrees above average on Tuesday,” the Weather Prediction Center outlined.
Places like Dodge City and Lincoln will be in the 90s to start the first half of the week. Even Bismark will be flirting with 90 this afternoon.
But just like the false fall for the midsection of the country, the heat in will be mostly short-lived as temperatures fall to more seasonal norms by midweek.
Next week doesn’t look much better. The Climate Prediction Center is forecasting above-average temperatures for much of the country."
How the Northeast’s extreme drought could spoil this year’s fall colors,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/us/fall-colors-northeast-drought-climate/index.html,"How the Northeast’s extreme drought could spoil this year’s fall colors
Three years ago, Andy Finton planted a sugar maple tree – his favorite species – in his suburban Boston backyard. Each fall he waits for its leaves to change into the bright red or deep orange autumn colors the tree is known for.
That’s probably not going to happen this year.
Severe drought has been spreading and intensifying in New England this summer, prompting concerns over how vibrant the region’s fall colors show will be and whether the muted outlook could impact its multi-billion dollar fall tourism industry.
“We’re seeing stressed trees that haven’t had enough precipitation and are losing their leaves earlier,” Finton, the landscape conservation director and forest ecologist for the Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts, told CNN. “So leaves are withering, they’re drying up, and doing that fall color change before those crisp fall nights.”
All of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut are entirely in drought, according to the US Drought Monitor, despite recent rainfall. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, much of New England saw record warm temperatures in August. Together, the drought and summertime extreme temperatures have made it seem to the trees as if fall came early, said Richard B. Primack, professor of biology and plant ecology at Boston University.
“The climate is changing; and because the climate is changing, the plants are responding to that,” Primack told CNN. In a normal year, peak fall foliage usually starts between late September and is most concentrated in early to mid-October.  “But in a year like this one, where there’s drought, the fall foliage is actually starting earlier.”
Fall season in New England brings around eight billion dollars in tourism revenue each year, according to the US Forest Service. People from all over the country, particularly in the Northeast, travel to the region to see the picturesque, vibrant fall foliage. But despite the changes, tour companies have yet to feel the economic impact – though conversations are happening in the industry about how the changing climate is affecting fall colors.
“We’ve discussed this very topic over the summer and recognize that the drought will indeed impact the fall colors,” Michelle Pino, vice president and co-founder of Northeast Unlimited Tours, told CNN, noting that many of the tours this year have already been booked and paid for at least a year in advance.
Primack said the changing climate also affects year-to-year variability. New England already has one of the most variable climates of any temperate region in the world, and warming temperatures are only increasing that variability.
“Every year seems to be a really different year,” he said.
Last year, for instance, was one of the wettest on record in New England. July 2021 in Massachusetts was the wettest such month in the state’s history. In contrast to this year’s drought, heavy rainfall and hot temperatures last summer put stress on the trees, prompting the leaves to change later in the season.
This year’s drought triggered an opposite kind of stress – trees haven’t had sufficient precipitation, so leaves are withering and dying much earlier.
According to Pino, the main concern this year are the tours they booked for later in October.  When they planned the tours back in 2021, they booked them according to foliage prediction. But “over the course of the last decade, the foliage color arrived later and later, so we began shifting our fall tours away from later September and more into October as late as the third week,” she said. “Of course, we could never have predicted this drought.”
Finton said the perfect conditions to get the best fall color – the reds and oranges that draw leaf peepers to the Northeast – require an average amount of rain in the summer and cool fall temperatures, when nights are cold and days are bright, crisp and sunny at around 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Much like humans, trees can detect that winter is coming, and they respond to the shift accordingly.
“The length of the daylight is the primary trigger for leaves to change color in the fall, but then the timing and the quality of fall color is very dependent on weather and the changing climate,” Finton said.
Between late September and into October, Primack explained that plants typically undergo a process called leaf senescence, which is essentially the last development stage where leaves conserve nutrients before they are damaged by frost. It can also be brought on by environmental stress like drought, extreme temperatures or too much precipitation.
If temperatures are warm and the ground stays moist from rainfall – indicators that winter is still a ways off – leaves will change color later in the season. This year is the opposite. Trees are undergoing leaf senescence and color changes earlier than normal because the plants aren’t getting enough water.
The impact of the drought is particularly stark in places that tend to be drier on average, experts say, such as areas along railroad tracks, tree-lined streets and dry rocky ridges.
“If you go out into the woods in the Boston area, you see a lot of just dead leaves on the ground right now that are just brown, so they haven’t undergone color change,” Primack said. “The conditions have been so difficult for the trees and the shrubs that the leaves have just withered on the trees, and they’ve just fallen off.”
Finton said the world needs to work together to slash planet-warming emissions and reduce the stress on the planet’s trees and forests.
And he also said that there’s still hope for fall colors in the Northeast given recent rainfall – including his backyard sugar maple tree.
“I know it’s alive and it’s still relatively healthy; and if this year isn’t its year, then next year hopefully will be,” Finton said. “Our trees and forests are very inherently resilient.”"

Editor’s Note: Christian Vescia is an instructional designer for a San Francisco fintech company and an avid gardener. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
A few months ago, I said goodbye to the lawn in front of our house. In my city of San Carlos, California, a lot of people are modifying their landscaping to reduce water use and a lush carpet of grass – while not quite a thing of the past – is becoming less common. My wife and I wanted to do our part too, but weren’t ready to implement a full-on xeriscape solution with succulents and desert plants.
Like a lot of places, we’re facing the obvious impacts of climate change here in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over the Labor day weekend, a heat wave sent the thermometer up to a scorching 108 degrees, 20 or more degrees Fahrenheit above normal. We’re also in the grip of another multiple-year drought. In fact, 2022 has been the driest year on record in California. Wildfires raging across the state are another reminder of just how severe that drought has become.
So as beautiful as a plush carpet of grass can be, we couldn’t justify using the hundreds of gallons of water required to maintain the three lawns we have on our property: a front lawn, a back lawn and a third lawn on an upper terrace in our backyard.
Our family has always been conscientious in our use of water: it affects how we take showers (short), do the dishes (not letting the water run and cascading rinse water into an adjacent pot to re-use), and wash our produce (transporting water from washing lettuce and vegetables to water plants the garden).
Climate change is causing me and many of our neighbors to look for even more ways to conserve water. The next step for me, as an avid gardener, was to look for ways to save water in the garden – starting with getting rid of most of our grass.
In some parts of California that have been even harder hit by drought than we have, residents are being paid by the square foot to remove their lawns. Even without that kind of rebate, some homeowners in my area are full on taking out the front yard, putting in succulents – not just a low-water, but almost a no-water solution, putting in plants like cactus and agave. I wasn’t convinced, however, that that would go well with the rest of our garden. We have a crabapple tree in the front and other evergreen shrubs and plants that come from the desert would look out of place together with those plants.
We decided to replace our front lawn with a low-water ground cover and remove our smaller back lawn entirely. In the back we installed a crushed gravel patio where we can have meals outside in the garden. We kept a moderate-sized lawn in place at the top of our backyard, where we like to sit in the evening on our own or with guests.
To be honest, removing the front lawn was not only about saving water. I’d also come to feel that maintaining a lawn was a hassle: I was tired of mowing it every other week. And, since I’ve never been a fan of the weed whacker, edging the lawn required getting down on my hands and knees with shears to give it a trim. I was happy to say goodbye to all of that.
My wife Lucia and I researched several different types of no-mow lawns that use different sorts of grasses. However, many of those didn’t work very well with our existing landscaping. We also investigated drought-tolerant ground covers. Eventually, based on the suggestion of some friends – one of whom used to work for a municipal water service – we decided to plant a ground cover that originated in Asia, called kurapia that is drought tolerant and uses significantly less water than a traditional lawn –  as much as 80% less according to some studies.
I’ve read that kurapia roots eventually go down 5-10 feet, so it holds up well in a drought. It grows to about 2 to 3 inches tall, is nice and green and has attractive small white flowers. You can mow it if you’d like to encourage it to grow a little bit more densely, but that might be the kind of thing you do once or twice a year, if at all.
A lot of people don’t like non-native plants, which they fear will become invasive and hard to eradicate where they’re not wanted, but kurapia is sterile and has been germinated not to spread where it’s not planted. We’ve had a lot of people asking about it as they stroll around the neighborhood. Most are looking for alternatives to maintaining a water-thirsty lawn or having a dead patch of ugly brown grass in front of their homes.
Making the switch from grass to this ground cover wasn’t inexpensive. The plants needed for my 1,000 square-foot front yard cost around $900 and my landscaper took a day or more to install them. However, we expect to recoup some of that expense by lowering our water bills as a result of replacing or eliminating most of the lawns. Now that we’ve made the switch, I love the fact that I don’t have to stalk back and forth across the lawn every two weeks behind a noisy mower. Most of all, I feel good about using less of our precious water resources.
It’s important for all of us in the western United States to know where our water comes from. Once you do, you realize how we regularly have to make difficult tradeoffs between the three main uses of our water: agriculture, municipal water use and sustaining a healthy environment. Once you become aware of the limits of our supply, the critical importance of conservation stands out and it motivates you to look for new ways to reduce your water use.
Besides conserving water in the garden, we also do what we can in the house. We have a recirculation pump we turn on with a wireless remote before taking a shower that forces hot water through the pipes to our bathrooms. That way, we don’t have to run gallons of water down the drain while we wait for the water to heat up. We take advantage of our county-level conservation programs too. For example, we made use of a $300 rebate from the county to help replace our old washing machine with a modern, front-loading model that uses much less water. The rebate reduced the cost of the machine by nearly 30%. The new machine even weighs the laundry before the cycle to determine how much water is needed for the size of the load.

Between our nice, green, no-mow ground cover in the front, and our new gravel patio in the back, we’re very happy with our new yards and reduced water use. For the back, we’ve ordered a nice, extendable outdoor table so we can eat outside.
Now that I’ll soon be entering my retirement, one of the things I’m looking forward to is cooking big meals, having friends over and dining al fresco on my back patio of my garden – now almost entirely free of grass."

August will be one to remember for all the worst reasons. From epic flooding in Pakistan and along the Mississippi, to drought in China and out-of-control fires in Europe, the climate crisis is wreaking havoc on planet Earth on a new scale.
Yet, these disasters and their fallout are not evenly distributed. The Global South – low or middle income countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean – is suffering disproportionately, as climate scientists say it will for years to come.
If indeed it is global warming that is causing or even simply aggravating these extreme weather events, as scientists generally concur, then the South’s ever angrier nations are completely justified in their demands that the world’s wealthier regions – those ultimately responsible for this made-in-the-developed-world crisis – pay for its losses. In particular, the historically largest emissions sinners – the United States and Europe.
But these poorer countries shouldn’t count on it because not only is most of the Global North in denial about its oversized role in creating the crisis – it is dead set against condoning the principle of liability.
Pakistan is currently suffering this catastrophe – let’s call it “climate breakdown,” since this is what scientists say is happening – more acutely than anywhere else in the world. More than 1,300 people have lost their lives and 33 million others are affected in what Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week referred to as “the worst [monsoon season] in the country’s history.”
The grim images of washed away houses, stranded refugees, children and elderly people in rushing floodwaters vividly underscore the gross inequities of the crisis that is reverberating across the Global South. Indeed many of the 3.6 billion most vulnerable people shouldering the worst of climate breakdown live in the Global South.
According to the UN World Food Program, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe extreme weather resulting from rising temperatures is forcing millions of already poor people into hunger. The current figure of up to 828 million people going hungry every night around the world will soar if global heating is not checked, it says.
While the human cost is unquantifiable, the economic price tag isn’t. In Pakistan, a third of the country is underwater. The torrential rainfall and flooding, now in its second month, has destroyed one million homes, about 2,200 miles of roads, and submerged  a third of the country – including more than two million acres (809,371 hectares) of farmland, robbing the residents there of their livelihoods. The damage thus far is estimated at more than $10 billion, or 4% of the country’s annual gross domestic product, according to Pakistani officials.
The emissions sinners should pay
If one is convinced that the climate breakdown is man-made, as scientists concur, namely a product of emissions caused by burning fossil fuels, then it’s impossible to argue that countries like Pakistan themselves are responsible for this destruction.
According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan accounts for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases. Horn of Africa nations Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan – enduring a grueling two-year drought and extreme food insecurity – are together responsible for only 0.1% of global emissions.
In 2020, all of Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for a per capita carbon footprint of around just 0.1 tons, in contrast to 17 tons in Australia, 18.5 in Canada and 15.5 in the US. Pakistan’s per capita emissions is under one ton.
Historically, namely since 1850, the US has 25% of all carbon emissions to answer for, the EU countries, including the UK, comes in an ignominious second at 22%. China, though today’s biggest single emitter, is historically a distant third with 13% of total global emissions. One study calculated that the Global North is responsible for 92% of global emissions in excess of the planetary boundary.
Yet it is the Global South that is on the frontlines of climate breakdown. Pakistan ranks eighth in terms of climate-related vulnerability, behind countries including Myanmar, Haiti, Mozambique and Bangladesh, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In 2021, heavy rains left a quarter of Bangladesh under water and wrecked the homes of millions. The Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Tuvalu have next to no carbon footprint but are vanishing beneath rising tides.
Thus it’s understandable that these countries have for years been calling for accountability and compensation. “Loss and damages” is emerging as a third pillar of the UN-led climate negotiations alongside mitigation and adaption. The issue was a flashpoint at the last UN-sponsored climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021. But the richer nations managed to shunt it aside. The US even led a group of wealthier countries in blocking the creation of a loss and damage funding facility.
With this year’s catastrophic weather events, the issue of liability is back on the table with new force.
Paul Hockenos
But with this year’s catastrophic weather events, the issue of liability is back on the table with new force. It’s hard to argue with Pakistan’s Minister for Planning, Development and Reform, Ahsan Iqbal, who calls upon the industrialized countries to step up their responsibility to countries ravaged by climate change. “All the quality of life that people are enjoying in the west, someone is paying the price in the developing world,” he said on August 30.
“This is a climate crisis,” Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF’s representative in Pakistan told CNN in August.  “A climate that has been mostly done by richer countries, contributing to the crisis, and I think it is time that the world responded to support Pakistan in this time of need.”
Pakistan will receive humanitarian aid for recovery efforts – the US has pledged $30 million, the United Nations $3 million – and can draw on the internationally funded Green Climate Fund, which assists developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices. But this is not the same as compensation.
Hard sell
Even though ever more Americans support the US participating in international efforts to help reduce the effects of climate change, there is less consensus over whether the US has a responsibility to deliver climate-related financial assistance to developing economies – of any kind. In the US itself, there is barely any discussion at all about climate-related responsibility, liability, and reparations.
Thus far, only Scotland and the Wallonia province in Belgium have paid loss and damage monies. Though their contributions totaled only about one million euros a piece, they were heralded by the UN Secretary General for setting precedent. The EU as a whole is mulling it over.

Others should join them as the aggrieved nations will bring their ire and demands to the upcoming climate summit in Egypt in November, called COP 27. Should the developed world not respond, the burning issue could derail the entire summit and throw a wrench in global climate protection efforts.
The poor countries of the South have justice and fairness on their side – but, tragically, not the clout to make the just thing, namely climate justice, happen."

Water is in short supply. Markets should pay attention
A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.
The world is in desperate need of water. Drought and increasing temperatures have threatened to impact nearly every major sector of the economy, from energy to agriculture to shipping.
Markets are taking note. The S&P Global Water Index, which tracks 50 companies from around the world that are involved in water utilities, infrastructure, equipment and materials, has outperformed the S&P Global Broad Market Index by more than 3 percentage points per year since its beginning in late 2001. So far this year, the Global Water Index return has been nearly 5 percentage points higher than the S&P Global BMI.
The big picture: Europe is suffering the worst drought it has seen in at least 500 years after sweltering temperatures led to thousands of deaths across Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. European rivers hit record low water levels, interfering with crop and power production as well as shipping. The Rhine fell so low that shipping had to be severely reduced, causing supply issues in Switzerland and Germany. Yields of major crops are expected to fall by at least 10% to 20% due to water restrictions.
It’s not the only region of the world struggling with water shortages. A drought that has been enveloping the southwestern United States since 2000 marks the driest 22-year period of the past 1,200 years, a UCLA-led study found. The American Farm Bureau Federation suggests that yields could be down by as much as a third this year compared with last year because of drought and extreme heat.
Climate change could make these extreme droughts a common occurrence. A report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year found droughts in drying regions that previously occurred only once every 10 years are now happening about 1.7 times per decade, on average. If the Earth warms by another 2 degrees Celsius, the once rare occurrences will happen about 2.5 times per decade.
What it means for markets: Stress on public budgets will make it difficult for governments around the world to solve water-access and drought issues on their own. Publicly-traded companies are increasingly likely to be part of the solution, and analysts predict opportunity for upside.
“As these demands for clean water increase, companies involved in water-related business activities stand to grow in the coming years,” wrote Tianyin Cheng, a senior director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Recent reports from the World Economic Forum estimate the global water industry at $483 billion, as of mid-2022. Investors want in: There were 23 water funds launched over the last five years, with a collective $8 billion in assets, according to Morningstar data.
Common holdings in these funds include utilities like American Water Works Company
            
                (AWK), Georg Fischer AG, a Swiss firm that works on the safe transportation of water, and water technology companies like Xylem
            
                (XYL), which forecasts revenue growth around 5% annually through 2025.
Consolidated Water
            
                (CWCO), which recycles waste water into potable water, is also being watched by analysts. Its shares are up 52% this year while the broader S&P 500 is down nearly 19% over the same period.
A rising tide: On the other side of the equation lie companies that sap water resources and don’t address drought as a critical problem to their business operations. A recent analysis from environmental disclosure platform CDP and Planet Tracker, a non-profit think tank, showed listed companies could face losses of at least $225 billion from risks related to water.
Also in August, sustainability investor group Ceres announced the creation of the Valuing Water Finance Initiative, with 64 US and international investors representing a total of $9.8 trillion in assets under management. Investors include pension funds and asset managers such as Franklin Resources. Ceres says the fund will pressure companies to pay more attention to their impact on water quality and availability. Participants, they say, will consider additional steps of “escalation” like voting against directors at companies who won’t make necessary changes.
Wall Street’s big month
After a mercifully quiet summer, the stock market is going to have a lot to react to this month. Between consequential central bank decisions around the globe (and at least eight US Fed officials speaking this week alone), Big Bank CEOs testifying before Congress and some changes coming to the crypto market, investors will have a lot to digest and contend with. That’s not to mention the host of economic data that will let us know more about whether inflation is still biting, the labor market is still booming and consumers are still shopping.
Historically speaking, this isn’t a great month for markets. But September is a month of clarity. The crisp air snaps away the last of August’s haze and allows us to see what’s ahead. Here’s what we’ll be watching over the next few weeks.
Big week for central banks
The US Federal Reserve is arguably one of the most influential forces on markets right now as officials consider further interest rate hikes later this month to fight inflation. Investors will be watching closely for any clues to what it might do. Central bank decisions on hikes are expected across the globe, which are expected to have impacts on both European and US markets.
– Sept. 7: It’s a central bank bonanza as Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard and Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all give their economic outlooks. On top of that, the Fed will release its Beige Book, which describes the state of consumer spending, sentiment and housing demands in the 12 Federal Reserve districts.
Beyond the US, the Bank of Canada also publishes its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate.
– Sept. 8: The Fed fete continues as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks from the Cato Institute at 9:10 am, ET. The last time Powell spoke, from Jackson Hole, he said the economy should expect some pain on the horizon, which sent markets reeling.
The European Central Bank will also release its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate, which will be closely watched by investors globally.
–Sept. 9: This week of Fed festivities wraps with speeches from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Governor Christopher Waller.
An onslaught of data
Key economic data mapping the trajectory of US inflation comes out the following week. This is the last drop of data before the Fed meets to decide where interest rates go, and investors will be looking closely for signs that inflation could be easing.
–Sept. 13: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August is released. This measures the change in the prices of goods and services, and the Fed pays very close attention to this figure.
–Sept. 14: Producer Price Index (PPI) for August is released. This is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. It measures a change in input prices of raw, semi-finished or finished goods and services.
–Sept. 15: The Bank of England publishes its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate. In the US, retail sales for August will also be released. These are an important indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity.
All eyes on DC
The penultimate week of September is perhaps the most newsworthy. Investors have been waiting since July to see the Fed’s next move, and this week they finally meet and announce the extent to which they’ll raise rates. Wall Street CEOs will also flock to the Hill to talk banking policy, and could give an update on where they predict the economy is headed in.
–Sept. 20- 21: Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members will meet and vote on where to set the target interest rate. Traders will watch the decision closely as well as the press conference following the decision with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Any surprises could send US markets tumbling.
– Sept. 21-22: Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, Citi’s Jane Fraser, PNC’s Bill Demchak, US Bank’s Andrew Cecere and Truist’s Bill Roger all testify for their annual report to Senate and Congress. Investors will listen for any predictions on where the economy is going and for any mentions of that dreaded ‘R’ word: Recession.
Pass the chips
Here’s another development in the longstanding US-China rivalry.
The Biden administration released plans for its $50 billion investment in the US semiconductor industry on Tuesday. Aimed at shaping an important industry and countering China, the Department of Commerce announced how it would allocate its CHIPS for America Fund, part of an act signed into law in July.
According to the White House, about $28 billion of the fund will go toward grants and loans to help build facilities for advanced and cutting edge chip-making. Another $10 billion will go to expanding manufacturing for older generations of technology used in cars and communications tech like smart phones. The last $11 billion will go to research and development initiatives related to chipmaking.
The Department of Commerce will start accepting applications for the funding from companies by February and could begin distributing money by next spring.
The United States was once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing but has lost ground to other countries like China. Now, many American manufacturers import the chips that are essential to the production of cars, smartphones and medical equipment.
As my colleague Rishi Iyengar has reported, Taiwan complicates matters further. The self-governed island off China’s coast has become a diplomatic and military flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. Taiwan is critical to the global semiconductor industry, with several of the world’s top manufacturers headquartered there.
The new funding is intended to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the US and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions, reports my colleague Katie Lobosco. The current global chip shortage has limited production of new vehicles, for example, leaving Americans facing high car prices.

Data centers guzzle energy to keep cool. Could snow be the answer?
A city in Japan has found a way to cool the vast servers that support the global digital economy without fueling the climate crisis.
Bibai, in Japan’s northernmost island of Hokkaido, and its White Data Center have turned to snow.
At WDC, snow is collected and piled up in an insulated mound outside the building. Heat captured from its servers slowly melts the snow, and the water cools pipes containing antifreeze — which then flows around the data center via an AC system, keeping temperatures around 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit).
“Temperature range is controlled by combining the coldness of snow and the warmth of IT exhaust heat to keep the temperature at the right level all year round,” says WDC director Kota Honma.
The number of data centers around the world continues to grow, to keep up with the rise of streaming, cloud-based gaming, and cryptocurrency mining. But they typically consume a lot of power, and are already responsible for roughly 1% of global energy demand, according to the International Energy Agency.
The Bibai data center began experimenting with snow in 2014 with a grant from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Organization (NEDO), and according to Honma, has reduced data center cooling costs by 55%. Now a commercial entity, WDC hopes to attract business from Tokyo-based data centers.
“WDC is always air-conditioned using only 100% natural energy, without using electric cooling or thermal fuels,” Honma tells CNN Business. “Compared to the cost of renting [server] racks in Tokyo, we think we can offer them lower maintenance costs.”
Using the power of snow
There is a long-standing relationship with snow and Northern Japan’s economy. Bibai, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Tokyo, sees between eight to 10 meters of snow per year and spends 400 million yen ($2.9 million) plowing and dumping it. “This is considered a nuisance for residents … and it could actually be put to good use,” says Honma.
Roughly 200,000 tons of snow are plowed from the streets of Bibai each year, and city authorities are partnering with WDC to deliver some of that snow to its data center. With the extra cooling capacity, the goal is to scale up the center from 20 server racks to 200.
During the summer months, the snow mound is insulated with a covering of wood chips and dirt. Storing “free” cold energy falling from the sky is a no-brainer as a business opportunity, says Takahisa Tsuchiya, executive director of Bibai City’s economic department. “We always say that we should change our point of view and make the snow be on our side,” he adds.
Snow cooling is only one piece of the data center’s energy puzzle. Heat from the servers is used to warm air and water in an adjacent greenhouse, where the company is growing mushrooms and has tested other products including Japanese mustard spinach, coffee beans, abalones and sea urchins. It’s also hoping to become the first commercial eel farm in Hokkaido.
Catering to big energy hogs
The global data center cooling market is estimated to reach more than $12 billion by 2027, according to market research firm Arizton, and some big tech companies have already been chilling with cool temperatures by setting up shop in Nordic countries.

                (GOOGL) has a data center in Finland using pipes with ocean water to chill servers, aiming to reach zero carbon emissions in its data centers by 2030.
Yet when it comes to cutting energy usage, some experts say it’s more important to focus on what data these vast servers are handling. Mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, for example, requires massive amounts of electricity.
“Renewable and sustainable power and cooling systems are a second but far less optimal solution,” says Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at Ernst & Young.
The upside of data centers, Brody adds, is that they aggregate computer operations under one roof instead of dispersing them across several locations. “I’m 100% in favor of snow-cooled and other low-impact data centers, regardless of whether or not you have Bitcoin in them,” he says.

Record high temperatures continue to bake the West. Here’s how days of extreme heat are impacting life,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/us/extreme-heat-impact-us-west/index.html,"Record high temperatures continue to bake the West. Here’s how days of extreme heat are impacting life
More than 50 million people across the American West are under heat alerts Tuesday, as a prolonged heat wave continues to grip the region, prompting record high temperatures and upending daily life.
Californians have been warned to prepare for rolling blackouts and asked to conserve energy. Wildfires have ripped across the state, killing at least four people while consuming thousands of acres and dozens of structures. And a hiker died while others were rescued in Arizona after suffering heat exhaustion.
These are just a handful of the impacts stemming from extreme heat, which scientists say is getting worse because of the human-caused climate crisis. Recent heat records have far outpaced cool records, with more than 300 all-time highs recorded this year, compared to just three all-time cool records.
Extreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory by planet-warming emissions, making the Pacific Northwest’s historic 2021 heat wave, for instance, “virtually impossible” without the climate crisis, scientists found.
Here’s a look at some of the effects of recent weeks’ heat across the West.
Californians brace for rolling blackouts
Residents of the Golden State have been told to prepare for the possibility of power outages Tuesday evening as record demand threatens to outstrip the power supply while heat records are broken across the state.
California Independent Operator System (Cal ISO), which oversees the power grid for most of the state, said it expects to reach a stage 3 emergency level by 5:30 p.m., when peak demand is expected to reach an all-time high. A stage 3 alert is the final step before rotating power outages are implemented.
The president of the operator of most of California’s power grid urged residents to conserve energy after 4 p.m., calling the efforts “absolutely essential,” per a news release Monday.
Forecasted demand “is at all-time record levels and the potential for rotating outages has increased significantly,” said Elliot Mainzer of the California Independent Systems Operator.
About 9,500 Pacific Gas and Electric customers in the San Francisco Bay Area were without power as of 1 pm, according to utility spokesperson Deanna Contreras. That number was down from a peak of about 45,000 customers out of power Monday at 7 p.m.
The state is seeing record temperatures, including in Sacramento, which had an all-time high of 115 degrees Tuesday. That followed 114 degrees Monday, the city’s hottest September day on record. San Francisco International Airport hit 97 degrees, a daily record, and that city remains under a heat advisory Tuesday.
Further south, Death Valley could hit 125 degrees Tuesday, which would tie its hottest September temperature on record. (Despite an unofficial reading of an even higher temperature, Death Valley on Friday officially only reached 124 degrees. And its September record is still short of Earth’s all-time record for the month: 126 degrees, set in 1950 in Mecca, California.)
If rotating outages occur this week in California, they would likely last at least 40 minutes each before power is restored for the first set of impacted customers and goes out for the next group. Utilities would try to keep outages as short as possible, Mainzer assured customers, but operators anticipate power supply deficits between 400 and 3,400 megawatts between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Tuesday.
Overall demand is forecast to hit 51,145 megawatts, higher than the previous record demand of 50,270 megawatts, set in July 2006.
Fish died in a Utah reservoir
And California’s regional neighbors are toying with record high temperatures, too. Billings, Montana, also hit 100 degrees on Monday, the first time the city has hit 100 degrees twice in the same September.
And Salt Lake City, Utah, hit 104 degrees Monday – the city’s hottest September day on record and its 32nd day in 2022 with temperatures of at least 100 degrees, another record.
In fact, temperatures have been so high in Utah this summer that wildlife biologists have attributed the heat and low water levels to the deaths of fish late last month: Roughly 80 kokanee salmon were confirmed dead on August 26 at Lost Creek Reservoir, about 70 miles northeast of Salt Lake City, according to Faith Jolley, a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, though she noted that was “quite a small amount of the total fish there.”
Still, with “the recent heat wave and record number of hot days this summer and lower water levels, water temperatures at Lost Creek are just starting to reach the thermal maximum for what kokanee can tolerate,” Jolley said in an email.
Water levels in lakes and reservoirs fall during a drought, she explained, and at a lower water level, those bodies of water heat more quickly. That’s bad for fish, Jolley said, because warm water holds less oxygen than cooler water. Together, the high temperatures and lack of oxygen can result in poor fish growth, disease and even death.
Wildfires kill 4 in California
Persistent heat has helped fuel wildfires across the region this summer, and that remained true this holiday weekend, as fires consumed thousands of acres, sending residents fleeing.
Two people were killed in the Fairview Fire in Riverside County in Southern California, with the fast-moving blaze fueled by parched vegetation. The fire ignited Monday afternoon and quickly burned 2,000 acres, destroying at least seven structures and damaging several more, per Cal Fire, and forcing the evacuations of at least 5,000 homes.
Fire officials have yet to identify those who died in the fire or the circumstances in which they perished.
Meanwhile, two women, ages 66 and 73, died in the Mill Fire in Northern California’s Siskiyou County. That fire had burned more than 4,200 acres as of Tuesday morning and destroyed 117 structures. Elsewhere, the Mountain Fire had burned another 11,700 acres.
Prolonged drought has left behind a “huge amount of dead fuel,” Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jon Heggie told CNN Sunday, calling the conditions “extremely dangerous.”
“All these fires now have receptive fuel beds to burn,” he said. “Now, when anything gets started, it has that potential for exponential growth in a short period of time just because everything is so tinder dry.”
Two Arizona hikers die, five others injured
A group of hikers had to be rescued Monday after they suffered exhaustion while venturing about 40 miles north of Phoenix as temperatures hit 109 degrees – about six degrees above average, per the National Weather Service.
Tragically, one of the hikers, a man in his 20s, was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital, a spokesperson for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office said. Five others were treated at the Spur Cross Trailhead.
The group had run out of water and gotten lost, per the Scottsdale Fire Department, which urged would-be hikers to plan ahead, bring water and know the signs of heat exhaustion.
On Sunday, a 59-year-old woman died after becoming disoriented and losing consciousness while hiking down a trail in Grand Canyon National Park.
“Trip members attempted resuscitation efforts without success,” a release from the park said, noting that high temperatures in the inner canyon were well over 100 degrees that day.

Pakistan’s melting glaciers are ‘erupting’ and worsening floods,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/asia/pakistan-flooding-glacier-outbursts-climate-intl/index.html,"Pakistan’s melting glaciers are ‘erupting’ and worsening floods
Pakistan is home to more glaciers than anywhere in the world outside the polar regions, but as the climate warms, it’s becoming more vulnerable to sudden outbursts of melting glacier water that have the power to bring widespread destruction to its people.
The country’s chief meteorologist has warned that this year alone, Pakistan has seen triple the usual amount of glacial lake outbursts – a sudden release of water from a lake fed by glacier melt – that can cause catastrophic flooding.
Sardar Sarfaraz from Pakistan’s Meterological Department said Thursday that there have been 16 such incidents in the country’s northern Gilgit-Baltistan region in 2022, compared with just five or six seen in previous years.
“Such incidents occur after glaciers melt due to [a] rise in temperature,” Sarfaraz told Reuters, adding: “Climate change is the basic reason for such things.”
Melting glaciers is one of the clearest, most visible signs of the climate crisis and one of its most direct consequences.
It’s not yet clear how much Pakistan’s current flooding crisis might be connected to glacial melt. But unless planet-warming emissions are reined in, Sarfaraz suggests that the country’s glaciers will continue to melt at speed.
“Global warming will not stop until we curtail greenhouse gasses and if global warming does not stop, these climate change effects will be on the rise,” he said.
Pakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, according to European Union data, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.
That vulnerability has been on display for months, with record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in the country’s northern mountains triggering floods that have killed at least 1,191 people – including 399 children – since mid-June.
New flooding fears
On Thursday, southern Pakistan braced for more flooding as a surge of water flowed down the Indus river, compounding the devastation in a country a third of which is already inundated by the climate change induced disaster.
The United Nations has appealed for $160 million to help with what it has called an “unprecedented climate catastrophe.”
“We’re on a high alert as water arriving downstream from northern flooding is expected to enter the province over the next few days,” the spokesman of the Sindh provincial government, Murtaza Wahab, told Reuters.
Wahab said a flow of some 600,000 cubic feet per second was expected to swell the Indus, testing its flood defences.
Pakistan has received nearly 190% more rain than the 30-year average in the quarter from June to August, totalling 390.7mm (15.38 inches).
Sindh, with a population of 50 million, has been hardest hit, getting 466% more rain than the 30-year average.
Some parts of the province look like an inland sea with only occasional patches of trees or raised roads breaking the surface of the murky flood waters.
Hundreds of families have taken refugee on roads, the only dry land in sight for many of them.
Villagers rushed to meet a Reuters news team passing along one road near the town of Dadu on Thursday, begging for food or other help.
The floods have swept away homes, businesses, infrastructure and roads. Standing and stored crops have been destroyed and some two million acres (809,371 hectares) of farm land inundated.
The government says 33 million people, or 15% of the 220 million population, have been affected.
The National Disaster Management Authority said some 480,030 people have been displaced and are being looked after in camps but even those not forced from their homes face peril.
“More than three million children are in need of humanitarian assistance and at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition due to the most severe flooding in Pakistan’s recent history,” the UN children’s agency warned.
The World Health Organization said that more than 6.4 million people were in dire need of humanitarian aid.
Aid has started to arrive on planes loaded with food, tents and medicines, mostly from China, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
Aid agencies have asked the government to allow food imports from neighboring India, across a largely closed border that has for decades been a front line of confrontation between the nuclear armed rivals.
The government has not indicated it is willing to open the border to Indian food imports.

Major economies accused of ‘backsliding’ on emissions as G20 climate meet ends in failure,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/world/g20-climate-communique-intl/index.html,"Major economies accused of ‘backsliding’ on emissions as G20 climate meet ends in failure
Some of the world’s major economies are “backsliding” on their emissions commitments, the UK’s climate delegate Alok Sharma said on Thursday, a day after a meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) nations failed to adopt a joint communiqué at climate talks.
Objections to language on climate targets and the war in Ukraine prevented a joint communiqué from being issued at the G20 ministerial meeting in Bali on Wednesday, diplomatic sources said.
Sharma, president of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) and head of the British delegation in Bali, told Reuters the response from the G20 that accounts for 80% of global emissions was “incredibly worrying.”
“It is certainly the case that what we did see was a number of countries backsliding on the commitments that they made in Paris and in Glasgow,” he said in an interview, without singling out any nations.
“Unless the G20 are willing to act on the commitments they have made in Glasgow I am afraid the prospect of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach is going to slip away very, very fast.”
G20 climate ministers met on the Indonesian resort island for the talks as extreme weather events — fires, floods and heat waves — pummel several parts of the world, including unprecedented flooding in Pakistan that has killed more than 1,100 people.
Science shows that such extreme weather events are attributable to human-caused climate change and will only increase in severity and frequency as the globe edges closer to the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
In comments ahead of November’s COP27 in Egypt, Sharma said the position some countries had taken in Bali was unacceptable.
“The big emitters absolutely need to look these climate vulnerable countries in the eye and say they are doing absolutely everything they can to deliver on the commitments they have made,” he said.
Indonesia’s Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar had started the meeting by urging countries to cut emissions and prevent the planet from being pushed to a point “where no future will be sustainable.”
Siti had earlier said she hoped a joint communiqué would be signed by the end of the day Wednesday, but made no mention of it in her closing press conference."
First on CNN: The rise in extreme heat is taking a toll on our well-being. It’s about to get worse,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/world/extreme-heat-wellbeing-climate/index.html,"First on CNN: The rise in extreme heat is taking a toll on our well-being. It’s about to get worse
Extreme heat is on the rise around the world, and a new study shows it is taking a significant toll not just on our physical health but also our sense of well-being.
A new analysis by Gallup in collaboration with Citi, shared first with CNN, found that people who experienced extreme heat – days that were significantly hotter than normal – also reported a decrease in their sense of well-being around the same time. On average, the global population experienced three times as many extreme heat days in 2020 than it did in 2008, Gallup reported, and well-being decreased globally by 6.5% in that time as well.
Researchers also found that because the climate crisis is pushing temperatures even hotter, global well-being could decrease by another 17% by the end of this decade.
“This study is a new way of looking at how climate change impacts humans around the world,” said Nicole Willcoxon, Gallup’s research director for the project. “And while there are many factors that impact people’s well-being, this study demonstrates that there is a clear relationship between rising temperatures and declines in life evaluation.”
Extreme heat has been relentless across the Northern Hemisphere this summer. In May, Pakistan and India faced scorching temperatures that scientists say will become 100 times more likely as the climate crisis advances. Then in July, Europe and the UK faced record-breaking heat. At the same time, blistering temperatures continue to rip across China and parts of the United States – including the West, which is gearing up for a searing heatwave this week.
Gallup’s global study shows how much of an impact that heat has on our lives, whether or not we realize it.
Over 15 years, Gallup surveyed 1.75 million people across 160 countries and asked them about their sense of well-being. Using temperature data from NASA, researchers looked at extreme heat in the 30 days before respondents were interviewed and then compared that to their life-evaluation responses.
A single extreme heat day was associated with an average well-being decrease of 0.56%.
“It’s important set of findings for leaders to consider as they’re evaluating the impact of climate change,” Willcoxon said. “I think there’s a lot of focus on the economic effects, the focus on what kind of extreme weather might occur – but then, what is the outcome of that and how are people going to be impacted?”
Unequal impact
The impact on well-being is more significant among older generations than young, Gallup researchers found, and among those living in countries with developing economies – where people are less equipped to handle the economic toll of the climate crisis – such as China and Brazil. Over the past decade, these countries have been wracked by environmental justice issues and climate change-fueled extreme weather events.
The report also noted people living in the southernmost regions of many nations are at increasing risk of sweltering temperatures and its associated decline in well-being, including residents along the US Gulf Coast as well as China, both of which experienced at least 10 high-heat days in the month prior being surveyed.
Researchers also linked warming temperatures and related disasters like drought to major conflicts and food insecurity – both of which can propel people from poorer and hotter countries to migrate to wealthier nations in cooler climates.
When Gallup surveyed the Mekong River Delta region in Vietnam, for instance, they saw life ratings declined 11% between April 2015 and June 2016 – a time when the region suffered its worst drought in decades. As the region dried up, saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels devastated their cropland, which increased food insecurity and exacted a toll on the economic health of the region.
“The [available] climate research shows that there’s a clear risk for mass migration, social divides and inequality increasing, potential food crises and things like that,” Willcoxon said. “While this study didn’t directly measure those things, we think it’s a clear implication out of the [available] research showing that if well-being continues to drop at the levels that we project, it could exacerbate these issues even more deeply, or that it’s a piece of the puzzle that we’re missing at this point of what is the human toll.”
Mental health in a warmer future
While the report found well-being could fall by another 17% over the next eight years, researchers said that forecast doesn’t take into account the world’s ability to adapt to the climate crisis and recover from extreme heat.
Robbie Parks, environmental epidemiologist and incoming assistant professor at Columbia University’s Climate School, said the poll is an effective way to prod decisionmakers to “pull the right levers” on climate action.
“While people understand that climate change is awful in so many ways, when people start to understand how it affects their daily lives – and particularly their health and well-being – I find that is a really good stimulant to political motivation for action and change,” Parks, who is not involved with the research, told CNN.
The World Meteorological Organization recently reported an extreme weather event had occurred every day on average somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, a five-fold increase in frequency over that period. And polls have helped illuminate how extreme weather and environmental degradation is affecting moods. A Gallup survey earlier this year found that only 39% of Americans were satisfied with the quality of environment in the US.
“We’ve got a lot to build on here,” Willcoxon said. “As we project that we’re going to see a lot more high temperature days and extreme weather events, looking at that and tracking that over time will be really important and key to providing the data that policymakers and leaders need to help provide solutions for this issue.”"

Pakistan was already struggling when the devastating monsoon rains hit.
This year, economic and political crises have converged in the South Asian nation of more than 230 million, as food and fuel prices soared and former leader Imran Khan was forced from office.
Now its reeling with the worst floods in living memory.
Swaths of Pakistan are now underwater after experiencing the heaviest rains on record with little reprieve since mid-June. Some areas have seen five times their normal levels of monsoonal rain.
More than 1,100 people have died and 33 million people are impacted – that’s more than the population of Texas.
Torrents of water have smashed through entire villages and farmland, razing buildings and wiping out crops. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies shared with CNN show how communities have been wiped out, leaving behind little more than bare Earth and dust.
Pakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, European Union data shows, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. It’s paying a hefty price, not only with lives but destroyed schools, homes and bridges.
Officials estimate the total bill will be $10 billion. The recovery could take years, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Pakistan has said. And chances are any recovery will be interrupted by yet another disaster.

In pictures: 'Unprecedented' flooding in Pakistan
“We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Tuesday.
“And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change.”
The stark inequity of the climate crisis, which is bearing down hardest on nations that have historically had the least to do with causing it, is raising questions over who should pay for it, particularly for the damage that countries like Pakistan are coming to terms with.
The United Nations issued an appeal for $160 million in emergency funds on Tuesday, barely enough to scratch the surface of the $10 billion needed. Countries from the United States to Turkey are pitching in with aid, rescue helicopters, food and medical supplies. Yet the need is greater than what the world is giving.
These devastating scenes and eye-watering recovery costs are what the climate crisis looks like at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming since industrialization.
But the world is on track for warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius, analyses show, and scientists warn every fraction of a degree of warming will worsen the impacts of the crisis.
Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist with the group Climate Analytics, who is based in Islamabad, told CNN that Pakistan was in a Catch-22 situation. The country needs money to adapt to the crisis, yet because it has to pay for the damage that extreme weather is already causing it will struggle to find the funds it needs to adjust.
“What is happening right now at 1.2 degrees centigrade of warming is not because of the poor people in Pakistan,” he said. “They are not responsible for it, and this brings out the issue of climate justice in a very clear form.”
He added that Pakistan, like so many developing nations, needed to bring more people out of poverty, a difficult thing to do in the midst of back-to-back extreme weather events with such little financial support from abroad.
Saeed said Pakistan was in “a position to present a strong case” at the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt this November that other nations should help it pay to pick up the pieces. Developed and developing nations have remained generally divided over the issue for years.
The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing nations to help their transitions away from fossil fuels, but also to help them adapt to climate change. That amount has never been delivered in full.
More controversial is the issue of who should pay for the destruction. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the US was one of several advanced nations that showed opposition to obligatory payments for “loss and damages” – essentially climate compensation – particularly for schemes based on historic responsibility.
Historically, the US accounts for the most greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

Republicans voted ‘no’ on the climate bill. Their states will get billions of dollars from it anyway,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/republican-states-benefit-climate-law/index.html,"Republicans voted ‘no’ on the climate bill. Their states will get billions of dollars from it anyway
Republicans in Congress unanimously opposed Democrats’ $750 billion climate and health law, deriding it as a payout to “elite” and “liberal” states. But the states those Republicans represent will soon see a financial windfall in the form of billions of dollars to decarbonize the country, experts told CNN.
Republican rhetoric decried the law as one that would kill energy jobs, but clean energy jobs are booming in red states. Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio are some of the states that saw the biggest growth in clean energy jobs last year, as companies there invested in building electric vehicles and cheap zero-emissions energy like wind, solar and batteries to store it.
More than $370 billion of the law will go to tax credits for clean electricity, vehicles and energy efficient appliances. And that money will trickle down to Democrat- and Republican-controlled states alike, said Bob Keefe, executive director of nonpartisan clean energy group E2.
“It’s going to be harder for red states to say clean energy jobs are bogus and that it’s something for California when it’s something that’s happening in their backyards,” Keefe told CNN.
The law goes far beyond financing for solar and wind energy. There’s also money for hydrogen fuel and funds to incentivize power plants to capture their planet-warming emissions before they hit the air. It also contains billions of dollars to fund a new program that will crack down on the fossil fuel industry’s methane emissions – a powerful greenhouse gas that scientists say must be controlled.
Experts told CNN all of this translates to a windfall for traditional energy states, even those with state and federal officials who opposed the bill.
“At the end of the day, a climate bill has to be an energy bill, and Texas is an energy state,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at the University of Texas Austin. “I think it has the potential to super-charge an industry that’s already running hot in the state.”
‘A gift … to rich, liberal elites’
As lawmakers were debating the climate and clean energy bill, Republicans from states including Texas and Oklahoma described the legislation as an expensive boondoggle that would raise prices and kill jobs.
The bill “could put more than 100,000 American jobs at risk and inflict a severely disproportionate economic impact on natural gas producing states, like Oklahoma,” Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said in a statement explaining his “no” vote.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called the bill “a gift to radical environmentalists and to rich, liberal elites,” while fellow Texas senator John Cornyn said it would “drive energy costs through the roof.”
CNN reached out to the offices of all four senators in Texas and Oklahoma and asked if they thought the people and businesses in their states should not take advantage of the funds. Only Cornyn’s spokesperson responded, referring CNN back to his floor speech opposing the bill.
Despite the rhetoric of Republican leaders in Texas and Oklahoma, the states are already have booming clean energy industries that are poised to get much more funding and investment from the climate law.
Oklahoma, the state with the third-most installed wind capacity in the country, recently installed a massive wind farm that will generate close to 1 gigawatt of energy alone – powering hundreds of thousands of homes. Wind is generating close to 40% of the electricity in the state, and nearly 60% of the electricity in Iowa.
Earlier this year, CNN spoke with Oklahoma farmers who chose to lease their land out for wind turbines, and many said they appreciated the extra source of income.
Texas has the second-largest number of clean energy jobs in the nation behind California, and its clean energy sector is growing faster than California’s, according to analysis from E2.
“The [Republican] political sentiment is this is bad, but actually a lot of money is going to flow to Texas,” Michael Webber, a professor and energy resources expert at the University of Texas, Austin. “The biggest most obvious one that people will notice is the growth of wind and solar.”
Texas has far and away installed the most wind energy capacity of any state; 36.8 gigawatts, followed by Iowa and Oklahoma. Nonpartisan clean energy nonprofit RMI showed that Texas’ wind capacity is more than many major countries – save for China, the US, Germany and India. Even before the climate law was passed, Texas had over 20 new wind projects in the pipeline to be installed from 2022 through 2024.
Texas is also second behind California in US states that produce the most solar energy. That renewable energy has helped keep the power on and energy prices low during heat waves earlier this year, Rhodes said.
Beyond wind turbines and solar farms, Texas’ massive oil and gas sector will likely be impacted by parts of the climate bill including a program to clamp down on excessive methane emissions. Republicans have opposed the fee oil and gas producers will have to pay on excessive emissions, but the program was also designed with more than $1 billion in incentives, grants and loans for companies and communities to tighten up leaks and offset the cost of the fees.
It will ultimately be up to state officials to decide whether to accept federal money for the methane program. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether they’re planning to accept or reject the funding.
The methane fee is “game changing,” said Dave Allen, an engineering professor and natural gas expert at UT Austin. And it will also push companies to make sure they are not wasting product they can sell.
“You’ve just made that economic inventive enormously greater,” Allen told CNN.
America’s new EV belt
States all over the country will see benefits from new investment in Democrats’ climate bill, experts said. East Coast states are investing aggressively in offshore wind, while others in the Midwest and Southeast are seeing a boom in electric vehicle manufacturing.
“When you look at what was the hottest growth area for clean energy jobs last year, it was hands down EVs,” Keefe told CNN.
While some of that growth is happening in traditional automaker states like Michigan and Ohio, there’s massive EV investment from companies happening in Republican-controlled states like Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.
CNN reported Monday that Honda and Korean battery giant LG Energy Solution will together build a $4.4 billion US factory to build batteries to power its electric vehicles, though it hasn’t yet announced the factory’s location. Ford is building a massive plant in Tennessee and another one in Kentucky to build EVs and batteries, Mercedes Benz is manufacturing EV batteries in Alabama, and Hyundai is building a Georgia battery plant as well.
All these announcements paint a picture: “The Southeast by far is becoming the EV hub of America,” Keefe said. “Certainly, we’re going to see growth in the auto industry generally as every automaker shifts to electric vehicles.”"
A prolonged and record heat wave builds over the West this week,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/weather/record-heat-west-labor-day-forecast-tropics/index.html,"A prolonged and record heat wave builds over the West this week
Some of the hottest temperatures of the year are on the way for the West Coast and possibly staying dangerously hot through Labor Day as a mega heat wave builds in for the long term.
More than 55 million people are currently under heat alerts from Southern California through the San Joaquin Valley and into portions of the Northwest, including 20 of the most populated cities up and down the West Coast.
“Temperatures could exceed 110F in parts of the Southwest, where an excessive heat warning is currently in effect,” the Weather Prediction Center wrote.
The most dire areas will be in the Southwest, where the heat will be the most intense.
“Some records may be broken but record max temps are very high at this time of the year,” said the NWS office in Los Angeles. “Record breaking or not, this prolonged heat wave is going to be very dangerous.”

Prolonged heat wave for the Southwest
The kind of heat that will be felt from San Diego to Los Angeles to even Phoenix will be difficult to endure even for the locals.
“This heat may be record breaking and will produce a very high risk of heat illness,” said the NWS office in Los Angeles. “Triple digit heat is expected for many valley and mountain locations. Even hotter conditions are expected over the Labor Day weekend into early next week.”
The heat will begin Tuesday, with a gradual warm-up each day through the week, and it will peak by the end of the week.
The reason for the extreme conditions is a stubborn area of high pressure sitting over the region, creating what meteorologists call a “heat dome.”
This intense heat dome causes high pressure to act as a lid on the atmosphere. As hot air attempts to escape, the lid forces it back down, warming even more as it sinks.
The result will be intense summer heat, running 10-15 degrees above normal.
“Excessive Heat warnings are in effect for almost the entire forecast area starting Wednesday and continuing all the way through next Monday,” noted the NWS office in Los Angeles.
The forecast shows temperatures of 110-115 degrees in the deserts and San Fernando Valley, with temperatures running 90-100 along the coast. That’s hot enough to potentially break records there as well.
Watch: 5 things to do to keep cool in a heat wave
In Phoenix, the “dry heat” will give way to more humid conditions by Thursday and Friday.
This will cause the actual temperature to fall slightly, but the NWS in Phoenix warns that the humidity could actually make it feel hotter.
In Southern California, a few morning clouds Friday morning could edge in, giving a brief reprieve from the heat – but it will be short-lived.
“There will be renewed warming leading to a kiln-like day on Sunday,” said the NWS office in Los Angeles.
Even downtown Los Angeles could hit 100 degrees on Sunday with Death Valley potentially hitting 125.
This heat extends all the way into the San Joaquin Valley, where record-breaking temperatures are possible.
“Confidence is increasing in this being the hottest temperatures so far this year,” said the NWS office in Hanford, California.
“Record high temperatures are possible beginning Thursday with the best chances for record highs on Sunday and Monday when the peak of the heat is expected.”
The Labor Day holiday will be one of the hottest days of the event, with the heat potentially lasting through much of next week – making heat-related illness a huge concern amidst the oppressive heat.
Record heat for the Pacific Northwest
Maximum heat for interior portions of the Pacific Northwest will be felt through much of this week, as high temperatures soar, including in Seattle, Portland and Boise.
“Daytime highs between 10-20F above normal and nighttime lows between 15-20F above normal are likely,” said the Weather Prediction Center.
The heat is expected to peak on Wednesday with highs in the 90s and potentially hitting the triple digits for portions of the Western Basin, near Spokane, Washington – even breaking records.

“Highs are slated to top out upwards of 10-15 degrees above average as several locations could test daily records for max temperatures,” said the National Weather Service in Seattle.
Near Boise, Idaho, temperatures could reach 20 degrees above normal, with record heat expected through Tuesday.
And in Seattle, high temperatures are expected to top out in the upper 80s to low 90s.
The extreme heat should break by the end of the week, resulting in temperatures back in the 70s for Labor Day weekend.
A Labor Day tropical system could be on the horizon
The tropics are also heating up ahead of the holiday weekend.
The National Hurricane Center is actively watching two areas in the Atlantic for tropical development, as we will most likely have our next named tropical system before Labor Day.
An area of low pressure several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles has the greatest potential of becoming “Danielle.”
“Although environmental conditions are only marginally conducive, some gradual development of this system is expected over the next several days and a tropical depression is likely to form later this week,” said the NHC.
There’s an 80% chance of this area becoming a tropical system within the next five days, according to the NHC.
Forecast models take this system to the west, staying north of the Caribbean Islands and curving to the north, avoiding the Bahamas.
The storm should stay out to sea as of now, but things could change between now and next week.
Even though the storm should stay out to sea, there will still be implications for the Eastern Seaboard during the Labor Day weekend.
The storm could create breezy conditions and even strong rip currents for the East Coast. How close the storm gets to the US will determine just how strong the winds and rip currents will be. Closer to the coast they will be stronger, farther from the coast they will be weaker.
The NHC is no longer tracking the area in the western Caribbean for development. However, that region is still producing clouds and rain that will pump tropical moisture into the Texas coast. That will increase the rain chances in South Texas through the Labor Day weekend.
How to prepare for hurricane season
Another area to watch is a tropical wave just off the coast of Africa. This area could also become a tropical depression during the next few days though its life span could be short-lived.
“By late this week, the disturbance is forecast to move over cooler waters and further development is not expected,” said the NHC.

"Dangerous heat waves to at least triple across the world by 2100, study says",https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/world/heat-health-climate-projection-emissions-intl/index.html,"Dangerous heat waves to at least triple across the world by 2100, study says
The dangerous levels of heat that have scorched swathes of the northern hemisphere this summer are likely to hit most of the world between three and 10 times more often by the turn of the century, as the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate, a new study has found.
That increase is projected to happen in mid-latitude countries, like the US, China, Japan and those in Western Europe, according to the study, published in Communications Earth & Environment on Thursday by researchers at Harvard University and the University of Washington. “Dangerous heat” is defined as 39.4 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) and above.
By 2050, the number of days of dangerous heat in this region will more than double.
Deadly heat waves are currently rare in the mid-latitudes, but they are likely to start happening annually in this region. Chicago, for example, is projected to see a 16-fold increase in dangerous heatwaves by 2100, the study shows.
The situation will be even worse in the tropics, where people could be exposed to dangerous heat most days of the year. Days of “extremely dangerous heat” — which is defined as 51C (124F) — could double. Experts say those levels of heat push the limits of human survivability.
The projections were made under the assumption that average global temperatures will rise by 2 degrees Celsius, a cap set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The agreement says that a lower goal of 1.5C of warming is preferable, and there is growing momentum for the world to keep to 1.5C by making deeper and quicker cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.
“The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,” said lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello from Harvard University in a press release. “For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions.”
The study used the heat index, which considers both air temperature and humidity to measure the impact on heat on humans.
“These standards were first created for people working indoors in places like boiler rooms — they were not thought of as conditions that would happen in outdoor, ambient environments. But we are seeing them now,” Vargas Zeppetello said.
The world’s nations agreed at international climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year to come to this year’s talks in Egypt with emissions reductions plans that align with the Paris Agreement. Several countries have missed deadlines to submit their updated plans.
The authors of the study said the world must find ways to adapt to the changing levels of heat to avoid a spike in illnesses, especially among elderly people, those who work outdoor and those with lower incomes.
Several European countries are poorly set up to deal with extreme heat. In the UK, for example, few people have air conditioning, trains were canceled and an airport runway melted during a days-long heat wave, where temperatures surpassed 40C for the first time on record.
The study looked at predictions from existing global climate models, projections for human population increases, and the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions to establish how much and how quickly temperatures were expected to rise.
They also estimated that there was only a 0.1% chance of limiting warming to 1.5C by 2100, and that the world will likely approach 2C of warming as soon as 2050. Many countries and businesses are aiming to achieve net zero – where greehouse gas emissions are no greater than those removed from the atmosphere – by that same year.
“These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent,” Vargas Zeppetello said. “This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.”"
China’s worst heat wave on record is crippling power supplies. How it reacts will impact us all,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/china/china-sichuan-power-crunch-climate-change-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"China’s worst heat wave on record is crippling power supplies. How it reacts will impact us all
Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.
For weeks now, a power crunch caused by a record heat wave and accompanying drought has wreaked havoc across Sichuan, a province home to 80 million people in southwestern China.
It’s dimmed skyscrapers, shut factories, darkened subways, and plunged homes and offices into rolling blackouts, forcing air conditioning to be unplugged – and killed thousands of poultry and fish at farms hit by electricity cuts.
The impact has been felt far and wide, from the neighboring mega city of Chongqing and the eastern provinces along the Yangtze River to the financial hub of Shanghai – where the iconic skyline went dark this week to save energy.
In a country that prides itself on economic growth and stability, the acute power shortage has come as a shock to residents who in recent decades have grown used to improved living conditions and infrastructure.
To many, extended power cuts revive memories of the distant past – a bygone era before China’s economic rise ushered in its glitzy metropolises and lifted millions out of poverty.
And now, climate change is threatening to disrupt that sense of security and economic growth.
The ongoing heat wave is the worst China has seen since records began more than 60 years ago. It has stretched over 70 days, sweeping through large swathes of the country and smashing temperature records at hundreds of weather stations.
The sheer size of China’s economy and population means any major disruption to its power supply can cause massive loss and suffering.
“These so-called extreme weather events will have more impact on our lives and electricity supply,” said Li Shuo, climate adviser with Greenpeace in Beijing. “And perhaps we all need to reconsider whether these extreme events will become the new normal.”
Experts say the Sichuan power crunch is an example that China’s energy system is far less robust than it needs to be to face the growing challenges from climate change.
Some believe the industry is heading in the right direction toward reform, while others worry it will turn to building more coal-fired power plants to secure energy supply – and risk undermining China’s pledges to reach peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.
How did the power crunch happen?
Located along the upper reaches of the Yangtze, China’s longest and largest river, Sichuan is famous for its rich water resources and relies mostly on hydropower.
Amid scorching temperatures and a prolonged drought, reservoirs across Sichuan are drying up – crippling the hydropower stations that account for nearly 80% of the province’s power generation capacity.
This month, Sichuan has seen its hydroelectricity capacity plunge by 50%, according to the state grid. Meanwhile, the unrelenting heat wave has pushed power demand to unprecedented highs, as residents and businesses blast their air conditioning to stay cool.
“China’s electricity demand has been incredibly flat in the past, because so much of it has come from the industry, not from households or services. Now with air conditioning becoming more common, the demand is becoming higher,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki, Finland (CREA).
“At the same time, rains are becoming more errant. Heavy rains and periods of drought make hydropower much less reliable as a source of available capacity during those peaks.”
To make matters worse, Sichuan is traditionally a huge exporter of power during the rainy season, sending about a third of its hydropower generation to provinces in eastern China, according to David Fishman, an analyst on Chinese energy at consultancy The Lantau Group.
Despite its crippled power generation capacity, Sichuan must still honor its export contracts with other provinces, which Fishman said could “be really hard to get out of.”
“But even if they could, the generating facilities in Sichuan were built to export power to the east coast,” he said. “They don’t really have great connectivity to the rest of the Sichuan grid. They were never intended to serve Sichuan power consumption needs.”
‘Quenching a thirst with poison’
To ease the energy crunch, Sichuan is firing up its coal power plants, raising concerns among environmentalists about the potential increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
Sichuan Guang’an Power Generation, the region’s biggest coal-fired power plant, has been operating at full capacity for 21 consecutive days. Its electricity generation for August is expected to jump 313% from a year earlier, the company said.
The province is also mining more coal. Sichuan Coal Industry Group, its largest coal miner, has more than doubled its thermal coal production since mid-August. And last week, Sichuan opened its first national coal reserve.
Nationwide, the daily consumption of coal at power plants was up 15% in the first two weeks of August compared with the same period last year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
Last week, Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng said the government would step up support for coal plants to ensure stable power supply.
While the jump in coal consumption is likely a temporary fix, Li, the Greenpeace adviser, feared the hydropower crisis could be used by coal interest groups to lobby for more coal plants.
“There is a possibility that power shortages caused by future extreme weather events might become a new motivation for China to approve more (coal-fired power) projects,” he said.
Last year, after a coal shortage caused a series of power outages across China, the government began to signal a renewed focus on “energy security.” By the last quarter of the year, new-approved coal capacity surged back, especially in state-owned enterprises, Greenpeace said in a report published last month.
In the first quarter of this year, provincial governments approved plans to add a total of 8.63 gigawatts of new coal power plants, nearly half the amount seen in all of 2021, according to the report.
“Energy security has become a sort of code word for coal, rather than for reliable supply of energy,” the report said.
Yu Aiqun, China researcher at Global Energy Monitor, likened turning to coal – the largest cause of global warming – for energy security to “quenching a thirst with poison.”
“China has an obsession with coal power – there is a very strong sense of dependence. Whenever an energy problem occurs, it always tries to seek answer from coal power …This is running in the opposite direction from its climate goals,” she said.
‘Big challenge’
China’s response to its energy crisis will have an impact on the rest of the world. The country of 1.4 billion people is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, accounting for 27% of global emissions.
But some analysts say boosting coal capacity is only part of China’s answer to the much-needed energy reform.
Following the power shortages last year, the Chinese government has taken important measures to increase the flexibility of pricing and the profitability of clean energy, said Myllyvirta with CREA.
“The big challenge in China’s system is the grid is being operated in a very rigid way,” he said. “Different provinces aren’t sharing their capacity and using their capacity in an optimal way to to balance the loads within the region.”
Therefore, the need to build more thermal power plants can be significantly reduced if China’s electricity grid can be managed more efficiently and flexibly, Myllyvirta said.
Apart form new coal power, China is also stepping up construction of renewable energy – its installed solar and wind energy capacity now accounts for 35-40% of the global total.
Fishman, the energy consultant, said the new coal power plants are not necessarily going to be used; instead, they were built as backup for the fast expanding renewable energy sector – in case it runs into problems, like the ongoing drought in Sichuan.
“Capacity doesn’t equal generation. The capacity being there creates a lot of optionality and flexibility for all these other (renewable energy sources) they’re building.” he said. “For now, I see the coal capacity additions, as for the most part, targeted at being able to support wind and solar.”
Fishman said China’s power system planners are aware of the challenges they face, and that the industry overall is moving “in the right direction.”
The record heat wave and the power crunch in Sichuan highlight the need to reform the grid system, he said. “Because without them, this would be an event that could happen every five or 10 years, and it would be crippling every five or 10 years – or maybe even more frequently,” he said."
"Record-breaking heat wave in Europe will be the norm by 2035, analysis shows",https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/europe/record-heat-climate-analysis-summer-2035-intl-scli/index.html,"Record-breaking heat wave in Europe will be the norm by 2035, analysis shows
The record-breaking heat wave that swept across Europe this year will become the “average” summer by 2035, even if all countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by as much as they have pledged to, according to an analysis published Thursday.
The analysis by the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre, commissioned by the country’s Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG), looked at how quickly temperatures are changing across the region using historical records of mean summer temperatures since 1850, and comparing them against model predictions.
Taking a longer-term view, the analysis found that an average summer in central Europe by 2100 would be more than 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than it was in the pre-industrial era. Scientists now say that all heat waves bear the fingerprints of human-induced climate change, caused primarily by burning fossil fuels.
“This data serves as an urgent reminder of the need for countries to go well beyond their nationally determined contributions so far pledged under the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to under 1.5°C if possible,” said the CCAG in the release.
Nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, lay out each countries’ planned emissions cuts in order to reach the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2C, or 1.5C if possible.
The UK set an all-time national temperature record in July after it exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time. Other local records were broken in parts of Spain, Portugal and France, which have also been battling wildfires as both heat and drought leave forests and grasslands tinderbox dry.
“In the aftermath of the 2003 European heatwave, which is estimated to have killed over 70,000 people, I predicted that such temperatures, so exceptional at the time, would become the norm under continued emissions. That prediction has now been realized,” said Peter Stott from the Met Office Hadley Centre. “The risks of extreme weather, including fires, drought and flash floods, will keep increasing rapidly unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced substantially.”
Paris Agreement pledges fall short
The new findings were published just over two months ahead of the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt. Countries last year agreed to align their emissions plans with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of COP27.
An analysis by the Climate Action Tracker last year found that none of the world’s major economies – including the entire G20 – had a plan that met their obligations under the Paris Agreement. Some countries have put forward more ambitious plans since then.
To contain global warming, the CCAG is arguing for countries to reduce emissions “urgently, deeply and rapidly”; to remove carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere in “vast quantities to reduce the total from today”; and to “buy time” to complete those two.
To do that, the committee said the world should repair broken parts of the climate system, starting with the Artic.
It added that “to create a manageable future we must refreeze the Arctic Ocean which has already warmed to 3.5C above the pre-industrial levels and is exacerbating the extreme weather events around the world.”
CCAG Chair David King said in a statement that the science was clear that extreme weather is “at least in large part a consequence of human-induced climate change.”
“The data released by the Met Office today shows that, even if countries meet their commitments to reduce emissions they have made so far, the situation is still set to get worse, with weather in Europe predicted to become even more extreme than seen this summer,” he said.
“This data doesn’t fully account for the instability of the Arctic, which we now know is a global tipping point which that could have major cascading consequences for the entire planet.”"
Before and after: These glaciers lost an area the size of Manhattan every 10 years since 1931,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/world/switzerland-glacier-loss-climate-change/index.html,"Before and after: These glaciers lost an area the size of Manhattan every 10 years since 1931
The climate crisis is devastating the world’s glaciers. As they melt, ecosystems are destroyed and local industries are ravaged — and perhaps most critically, a major source of fresh water vanishes.
For the first time, researchers have used historical imagery to reconstruct a visual timeline of Switzerland’s glaciers, which they found lost half of their volume between 1931 and 2016. In the past six year’s alone, they lost another 12% of their volume.
And in the 85 years ending in 2016, Switzerland’s glaciers lost an area the size of Manhattan every ten years.
The before-and-after imagery is stunning.
The analysis, conducted by scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, resulted in a striking visual contrast between Switzerland’s glaciers today and what they looked like nearly a century ago.
Given the record-high temperatures that enveloped vast swaths of the Northern Hemisphere this summer, Daniel Farinotti, a glaciologist and co-author of the study, told CNN that he expects this year’s glacier loss will be the worst.
“The year 2022 is extreme — not only have we had a very snow-poor winter, we also had an extremely warm summer, and this combination is truly the worst case,” Farinotti said. “We expect this year’s losses to be larger than the ones experienced in 2003, which so far was the ‘record year,’ in the negative sense, for glacier mass loss.”
Glacier loss causes ecoystem loss across plants and animals. It also affects the landscape’s appearance and impacts local tourism. And, importantly, glaciers are a critical source of fresh water for drinking and agriculture that disappears as the ice recedes.
“If glaciers were to disappear entirely, various regions might face issues related to water supplies — especially during summers such as we have had and are still having this year,” said Farinotti.
Farinotti said researchers expect to see another 60% loss in glacier mass by the end of the century — even if the world meets the climate targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.
“If climate change were to continue unabated, we might well find ourselves with European Alps that are virtually ice-free,” Farinotti warned."
Lakes are drying up everywhere. Israel will pump water from the Med as a solution,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/middleeast/israel-water-desalination-climate-cmd-intl/index.html,"Lakes are drying up everywhere. Israel will pump water from the Med as a solution
Despite its name, the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel is actually a freshwater lake, and it’s one that has sustained life for millennia. Even today, the lake irrigates vineyards and local farms that grow everything from green vegetables to wheat and tangerines. Its archeology, hot springs and hiking trails bring tourism and livelihoods for local communities.
But this place of religious pilgrimage — where the New Testament says many of Jesus’ miracles were performed — is facing a bleak future. The climate crisis is causing huge fluctuations in the lake’s water levels. Now it happens to be fairly full, but just five years ago, it hit a record low.
Climate change and unsustainable water management are leaving lakes dried up all over the Middle East and beyond, but the Israeli government is hopeful it has a solution: It plans to pump water from the Mediterranean sea, take the salt out of it and send it across the country to top up the lake when needed.
It’s a dramatic change for the Sea of Galilee, called the Kinneret in Hebrew, which once pumped out nearly all of Israel’s drinkable water. The water will now flow in the opposition direction.
Israel has plenty of expertise in desalination. As a water-insecure nation, it has for more than two decades been taking seawater from the Mediterranean and treating it through a process called reverse osmosis, essentially taking the salt out of the water to make it drinkable. It’s a process that other parts of the world, including California, have turned to in times of drought, but in Israel, it’s an everyday reality. Five desalination plants along the coast now provide nearly all the tap water for the country’s 9.2 million people.
One problem is that these plants tend to run on natural gas, a fossil fuel that contributes to the climate crisis, which only worsens the extreme weather that is causing the lake’s water levels to fluctuate in the first place. But in time, as grids transition to greener energy sources, Israel’s solution may become more attractive.
The new project looks a little underwhelming — a 1.6-meter-wide water pipe laid across 31 kilometers — but it’s the first of its kind. It will take the desalinated water and pump it through the Tsalmon stream that feeds the lake.
When he first heard of the project, Noam Ben Shoa, head engineer at Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, thought it was a strange idea.
“But very soon, we understood the value it has to the national market itself,” he told CNN at a construction site for the pipe.
It also helps with the development of agriculture in the wider region, he said, as well as relations with neighboring Jordan.
Israel has a long standing agreement with Jordan to sell tens of millions of cubic meters of water annually to the kingdom. In 2021, the two countries signed a new agreement where Jordan would receive 200 million cubic meters of desalinated water a year from Israel — about 20% of Jordan’s water needs — in return for solar energy to help power Israel’s electric grid. Emirati companies would build 600 solar power plants in Jordan to generate the energy.
Within months, the new $264 million pipeline is expected to be functional, and will be able to move 120 million square meters of water per year, but will only pump to the lake when necessary, Ben Shoa said.
“The uniqueness of this project is that it gives us almost infinite flexibility,” he said. “We can basically take the water where it is available … and just divert it and transport it to wherever it is needed. In the population centers, for agricultural or industrial uses as well.”
Getting ahead of the crisis
The need to do things radically differently hit home during the most recent, five-year drought, which ended in 2018. Despite a ban on pumping water from the lake, water levels here still reached a record low. But it’s also what’s to come with the worsening climate crisis that has pushed Israel’s water authority to intervene now.
“They looked into the future climate change, and what’s going to happen [with] rainfall in this area, and also looked at the increase in population and projected increase in demand of water,” Gideon Gal, senior scientist and head of the Kinneret Limnological Laboratory, told CNN. “And they realized that 30, 40 years from now, there’s going to be a serious problem in maintaining [water] levels in the lake, and maintaining water quality unless something is done.”
But that something had never been done before. Even if salt is removed, the makeup of the water is also different in other ways, Gal said.
“When you mix desalinated water with natural water, you see an impact on the biology in the experiments,” Gal said. “We’ll be bringing things to the lake that may not exist naturally.”
But so far, Gal says their experiments show the new water won’t cause a huge impact on existing species. In fact, it may even help the lake combat the effects of climate change by causing a higher rate of water turnover, which helps prevent too much bacterial growth, and could help cool the water’s temperatures.
Even with the potential benefits, Gal said he wished the lake didn’t need any human intervention.
“But given what we think we know about climate change, and what’s going to happen in the lake,” Gal said. “The risk of introducing desalinated water is a risk that is worthwhile taking.”"

London got so warm this summer that newspapers splashed with headlines saying temperatures in the city had exceeded those of scorching hot Dubai.
One after another, European countries such as Spain and Portugal registered record highs this year.
The northern hemisphere did indeed witness record temperatures, with wildfires engulfing parts of Europe and drought threatening food supplies. And, often, European cities witnessed hotter conditions than those in the Persian Gulf.
But experts say that temperature alone isn’t an adequate measure of the livability of a city – a combination of heat and humidity is. And that’s why the Middle East is far less livable than Europe even at the same temperatures.
The Middle East is still quite hot. The Iranian city of Abadan set the record for the hottest dry heat temperature this year when it hit 53 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 5. But combine that with the high levels of humidity in the region and it becomes an even more inhospitable place for human beings. It’s harder to cool down when the weather is humid, as our bodies struggle to transfer their heat to “wet” air rather than dry air, making it harder to sweat it out and lower our body temperatures.
The measure of heat combined with humidity is called the wet bulb temperature. The name stems from the way this condition is measured, literally by wrapping a wet cloth around a thermometer and measuring the temperature as the water evaporates.
This speaks directly to our body’s ability to cool itself through sweating.
“The wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporative cooling,” Tapio Schneider, a professor of environmental science and engineering at the California Institute of Technology, told CNN.
The Middle East is especially vulnerable to rising global temperatures. “The region is already warm and can be humid,” he said. “Therefore, global warming can push it into the zone where human health is endangered.”
On July 19, the UK experienced its hottest day on record, surpassing temperatures of 40C for the first time, with a high of 40.3C in eastern England. On the same day, average temperatures in both London and Dubai were 34C – but the wet bulb temperature in London was 20C, while Dubai was a more painful 27C.
The Persian Gulf is one of the few places in the world ever to record a wet bulb temperature that exceeds the threshold of human survivability, 35C. Since 2005, there have been nine separate occasions of this on record.
A wet bulb temperature of 35C means the body can no longer cool itself to a temperature that can maintain normal functions.
“It is a hard threshold for survivability in that independent of age and fitness, humans cannot survive in those conditions; they will die within hours without special exertion,” said Schneider.
Wet bulb temperatures just under 35C aren’t ideal either. “Humans experience heat stress at lower wet bulb temperatures too,” he said. “And the degree to which they can survive such heat stress does depend on fitness, age, and pre-existing conditions.”
The oil-rich Arab states of the Persian Gulf have equipped themselves against the heat, with energy-intensive air conditioning, but other regional countries haven’t been as privileged.
In Iraq, employees in the city of Basra were asked to stay home due to high temperatures earlier this month. However, households only get up to 10 hours of electricity from the national grid, with those who can afford it paying private generator providers to cover the other hours.
In Gaza, residents cool off in the three to four hours of electricity they get per day, suffering for periods of up to 20 hours with no electricity daily. Similarly, Lebanon’s government no longer provides more than two hours of electricity per day.
And even in some Gulf Arab states, such as Kuwait, where there is a building boom, access to air conditioning isn’t available to all, including construction workers toiling outdoors.
Research by Purdue University found that at around a wet bulb temperature of 32C, it becomes impossible even for healthy people to work outdoors, with physical labor having a limit of 31C.
An MIT simulation found that if the current pace of greenhouse emissions remains constant in the Persian Gulf, annual maximum wet bulb temperatures in cities such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha would exceed the threshold for human survivability (35C) several times a year by the end of the century.

What to watch
Climate change and poor water management are causing alarming droughts across the globe, drying up lakes that once flowed with abundant fresh water. Israel is hopeful, however, that by desalinating sea water from the Mediterranean, it can pump back fresh water into lakes across the country.

The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art was forced to temporarily close due to insect infestation, the museum said in a statement and apology on Wednesday.
The news broke after a video posted on the BBC Persian website went viral. It showed two silverfish crawling under the glass of a famous photograph taken by influential German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher.
“The treasure works of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Arts, national wealth and their proper maintenance are the most important concern of all of us, and the attention and sensitivity of the Iranian art family is a valuable asset,” the statement said.
Once the museum became aware of the situation, pest control technicians rushed over to tackle the problem, it said. “Fortunately, this work was not damaged, and no insects were seen in the other works of the exhibition,” it continued.
The statement said that experts will be fumigating the building’s exterior spaces, as it is likely the insects entered from outside.
The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is one of the largest art museums in the country, carrying large collections of both Iranian and Western paintings. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, many of the renowned Western art pieces were stored and hidden in the museum vault for decades. Now, the museum frequently displays artwork from around the world, including the United States and Europe.

As its supply dwindles, a crisis looms
The drought’s expansion has hit farming communities in the Northeast particularly hard, and experts tell CNN that the region is unprepared to manage new challenges amid dry conditions.
What’s happening there is a prime example of the climate crisis intensifying the water cycle, making wet periods wetter and dry periods drier, according to Aaron Bernstein, the interim director at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment.
“We know already that New England has seen the greatest increase in heavy downpours, so we expect that climate change is driving an intensification of water cycles — both more intense floods and intense droughts,” Bernstein told CNN. “We’ve certainly seen the heavier downpour piece of the equation, and we tend to think that places that are already dry are going to be the places where the droughts get worse, but we don’t have a perfect crystal ball on climate science.”
Low rainfall, shrinking rivers and depleting reservoirs have left farmers struggling to grow food crops, which is greatly affecting their income.
“If you’re growing anything, you know that plants are needing a lot more water now, and because we don’t often deal with severe drought in the Northeast, it becomes unpredictable and harder to manage,” Jennifer Marlon, climate scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, told CNN. “Now we are reminded again that the weather is becoming harder to manage and throwing new wrenches into our daily lives.”
Bernstein said the situation is also putting a strain on farmers’ mental health.
“There is an ample amount of scientific research showing that droughts can affect the mental health of everybody, but particularly people who are farmers,” Bernstein told CNN. “That’s not surprising when their lives and livelihoods are literally drying up before their eyes.”
Marlon and Bernstein say that because the Northeast has faced the impacts of the climate crisis in the form of heavy precipitation, storm surges, flooding and rising sea levels, severe drought is an extreme event the region is not prepared for.
“The West arguably has spent a lot more time thinking about how to deal with drought … and people drastically reduced their water use because everyone knew that droughts were a major problem,” Bernstein said. “When it comes to New England, one of the big differences to me is that we don’t know drought and our water systems are not designed to be as water efficient. I’m not sure we would do that well in New England.”
The dry conditions are also fueling the Briarwood Fire around 40 miles north of Boston in Rockport, Massachusetts. Gov. Charlie Baker has activated the National Guard to help support firefighters on that blaze, his office said in a statement. The fire has been burning for one month across 19 acres and “continues to smolder above and below ground,” the statement says.
From flash drought to flash flood
In the South, drought is worsening in Texas, where rainfall has been well below average. But another concern is building in the Lone Star State starting this weekend, as extreme rain is forecast to fall on top of extreme drought — a combination that could lead to dangerous flash flooding.
A flash drought has been building across the Southern Plains since mid-July, and Texas has the most exceptional drought area in the country, primarily concentrated in the middle of the state, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the US Drought Monitor reported Thursday.
Broad areas of exceptional drought — level 4 out of 4 — covers 25% of the state from the southern Texas Panhandle southeast toward the Gulf Coast.
“Over the last half-year, rainfall deficits of 8 inches to locally over a foot have affected areas of central Texas near and south of Dallas/Ft. Worth to the Gulf Coast,” the Drought Monitor wrote. “The next five days could see heavy rainfall and improvement across a large part of northern Texas and southern Oklahoma eastward along the Arkansas/Louisiana border.”
Nearly three quarters of US farmers, and many in Texas, say this year’s drought is hurting their harvest and forcing them to fallow fields and sell off cattle early, CNN has reported.
But extreme rain is in the forecast, which could lead to new problems. From Sunday into the middle of next week, tropical moisture will feed into the region, leading to several rounds of organized showers and thunderstorms repeating over the same portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.
“This will be beneficial rains, much-needed rainfall given the ongoing drought, but the concern is as we get into early next week, is that sometimes you know it can be too much too soon,” Zach Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, told CNN. “And that could lead to some incidents of flash flooding.”
When heavy rain falls over drought-stricken soil — which is often hard and cracked — it cannot soak into the ground. Instead, it quickly runs off into creeks and rivers which rise rapidly, increasing the risk for flash flooding.
“Anytime you get some intense rainfall rates in a short period of time, that could lead to flash flooding,” Taylor said. He said the rain rates could be overwhelming given the dry soil conditions.
The Weather Prediction Center has issued a slight risk — level 2 of 4 — for excessive rainfall on Sunday and Monday of next week.
“The axis of heaviest rainfall right now is centered mainly across northern Texas, impacting areas around Dallas,” Taylor said.
The forecast calls for widespread 3 to 5 inches of rainfall across the region. However, some forecast computer models are showing even higher amounts.
“The European (computer forecast model) the last couple of days, has shown on some of the higher end amounts, but we’re not, at least at this point, not expecting anything just like that,” Taylor said.
Monsoon eases Southwest drought
In the Southwest, recent “ample rains from the North American monsoon,” have helped to ease some of the worst drought conditions. Arizona has seen the most dramatic improvement in drought conditions of late — only 3% of the state was in extreme drought this week, down from 25% one month ago and the lowest it has been in exactly two years.
The Tier 2 water shortage announced this week on the Colorado River means Arizona is facing more drastic cuts in water usage beginning in January. But while the current rainfall is easing some of the short-term drought impacts, 90% of the Colorado River basin is still in drought, and years of deficient rain and snow have set up the current water shortage."

Extreme heat is slamming the world’s three biggest economies all at once
Estimating just how catastrophic climate change will be for the global economy has historically proven challenging. But this summer, it’s increasingly evident how quickly costs can pile up.
Extreme heat and drought conditions are battering the United States, Europe and China, compounding problems for workers and businesses at a time when economic growth is already slowing sharply and adding to upward pressure on prices.
In China’s Sichuan province, all factories have been ordered shut for six days to conserve power. Ships carrying coal and chemicals are struggling to make their usual trips along Germany’s Rhine river. And people living on America’s West Coast have been asked to use less electricity as temperatures soar.
These events “have the capacity to be quite significant for the particular regions that are affected,” said Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics.
The extent of the pain could depend on how long the heatwaves and lack of rain last. But in countries like Germany, experts warn there’s little relief in sight, and companies are preparing for the worst.
Extreme weather and an economic slowdown
It’s not just the Rhine. Around the world, rivers that support global growth — the Yangtze, the Danube and the Colorado — are drying up, impeding the movement of goods, messing with irrigation systems and making it harder for power plants and factories to stay cool.
At the same time, scorching heat is hampering transportation networks, straining power supply and hurting worker productivity.
“We shouldn’t be surprised by the heat wave events,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. “They’re exactly what we predicted and are part of a trend: more frequent, more intense, all over the world.”
China is facing its fiercest heat wave in six decades, with temperatures crossing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in dozens of cities. Parts of California could see temperatures as high as 109 degrees Fahrenheit this week. Earlier this summer, temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius in the United Kingdom for the first time ever.
The global economy was already under pressure. Europe is at high risk of a recession as energy prices soar, stoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. High inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve jeopardize growth in the United States. China is grappling with the consequences of harsh coronavirus lockdowns and a real estate crisis.
“At present, we are at the most difficult point of economic stabilization,” Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week.
Something else to worry about
Extreme weather could exacerbate “existing pinch points” along supply chains, a major reason inflation has been difficult to bring down, May of Oxford Economics said.
China’s Sichuan province, where factories have shuttered production this week, is a hub for makers of semiconductors and solar panels. The power rationing will hit factories belonging to some of the world’s biggest electronics companies, including Apple
            
                (AAPL) supplier Foxconn and Intel
            
                (INTC).
The province is also the epicenter of China’s lithium mining industry. The shutdown may push up the cost of the raw material, which is a key component in electric car batteries.
The neighboring city of Chongqing, which sits at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, has also ordered factories to suspend operations for a week through next Wednesday to conserve electricity, state media The Paper reported.
Forecasts for China’s economy this year are already being downgraded as a consequence. Analysts at Nomura cut their 2022 projection for GDP growth to 2.8% on Thursday — way below the government’s 5.5% target — while Goldman Sachs trimmed its forecast to 3%.
Germany’s shrinking Rhine, meanwhile, has dropped below a critical level, impeding the flow of vessels. The river is a crucial conduit for chemicals and grain as well as commodities — including coal, which is in higher demand as the country races to fill storage facilities with natural gas ahead of the winter. Finding alternative forms of transit is difficult given labor shortages.
“It is only a matter of time before plants in the chemical or steel industry are shut down, mineral oils and building materials fail to reach their destination, or large-volume and heavy transports can no longer be carried out,” Holger Lösch, deputy director of the Federation of German Industries, said in a statement this week.
Low water levels along the Rhine shaved about 0.3 percentage points off Germany’s economic output in 2018, according to Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. But in that instance, low water wasn’t a problem until late September. This time around, it could lower GDP by at least 0.5 percentage points in the second half of this year, he estimated.
Economic sentiment in Germany continued to dip in August, according to data released this week. Brzeski said the country “would need an economic miracle” to avoid falling into a recession in the coming months.
In the American West, an extraordinary drought is draining the nation’s largest reservoirs, forcing the federal government to implement new mandatory water cuts. It’s also forcing farmers to destroy crops.
Nearly three quarters of US farmers say this year’s drought is hurting their harvest — with significant crop and income loss, according to a survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation, an insurance company and lobbying group that represents agricultural interests.
The survey was conducted across 15 states from June 8 to July 20 in extreme drought regions from Texas to North Dakota to California, which makes up nearly half of the country’s agricultural production value. In California — a state with high fruit and nut tree crops — 50% of farmers said they had to remove trees and multiyear crops due to drought, which will affect future revenue.
Without significant investment in upgrading infrastructure, costs will only keep rising, Ward of the London School of Economics noted. And the impact may not be incremental.
“There are signs these heat episodes are not just becoming slightly more intense and frequent over time. It’s happening in a kind of non-gradual way, and that will make it more difficult to adapt,” Ward said.

Where water is called ‘blue gold’: A town grapples with one of its worst droughts on record,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/europe/france-drought-climate-cmd-intl/index.html,"Where water is called ‘blue gold’: A town grapples with one of its worst droughts on record
For well over a century, water has gurgled through a web of gutters and channels on Cécile Messelis’ farm, flowing into an underground reservoir and earthen troughs to nourish crops sown across terraced fields.
In 2020, that stream began to falter. This year, it stopped altogether: Messelis’ fields now crackle in the sunlight; her stone cistern echoes with thirst.
On this small farm in the upper reaches of Seillans, a commune in the Var region of southern France, the fields are bare but for the parched remnants of the last harvest. Normally, aubergines, tomatoes, peppers and melons thrive here. Now, the fields lie fallow.
Messelis’ reservoirs first ran empty after last winter was remarkably dry. She then had to rely on tap water to grow the organic fruit and vegetables that make up the baskets she sells to neighbors and at local markets.
Then in May, local authorities tightened the taps as well.
France is suffering what authorities say is likely its worst drought on record. It’s a similar picture across much of Europe — more than 60% of land in the European Union is under drought warnings or more severe alerts, according to the European Drought Observatory.
The rain has been so scant that major rivers are drying up in parts. The Loire and Rhone in France, the Po in Italy and the Rhine in Germany have all experienced particularly low water levels, some of them have even shrunk, impacting transport, agriculture and energy production.
Now downpours are hitting several parts of the country. In the Loire region of central France, they’ve triggered flooding. The soil is so parched, like a dry sponge, it simply can’t absorb that much rain. In Paris, floods that hit Tuesday evening forced 10 underground Metro stations to close. The stormy weather has brought relief from the heat, but little to break the drought. What’s needed is less intense and more consistent rain over much longer periods of time.
In January, when worries about the dry winter emerged, Seillans’ authorities proposed to sell Messelis emergency water supplies that had been trucked in at €20 ($20.40) per cubic meter (around 264 gallons), she said. Private suppliers were offering only slightly cheaper rates. Normally, she would pay just around 50 cents ($0.51) for the same amount from the tap.
It was an impossible option for her.
“It’s not worth starting,” the 54-year-old farmer told CNN. “It’s almost like we’re working just to pay for the water.”
Unlike generations past, Messelis’ neighbors today are more likely to have a swimming pool than a vegetable plot, a somewhat cruel irony for her this summer: In the first period of water restrictions, residents were still allowed to top up their pools, while her crops withered.
“It was a moment of shock,” she said. “It’s so obvious that the priority [should be] to eat.”
Dark clouds
In May, the people of Seillans were put under water rationing, given a 150 liters a day per person in the worst-hit part of the commune. It wasn’t long until the rest of Seillans were given daily limits too, although of a higher 200 liters.
It should be enough to cover basic needs — the average French person consumes 149 liters daily. But going unchecked, it’s easy to use hundreds of liters more. Just running a tap while brushing teeth or between rinsing dishes wastes six liters of water every minute.
Seillans was one of the first communities in France to run out of sufficient water for residents this year, but by early August, some 100 communes were in the same position, according to French Ecological Transition Minister Christophe Béchu.
Many parts of the Var region have seen around 80% less rain than the long-term average between the start of July and August 10, according to the drought mission for the regional land and sea directorate. Some areas haven’t seen any measurable rain at all.
The region is now “in a crisis,” the mission’s chief, Julien Assante, told CNN.
Droughts in the Mediterranean region, where Seillans sits, have increased in frequency already because of the human-driven climate crisis, and the heat waves that can exacerbate them are also more common and more intense, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The more the Earth warms, the more the region will experience aridity, droughts and fire weather conditions.
And drought isn’t just impacting farmers and households. With it has come intense wildfires. More than 780,000 hectares (more than 3,000 square miles) across Europe have burned so far this year, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. So exhausted are France’s firefighting resources that colleagues from Romania, Italy, Poland and Austria, as well as aircraft from Greece and Sweden, have been called in to battle the blazes.
New rituals
In the Ricou household, the drought has sparked a new ritual. Every few days, Brigitte Ricou climbs to the back of her shrubbery to photograph her water meter. It’s the best way to monitor how much she, her husband and her visiting grandson are using.
“We look at our meter a lot,” she told CNN from her kitchen in lower Seillans, where there is a 200-liter daily limit per resident. She said it was difficult to estimate how much water each person uses every day, and that it was something that required practice and thought.
She and her husband have implemented a range of measures to limit their water use, from washing food in bowls and using that same water for their plants. They use bottled water for drinking, take shorter showers and they don’t flush the toilet after every use.
“Sometimes I lower my consumption drastically to make my 200 liters,” she said, adding that she doesn’t view the quota as a right, as some people do, but as a maximum allowance. “This water, it’s precious.”
To Seillans Mayor René Ugo, water is more like a “sacred” resource. A small stream that used to run through the town all year round was once the lifeblood of a variety of businesses lower Seillans, from a perfume shop to an oil press, he said. But as it dried up, so too did business. This year, it hasn’t flowed at all.
“It was a warning,” Ugo said, referring to his observations of dry conditions back in January. “I was afraid of what could happen and those fears came to pass.”
And in Seillans, the stopgap measures go well beyond rationing — the town is now trucking freshwater in. The local town hall oversaw the purchase of a water tanker, which now makes eight trundling return trips to restock the worst-hit districts’ water reservoirs. Filling up from a fire hydrant fed by an underground source — the water naturally filtered by the rock — the truck deposits 8,000 liters at a time.
While the mayor recognizes it’s a short-term solution, it’s also an investment for the future. There are no plans to sell the truck at the end of the dry season, he says, in an implicit acknowledgment that the village could face such shortages again.
It’s also a cost that local residents will have to shoulder, with higher water bills, the mayor said, another pain point as the cost of living crisis bites.
For local police officer Philippe Grenêche, extreme drought has become the new normal, and even part of his beat.
He and his colleague now patrol the village looking for evidence of water-releated offences: Green lawns, for example, are a sure sign of sprinkler use, which is banned; swimming pools that appear to have been refilled are another sign of violations.
People are sometimes even caught stealing water from fire hydrants.
“We had black gold,” Grenêche told CNN, referring to the value of petroleum, as his patrol car wound through the hills of Seillans. “And now with all this, we’ve got ‘blue gold.’”

"An ‘extreme heat belt’ will impact over 100 million Americans in the next 30 years, study finds",https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/weather/extreme-heat-belt-us-impact-study-climate/index.html,"An ‘extreme heat belt’ will impact over 100 million Americans in the next 30 years, study finds
Worsening heat and humidity as a result of climate change will bring extremely dangerous heat indices to much of the United States in the next 30 years, increasing both the intensity and frequency of the hottest days of the year, according to a new study published Monday.
Temperatures above the threshold of the National Weather Service’s “extreme danger” category, when the heat index is more than 125 degrees Fahrenheit, is expected to affect about 8 million people in the US this year. But by 2053, 13 times that many people – 107 million – will experience that extremely dangerous heat, according to the study by the climate research group First Street Foundation.
“The results indicate that the incidence of extreme heat is growing across the country, both in absolute and relative terms,” the study states.
Temperatures in some areas will increase more than in others, including a so-called “extreme heat belt,” stretching from Texas all the way to the Great Lakes, the nonprofit’s study found.
More than 100 million Americans in this region will experience temperatures above 125 degrees (52 degrees Celsius) during their hottest stretches of the year, more than 10 times the number expected currently.
Using a peer-reviewed extreme heat model, First Street Foundation used property-level data to find the hottest seven days of the year currently and compared that to the equivalent in 30 years. On average, the seven hottest days will increase to 18 by 2053, the researchers found.
But in the southern half of the country, the number of hottest days will grow to around 30 – meaning what was once the hottest week of the year will become the hottest month by the 2050s, according to the study.
Florida’s Miami-Dade County will see the largest shift in extreme temperatures, where the hottest seven days of the year in 2023 (heat index of 103 degrees) will occur on 34 days in 2053. Other locations in Florida and along the Gulf Coast are likely to experience more than 30 additional days of heat indices above 100 degrees by 2053, the study found.
Nationwide, the number of counties expected to reach a heat index of 125 degrees at least once a year will jump more than 20-fold from 50 in 2023 to 1,023 in 2053, according to the study.
The probability of local heat waves – defined as temperatures well-above normal for three consecutive days – will also increase across the country, but is highest along the West Coast, according to the study.
“Interestingly, exposure to Consecutive Local Hot Days is most likely to occur in West Coast states, while states in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast are most at risk of exposure to extremely dangerous temperatures, meaning virtually the entire country is subject to increasing perils associated with heat exposure,” the study finds.
The study also determined a projection of change for each of the US states."
Parts of England officially fall into drought after months of scant rainfall,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/uk/uk-drought-climate-gbr-intl/index.html,"Parts of England officially fall into drought after months of scant rainfall
Large swaths of England have officially descended into drought, authorities announced Friday, urging residents and businesses in affected areas to conserve water in the driest summer in 50 years.
The Environment Agency announced that England’s south, southwest and southeast are in drought, along with central and eastern regions, after convening the National Drought Group, made up of water companies, ministers and other water authorities. Parts of the capital, London, are also affected.
The UK has had five consecutive months of below-average rainfall and back-to-back heat waves, with temperatures expected to peak on Saturday as high as 37 Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts. Only two months since the start of 2021 have seen at least average rainfall.
Southern England received just 17% of its average rainfall in July, according to the UK Met office.
“We are currently experiencing a second heatwave after what was the driest July on record for parts of the country. Action is already being taken by the Government and other partners including the Environment Agency to manage the impacts,” the country’s Water Minister Steve Double said in a statement. “All water companies have reassured us that essential supplies are still safe, and we have made it clear it is their duty to maintain those supplies.”
While the lack of rain and heat are driving this drought, around 3.1 billion liters of water are lost every day in England and Wales through leaks in the nations’ aging infrastructure. Consumer groups and experts have called on water companies to do more to plug leaks.
The Environment Agency said in its statement that the government expected water companies “to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.”
Several rivers across England have been drying up in parts, including the Thames, which runs through London. Officials have been reoxygenating rivers and rescuing fish where levels are low. Water levels in reservoirs are also rapidly dropping.
The drought declaration means water companies and governments should implement drought plans without seeking permission from ministers. Companies are likely to impose more hosepipe bans, which are already in place for millions of people, forcing them to water gardens and wash cars without hoses, and refrain from filling up paddling pools in the ongoing heat wave. Companies could also take more water out of rivers and other sources to ensure supplies.
The announcement Friday puts the declared area under an amber drought alert, meaning several indicators – including rainfall, river levels and flows, reservoir storage and groundwater levels – are very low.
Thirteen rivers that the Environment Agency monitors as indicators of wider conditions are at their lowest levels ever recorded, while soil moisture is comparable to the end of the 1975-76 drought, one of the country’s most severe. That drought was also triggered by a combination of extreme heat and consecutive months of low rainfall.
The amber alert is one tier below the more severe red alert and means that there is likely to be stress on water supply sources, reduced agricultural and crop yields, localized wildfires and impacts on wildlife and their habitats, according to a previous report by the Environment Agency.
The London Fire Brigade has also warned of “tinderbox dry” conditions this week and an “exceptional fire risk” across the capital as temperatures are expected to reach 36 Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday and as grass – from lawns to public parks and heaths – is bone dry and brown without the usual rainfall. Parts of the capital, including homes and parks, were hit by fires on July 19 during a record-breaking heat wave.
Concerns grow over food security
The UK does typically experience drought conditions every five to 10 years in some areas. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology has said that drought conditions could continue until at least October. The agency only looks a few months ahead, and climate scientists have warned that if this coming winter is also dry, like last winter, the UK’s food security could be at risk.
Liz Bentley, CEO of the Royal Meteorological Society, said that there were already concerns about the impact of drought on food supplies and affordability.
“There’s a number of crops that are really struggling due to either lack of rainfall, like the potato crop here relies on rainfall, they don’t usually take water from anywhere else to irrigate the fields. And even some of the other crops that do take water from from rivers, for example, to irrigate fields, they’re really struggling at the moment,” Bentley told CNN.
“Even in current conditions, yields are going to be down for a number of crops and the price of these things are going to go up, and obviously that’s due to drought here in the UK. But there’s other things going on across Europe.”
Around 63% of the land across the European Union and UK is under drought warnings or alerts issued by the European Drought Monitor, meaning there is inadequate moisture in the soil. That’s an area almost the size of India, or the three biggest US states – Alaska, Texas and California – combined. On 17% of land, drought conditions are more severe, meaning vegetation is stressed.
Experts are warning that drought could continue into the autumn, or even winter, which is when the nation typically gets most of its rain to store for drier parts of the year. Another dry winter would put even more stress on food security.
“It’s going to continue into the autumn and then really, we don’t know beyond that. It depends on whether we see any significant rainfall – good steady rainfall that replenishes water levels,” Bentley said. “What we don’t want at the moment are heavy, thundery downpours, because the ground is so dry that water just runs off. It doesn’t soak into the ground.”"
"The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, new research shows",https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/us/arctic-rapid-warming-climate/index.html,"The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, new research shows
As sea ice vanishes, Greenland melts and wildfires scorch the planet’s northernmost forests, new research confirms what scientists are sounding alarms about: the Arctic has warmed much faster than the rest of the world in the past several decades.
The phenomenon, called Arctic amplification, is caused by the heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels. The pace of the temperature increase around the North Pole in recent decades was four times higher than the rest of the planet, researchers at the Finnish Meteorological Institute found in a study published Thursday.
Another problem: Climate models, which scientists used to predict long-term change, are not capturing this high rate of warming, lead author and researcher Mika Rantanen told CNN, which was part of this study’s motivation. That’s concerning because if the models can’t recreate what’s happening right now, scientists can’t be confident in their long-term predictions.
“Because of this discrepancy, we decided that this needs to be corrected,” Rantenen said. “This needs to be updated.”
The study, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, analyzed temperature trends in the Arctic Circle between 1979 and 2021 — the modern era of satellite data. They found the rate of warming is particularly high in the Eurasian region of the Arctic, especially the Barents Sea, which has warmed seven times faster than the global average.
Recent data revealed that the annual average temperature in the Barents region climbed by as much as 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade in the past 20 to 40 years, making the Barents Sea and its islands the fastest warming location on the planet.
Climate change has triggered a rapid loss in sea ice in the Arctic region, which in turn has amplified global warming. Bright white sea ice reflects solar energy back to space, but when it melts, the dark ocean absorbs that heat.
John Walsh, chief scientist at the International Arctic Research Center in the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said the study’s timeframe really homed in on the Arctic amplification phenomenon, which has been more significant in the past several decades than the early and mid-1900s.
“The Arctic amplification is unmistakable,” Walsh, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “It’s more than a factor of one; it’s a factor of several — whether it’s two or three or four — and I think that doesn’t change the fact that the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world.”
Last year’s annual Arctic Report Card, which was published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the Arctic region is warming faster than the rest of the Earth and is rapidly losing ice cover, transforming the typically frozen landscape to a greener and browner one than it was just roughly a decade ago.
All these findings also reflect the most recent UN state-of-the-science report on the climate crisis, which found the Arctic will continue to warm faster than the rest of the planet as long as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
“The Arctic is really more sensitive to global warming than previously thought,” Rantanen said. “Only time will tell. Let’s see how this will evolve in the future.”"
There’s $4B for West drought relief in the climate bill. Here’s how it could be used,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/drought-relief-funds-climate-bill/index.html,"There’s $4B for West drought relief in the climate bill. Here’s how it could be used
Democrats’ unprecedented climate bill would throw $4 billion to states in the West for drought relief, thanks to last-minute negotiations in the Senate. Southwest lawmakers struck the deal in the 11th hour with hopes that it could buy the fragile Colorado River Basin more time amid its most intense drought in centuries.
Some states, tribes and cities are already reducing their water usage. Farmers are fallowing fields and changing how they irrigate as the water runs dry.
If the House passes the climate bill, it would answer the question that has been worrying Southwest lawmakers: How are we going to compensate farmers and residents for even steeper, voluntary water cuts?
With this funding, states could pay farmers not to farm and pay residents to dig up their lawns in favor of xeriscaping. The $4 billion could be doled out to ranchers, farmers, private communities, Native American tribes or businesses that voluntarily reduce their water usage or work to restore the habitat and ecology of the rivers.
Lawmakers told CNN the funding is long overdue. And it comes just as the US Bureau of Reclamation is set to cut Colorado River water allocations for the second year in a row. Federal officials have already taken unprecedented steps to try and save Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two largest reservoirs in the country, which millions of people rely on for agriculture, hydropower and municipal water use.
But those steps still may not be enough to salvage the reservoirs and the river basin that feeds them, said Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat.
“This thing is getting worse so fast that those cuts don’t stabilize the system,” Kelly told CNN. “We have to find more water to leave in Lake Mead and Lake Powell, but where does that water come from?”
As regular rainfall decreases in the West – a consequence of the climate crisis – that water must come from usage cuts.
Sarah Porter, the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University, said one helpful proposal has been for Southwest farmers to cut nearly 1 million acre-feet of their water usage per year. One acre-foot – a foot of water spread out over an acre – is roughly 325,000 gallons of water, which is enough to sustain a family of four for an entire year.
This bill is a “gamechanger,” Porter told CNN, because it answers the question of how the government would pay those farmers to stop farming.
“This new provision, this money will fund voluntary conservation,” Porter said. “And that’s what we need to have happen.”
A red-line demand
Kelly and other Senate Democrats including Colorado’s Michael Bennet and Nevada’s Catherine Cortez Masto struck a hasty deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to include the funding in the final days before the bill’s passage.
They were aided by Arizona Democrat Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Senate swing vote who made drought relief funding a red-line demand in her own negotiations with Schumer.
The funding was not guaranteed – lawmakers said the amount swung from $1 billion up to a final $4 billion. Bennet told CNN that when they finalized $4 billion, “it made me want to break down and cry.”
The Bureau of Reclamation is looking to cut 2 to 4 million acre-feet of water usage to sustain Lakes Powell and Mead, starting next year, bureau commissioner Camille Touton said at a recent congressional hearing.
Bennet and Kelly said the drought is severe for farmers in their states, who are being forced to make tough choices for their crops and livestock. About 80% of Arizona’s Colorado River allocation goes toward watering crops, Kelly said.
“They understand that we’re trying to help, and they need to do their part as well,” Kelly said.
“Everyone knows that nobody’s making new water,” Bennet added. “We’re in a crisis and we’ve got to figure out how to do voluntary reductions and begin addressing this.”
Water cuts vs. improving infrastructure
Last year, the Bureau of Reclamation was allocated around $8 billion for needed projects and infrastructure upgrades from President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law. But the $4 billion in the climate bill is fundamentally different, according to Porter.
“The infrastructure funding typically funds projects that will result in efficient water use, and we’re at a point where we’ve identified or done a lot of those things,” Porter said. “There just aren’t many opportunities left; that’s why we’re at this point where we have to be looking at paying people to leave water in the system.”
Going forward, longer-term solutions like water reuse and recycling are desperately needed, said Eric Kuhn, a retired former manager of the Colorado River Water Conservation District.
“My only hope is the majority of the money is spent on projects that permanently reduce and put the system in the balance, rather than covering the costs of temporary fallowing,” Kuhn told CNN. “The system really needs to be more reactive to uncertain changes in hydrology due to climate change.”
Experts and lawmakers told CNN that their main priority now is to salvage and stabilize water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Without these reservoirs, the West’s water crisis would dramatically deepen.
“If we end up drying out Lake Powell and Lake Mead and get to the situation where it’s unrecoverable, I can’t imagine what the cost of that will be,” Bennet said. “I’m glad we have a down payment that will buy us some time.”"

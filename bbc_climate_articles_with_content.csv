UK government not taking climate seriously - advisers,"The government has made little progress in preparing the UK for rising temperatures, climate watchdog the CCC says.",30 Apr 2025,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpey03pnno,"The government has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power, its climate watchdog has warned.
In a highly critical report, the independent Climate Change Committee says progress is ""either too slow, has stalled, or is heading in the wrong direction"".
From hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies, this could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, the CCC warns.
In response, the government pointed to its investment in flood defences, but acknowledged more work was needed.
Floods Minister Emma Hardy told BBC News that preparing for the changing climate was ""something we're really committed to"".
""We are putting £2.65bn into upgrading, maintaining and building new flood defences.
""But we absolutely know, of course, there's more that needs to be done.""
Fuelled by climate change, the UK's weather extremes are intensifying, from the 40C heat of July 2022 to England's wettest 18 months on record between October 2022 to March 2024.
Such events are only likely to become more severe and happen more often, as the planet continues to get hotter due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases.
Better preparation can limit the damage by making the country more resilient, but the CCC says this is not happening at anywhere near the required pace.
""We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,"" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News.
""The manifesto said it was going to address this issue of resilience and yet, so far, it's done nothing,"" she added.
""We've heard some warm words… but nothing has come out yet.""
None of the 46 areas assessed were found to be making ""good"" progress in adapting to climate change. Only three had ""good"" plans and policies in place for the future.
These are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.
Health is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.
The CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.
Baroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.
This meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.
""We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,"" she said.
""We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.""
Flooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.
The ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point. It's been flooded repeatedly in the last four years, most recently in November 2024.
Polly Pearce described how her charity shop flooded.
""It was so quick...  [like] a tsunami,"" she said.
""[The water] came up as high as the panelling right up on the wall... we had all our Christmas stuff ready but lost it.""
The main street is studded with empty shops, many reportedly put out of business by the cost of repeated floods.
Shop owners say insurance companies either won't insure their properties or that the premiums are now so high many shop keepers say they simply can't afford it.
And the Environment Agency has said it can't afford the £25m-£30m cost of flood protection for the town.
The government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.
The CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions.
At the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.
But putting off efforts to prepare the UK for the changing climate in an attempt to save cash would be ""a huge mistake"" and could increase economic damage in the long run, Baroness Brown said.
""We are very worried about their spending review,"" she added, in an unusually strong plea from the Committee.
""This is not a tomorrow problem; it's a today problem. If we don't address it today, it becomes a disaster tomorrow.""
A freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).
That's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.
Defra said some of these employees also worked on climate adaptation part-time, and the figures don't include those working in other parts of government.

Climate experts criticise handling of Tata changes,"Ministers should have been better at planning and making sure green jobs were available, report says.",9 hrs ago,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79ezrvd9neo,"The UK's climate change advisors have criticised the handling of a switch to greener steelmaking at the country's largest plant in Port Talbot, which resulted in huge job losses.
Government ministers should have been better at planning ahead and making sure other green jobs were available locally, the experts said.
The independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) has set out its latest advice on how Wales reaches net zero - with a push for more electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting.
The Welsh and UK governments said they had been working together to develop ""a strong vision"" for the region's future and deliver ""our clean energy superpower mission"".
More than 2,000 jobs were lost at Tata's Port Talbot steelworks following the closure of its blast furnaces in 2024.
The move brought an end to traditional steelmaking at the site, as the company grappled with losses of over £1m a day.
It was given a £500m grant by the UK government and is now investing £1.25bn to build a new electric arc furnace by 2027.
This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site.
The changes will have a dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gases from Wales.
The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC.
But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry.
In its report, the CCC said there were ""important lessons to learn"", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared.
""The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,"" they argued.
The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened ""early and collaborative"" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said.
The Welsh government could have ensured ""the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure"", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind.
The committee said Port Talbot's experience should now be used ""to guide future efforts to decarbonise other strategically and locally-significant emissions-intensive industries,"" citing Pembroke's oil refineries as an example.
Former steelworker Shaun Spencer, who now works for a firm training electrical engineers, said he agreed with the committee's comments ""100%"".
He warned the feeling of ""resentment and bitterness"" was ""very strong"" among his former colleagues.
He added the approach had been detrimental to ""everybody's views of net zero"" and to support for the way the UK and Welsh governments deal with things, ""especially in this area"".
Emma Pinchbeck, the CCC's chief executive, told BBC news what had happened at Port Talbot was ""foreseeable and preventable"", and had ""not been the best case study"" for what a green transition should look like.
Like the UK, Wales has set a legally binding net zero target, which means that by 2050 it should no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
The CCC provides independent advice on how much can be emitted over five-year periods, known as ""carbon budgets"", and how each UK nation might achieve this.
Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero, with the latest advice covering the period between 2031-35.
The report recommends a 73% reduction in average annual emissions over this period compared to how much Wales pumped into the atmosphere in 1990.
Emissions have decreased by 37% so far and the country met its first carbon budget between 2016-2020 mainly through changes to electricity generation - such as the closure of the last remaining coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in Vale of Glamorgan.
Future cuts will rely more on all of us making choices about how we live.
The CCC has made 16 ""priority"" recommendations for immediate action.
These include supporting people to better insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating systems, drive electric vehicles or opt for public transport.
By 2033 - in just eight years' time - a third of cars and vans on Welsh roads should be electric, the committee said, and nearly a quarter of existing homes need a heat pump or similar technology.
The committee also said the Welsh government will need to support farmers and rural communities to ""diversify their income"" away from livestock farming and towards woodland creation and peatland restoration.
In 2022, agriculture was the third-highest emitting sector in Wales, accounting for 16% of Wales' emissions.
Cattle and sheep numbers should fall by 19% by 2033 due to changes in agricultural policy but also a shift in diets with less meat and dairy consumed UK-wide, the report has predicted.
The proportion of woodland cover across Wales will rise from 15% to 17% in 2033 and 26% by 2050, according to the committee's projections.
Farming union NFU Cymru said the Welsh government needed to ""reflect and consider"" whether that advice fit ""with the circumstances we have in Wales"".
""Many thousands of people rely on agriculture and livestock production,"" said the union's president Aled Jones.
The Welsh government thanked the CCC for the report which it said it would now ""review and use to set Carbon Budget 4 in regulation before the end of the year"".
A spokesman said it had been working with the UK government, the local authority and key stakeholders as part of the Tata Steel UK transition board to support affected individuals and businesses and develop a ""strong vision for the future of the region"".
It hoped do this by ""making the most of"" opportunities from new infrastructure and investment in areas such as renewable energy, he added.
The UK government said it had committed £2.5bn ""to rebuild the steel industry for decades to come as it decarbonises"".
""Decarbonisation should not mean deindustrialisation and we will ensure a bright and sustainable future for UK steelmaking,"" a spokesman added.
""We will work with the Welsh government as we deliver our clean energy superpower mission and accelerate to net zero, growing our economy and making working people better off."""
"Climate, traffic and rubbish - voters want answers",Climate change is a priority for one voter in the local county council elections on 1 May.,29 Apr 2025,Coventry & Warwickshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c045x162575o,"In the run-up to the local election the BBC is looking at the issues that matter the most to you, as part of Your Voice, Your Vote.
County councils and other authorities hold elections on 1 May.
Traffic, climate change, litter and recycling centres were important to Sarah Turner from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire.
Shop units were empty, the main road gets congested and visting household waste sites could be tricky, she said. Other people who contacted the BBC said the environment and climate change should be the county council's priority.
""On the main street in [Leamington's] Parade, there's just hardly anything, you've got so many empty shops,"" Ms Turner said.
Traffic through the town is another issue, she added, even though there was lots of cycling and walking provision.
""You'd be silly to take a job the other end of town to where you live,"" she said.
""With climate change and everything else, the Greens seem to be the only ones protecting what green spaces we've got left.""
Household recycling centres (HRCs) should be able to take rubbish from anyone, instead of charging fees for businesses to take their waste there.
""You'd think that this service would stop half of the stuff being dumped everywhere,"" she said.
Warwickshire County Council has signed up to the Leamington Town Centre Vision - a scheme designed to regenerate the town over the next decade.
It has also committed to becoming a net-zero organisation by 2030 adding it would support the county to achieve net-zero by 2050.
Candidates and parties in the Leamington Willes ward were contacted to have their say.
Will Roberts, the Green Party candidate, said:
Sarah Millar, on behalf of the Labour party, said:
Paulo Viana, candidate for the Liberal Democrats, said:
Reform UK did not respond for comment, but its national manifesto said:
The Conservative Party did not respond for comment, but its 2024 manifesto said:
Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram."
Welsh meat promoter criticised on climate comments,"A group that promotes Welsh meat has been accused of ""peddling climate change misinformation"".",27 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd32791m17o,"A group that promotes Welsh meat has been accused of ""peddling climate change misinformation"".
Hybu Cig Cymru (HCC) - Meat Promotion Wales posted on Facebook that it's a ""myth"" that ""methane emissions from cows are responsible for global warming"", attracting some criticism.
HCC chief executive Jose Peralta has since defended the post, adding that human activity was ""responsible for global warning"" and ""within that human activity, cattle production is one of them"".
But Rory Francis, director of charity Cymdeithas Eryri / Snowdonia Society, called the post ""hugely disappointing"".
""They should have a mission to explain that we should be talking to each other rather than peddling misinformation,"" he said.
Methane is the second most common greenhouse gas after CO2 and is released by livestock, such as cows and sheep, when they burp.
""I acknowledge that they are partly responsible for it, but they're not responsible exclusively for it,"" said Mr Peralta, in an interview on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.
He said the HCC's own campaign, the Welsh Way, was trying to take the lead in sustainable beef and lamb production, but that greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural industry were only part of the global issue, with transportation and energy generation also contributing.

Mr Francis said HCC had a ""good story to tell"" about Welsh farming and should not be ""basing their pitch on something which is untrue"".
He also said the organisation was funded by the Welsh government which had a ""proud record of showing leadership on the climate crisis"".
The Welsh government said HCC was an independent body and it was for it to ""decide what they publish on their social media channels"".
""We would however, like any other body, expect them to be accurate and evidence-based,"" it said."
How the political consensus in UK on climate change has shattered,"In 2019, the UK committed in law to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Now the political climate has changed.",2 May 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20znjejw1o,"When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.
Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.
Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.
The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.
Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).
So what's happened?
In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.
Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.
Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.
What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to ""how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?""
He also says the debate has become ""more polarised between left and right"" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a ""top three"" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.
He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.
""The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,"" he says.
Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls ""net stupid zero"" one of its major campaign issues.
Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.
""On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.
""The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.""
For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is ""distressing"" and he blames party politics.
""There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.""
He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a ""sensible climate majority"" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.
""Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.""
There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.
Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by ""big oil and gas"" who, she says, have been ""emboldened by Donald Trump"".
Another is that the easy things have already been done and ""we're now getting to the things that will touch on people's lives"".
Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still ""do-able"" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.
The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.
She has described the 2050 plans as ""impossible"" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to ""scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country"".
""It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.""
Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.
Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: ""On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.""
He says he wants to see a more ""market-led"" solution.
While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.
Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.
As the union Unite put it: ""If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.""
While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's ""clean power by 2030"" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.
Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.
Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.
They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.
Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.
""Labour has to be solid on it because it's a manifesto commitment and because it is a point of distinction with the parties on the right.
""If you're going to be picking up voters from the centre-left pool, you've got to have a proposition for them to vote for.""
He says the party won a big majority by promising ""big, difficult things"".
""It would be a dereliction of duty for the Labour party to win a landslide on difficult things and then go, 'do you know what, it's too difficult'.""
With so much political capital and economic hope riding on Labour's green agenda, pulling back from green targets could be fraught with danger.

The race against time to save US climate data,"Swathes of scientific data deletions are sweeping across US government websites – with decades of research at risk. Now, scientists are racing to save their work before it's lost.",23 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250422-usa-scientists-race-to-save-climate-data-before-its-deleted-by-the-trump-administration,"Swathes of scientific data deletions are sweeping across US government websites – with decades of health, climate change and extreme weather research at risk. Now, scientists are racing to save their work before it's lost.
Some of them are in the US. Others are scattered around the world. There are hundreds, many even thousands of people involved across multiple networks. And they keep a damn close eye on their phones.
No one knows when the next alert or request to save a chunk of US government-held climate data will come in. Such data, long available online, keeps getting taken down by US President Donald Trump's administration. For the last six months or so, Cathy Richards has been entrenched in the response. She works for one of several organisations bent on downloading and archiving public data before it disappears.
""You get a message at 11 o'clock at night saying, 'This is going down tomorrow',"" she says. ""You try to enjoy your day and then everything goes wrong. You just spend the night downloading data.""
Richards is a data and inclusion specialist, and civic science fellow at the Open Environmental Data Project (OEDP), a non-profit based in Hudson, New York. Her organisation is a founding member of the Public Environmental Data Project (PEDP), which emerged in 2024 to safeguard data under the Trump administration.
Some of the messages are ""heart-breaking"", says Richards. Scientists sometimes get in touch, desperate to know that data they have spent their professional lives collecting will be rescued. ""You hear the urgency,"" she says. ""You understand that this is someone's X amount of years of research and this is their baby. That's probably why we snap into action.""
In recent weeks, Richards and her colleagues have archived datasets packed with information on US flood hazards, greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and environmental justice, among other subjects. Other researchers have recreated a tool that forecasts the risk of future climate hazards around the US.
This rush to safeguard vital environmental data is part of a broader movement to rescue all kinds of scientific data published online by the US government. Biomedical and health researchers working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, have been frantically searching for ways to back up important data following executive orders issued by Trump about what information on gender and diversity may be published by federal bodies.
Scientists have expressed fears about a wide range of resources that might go next – from historical weather records to data gathered by Nasa satellites. On 16 April, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) announced that a list of datasets regarding ocean monitoring were now scheduled to be removed in early May.
Multiple organisations including the Internet Archive, a non-profit, Safeguarding Research and Culture, and the Data Rescue Project, are now engaged in activities alongside the OEDP to rescue this data from oblivion. Many of the individuals involved in these efforts have pitched in voluntarily. ""It's our library,"" says Richards. ""You gotta save the books, you have to keep it for the future.""
Shortly after President Trump's inauguration on 25 January 2025, his administration announced sweeping changes to federal departments and agencies, in a bid to reduce what it called ""waste"" and ""inefficiencies"". But many of the programmes and resources currently disappearing are critically important, scientists say. Climate researchers who spoke to the BBC pointed out that some deleted datasets have supported important research on climate change and life-threatening weather extremes, for example.
While government officials also removed information during Trump's first term, meaning scientists had expected similar deletions during his second term, the scale and scope of recent deletions has taken researchers by surprise. One scientist rushed to their university with a plea: ""I said, 'I need disk space, I need it fast, I can't really go through the normal processes [of getting] a grant',"" they recall. Their university quietly made 20 terabytes of storage available, the researcher told the BBC.
The scramble to rescue at-risk data before it's too late continues apace. Richards says her organisation has received messages from around 400 would-be volunteers and they are currently ""on-boarding"" around 100 of them. Their work could help preserve data on everything from air quality to coral reefs.
Among the tools that the PEDP has replicated on its website is EJScreen, an environmental justice mapping service that reveals communities in the US that may be at heightened risk from environmental hazards such as air pollution. It was removed from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) website in early February.
Climate data is often particularly challenging to work with given the huge size of certain datasets – vast stores of information about our planet that underpin climate models, or weather forecasting systems, for example. But this doesn't deter Richards. ""This is taxpayer-funded research that was already paid for,"" she says. The BBC contacted the White House for a comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
Watching all of this unfold – in many cases in disbelief – are the scientists who worked to collect this data in the first place.
""I have never seen anything like this in nearly 40 years of doing science,"" says Paul Bierman, a geomorphologist at the University of Vermont. ""I think it's an unmitigated disaster."" Bierman studies landscape change and human interaction with landscapes. He has researched the history of the Greenland ice sheet, showing, for example, that during the Pleistocene epoch 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, Greenland was covered in tundra and vegetation, rather than a thick ice sheet. It suggests that the ice in Greenland is more vulnerable to a changing climate than we previously understood.
Bierman explains that all of the data that he and his colleagues have collected on National Science Foundation-funded studies gets submitted to data repositories supported by that same US government agency. ""Now I'm wondering, 'Is that the safest place for my data?',"" he says.
Scientists are also worried that efforts to gather new climate data will fall by the wayside. A government report in March suggested that the Trump administration was considering cancelling the lease of the support office for a major carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring research station in Hawaii. The Mauna Loa observatory has been tracking atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1958 and just last year recorded the largest jump in such levels since records began.
""Climate science is only possible because of long-term datasets,"" says Lilian Dove, a US Noaa climate and global change research fellow at Brown University. ""Without continuing to collect that data, preserve that data, our field is in really big trouble.""
Both Bierman and Dove say they have made multiple copies of their scientific data, including in offline stores, as a precaution – to ensure its survival.
Eric Nost, a geographer at the University of Guelph in Canada, says that the data deletions have far exceeded the many revisions of US government-published information that occurred during Trump's first term, from early 2017 to early 2021. ""We saw the removal of many [web] pages,"" he says. ""We didn't really see datasets removed.""
Rachel Santarsiero, director of the Climate Change Transparency Project at the National Security Archive, a non-governmental and non-profit organisation, agrees. She adds that, during that first term, mentions of ""climate change"" were often deleted from government websites but scientific data generally remained intact and accessible.
Santarsiero also notes, however, that – in principle – the removal of environmental data resources from public-facing government websites is neither new nor exclusive to the Trump administration. The EPA announced plans to remove its online archive in 2022 while President Joe Biden was in power, for instance. ""Their rationale was it was too costly to keep the archive,"" says Santarsiero.

Another organisation that is currently working to gather and archive US government data, including climate data, is Safegaur.de. It is run largely by researchers outside the US. William Waites, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton in the UK, is among them. The pace of data deletions in recent months and weeks has been frantic, he says, with some ""scares"" over datasets that were rumoured to be earmarked for removal.
In March, word went round that information published by Noaa would disappear within days. Waites and his colleagues swung into action and started downloading multiple terabytes of data. But the rumoured deadline for the deletion came and went. Waites describes the episode as ""a good exercise for getting used to doing this"" and adds: ""It's getting a little bit easier, though, as we become more established and known for doing this – and have contacts in various organisations"".
A raft of Noaa programmes are currently at risk as the Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting the agency's funding by 25%. This would remove all funding for research on the impact of climate change on weather, for example.
The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which captures screenshots of web pages to record what they looked like in the past, is also working to cache government data. This is part of the End of Term Archive project, which records the state of US government websites at the end of presidential administrations. Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, highlights a live public spreadsheet that his colleagues are using to log such captures. The content ranges from information about LGBTQ+ equality matters to geopolitics. Plus, references to vaccines and sexually transmitted diseases were also removed from federal websites shortly after Trump's inauguration.
Many of the preserved web pages feature climate or environmental information. ""We've seen, by scope and scale, an increase in the material removed from US government websites that is without precedent,"" says Graham.
Downloading and archiving data in private or non-governmental repositories is something of a double-edged sword, however. On the one hand, it allows archivists to make multiple copies of that data. ""That limits its potential for being destroyed,"" says Lourdes Vera, a sociologist at the University at Buffalo. But Vera, who was arrested in 2020 for stealing and vandalising Trump campaign signs, points out that saving such data on platforms owned by US-based tech companies could be risky, if those companies are later compelled by the government to delete the data.
Multiple people involved in archiving initiatives expressed a motivation to store the most important information outside of the US. Though many were hesitant to discuss details. When asked whether this is something the Internet Archive is doing, for example, Graham only says: ""The Internet Archive is always looking for responsible ways to help ensure the integrity of data"".

The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.
There's another problem, though. When data goes missing from centralised – and well-known – government web pages, it's not always obvious to casual internet users that there are organisations out there working to republish it.
""You kind of have to know what you're looking for now whereas, in the past, you would have been able to more easily come by [that data] by navigating centralised data systems,"" says Nost.
It means an increasing burden not just in terms of safeguarding climate data – but also in ensuring that the public knows it is still there. And that it matters.
Given the relatively small window that humans have to act on climate change, in order to prevent its worst effects, Bierman finds the present situation incomprehensible.
""It's stunning to me that, at a time when we're seeing more intense hurricanes, greater rainfall extremities, more drought, more wildfires – why at that point would we ever imagine cutting the science that is key to addressing those issues, and keeping people safe?""

Nuclear v renewables: The coal mining town caught in Australia's climate wars,"Some worry renewed debate over Australia's energy future is reopening the ""climate wars"" of years past.",30 Apr 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx284y23p0mo,"In the Hunter Valley, long, brown trains chug through lush pastures, carrying stacks of black rock - the lifeblood of the region, though not for much longer.
This has long been Australia's coal country. But the area, a three-hour drive from Sydney, is now begrudgingly on the frontline of the country's transition to clean energy.
""This town was built around a coal mine,"" says Hugh Collins from Muswellbrook, ""so it'll be a big shift. I don't know what will happen.""
Nowhere captures this dilemma quite like the soon-to-be demolished smokestacks of Liddell power station, which tower over the rolling hillside nearby. Liddell, one of Australia's oldest coal plants, was closed two years ago. Across the highway is sister-power station Bayswater, scheduled for retirement by 2033.
Liddell's owners want to redevelop both stations into a renewable energy hub – in line with the Labor government's plans for a grid powered almost completely by solar and wind energy.
The opposition Liberal-National coalition, though, has proposed converting Liddell into one of seven nuclear power plants across the country.
Currently banned, nuclear is the controversial centrepiece of the Coalition's clean energy plan.
Nuclear has historically been deeply unpopular among Australians scared of having radioactive plants in their metaphorical backyards. But with the Coalition plugging it as a cheap and reliable option to complement renewables, interest is growing.
Ahead of the election on 3 May, each party has insisted that their visions are the best way to both fulfil Australia's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and tame rising power bills.
But there are fears this renewed debate over Australia's energy future takes the country back to the past.
Brutal arguments over climate change had plagued Australian politics for years – but the incoming Labor government last election declared that that era was over.
Now experts worry the so-called ""climate wars"" are back, and this could potentially delay the urgent emissions reduction that the globe has been begging the country to take for years.
""I don't think peace will be declared no matter what happens with the election,"" says Tony Wood from the Grattan Institute think tank.
It is hard to overstate just how central coal has been to the Hunter region.
In 1799, Newcastle, the area's biggest city, farewelled Australia's first commodity export – a shipment of coal. Today it is home to the world's largest coal port, with A$38.6bn-worth ($26.8bn; £18.9bn) passing through in 2023.
The livelihoods of about 52,000 people here rely on coal mines, power stations or supporting industries.
Made up of a handful of parliamentary seats, the region has traditionally been a Labor stronghold. But in recent years electorates like Hunter and Paterson have been faltering, and the Coalition is banking on its vision of a nuclear-powered future to win over these largely blue-collar constituents.
It says it can have the first nuclear plant up and running by 2037 and that nuclear plants will provide a similar number and range of jobs as the coal-fired power stations they're going to supersede.
""I think in the Hunter, and elsewhere to be honest, people realise that if there is not a replacement industry for coal, then these jobs go,"" opposition leader Peter Dutton said on the campaign trail.
While nuclear power has been part of the energy mix in many countries around the globe for decades, this is uncharted territory for Australia.
The country's only nuclear reactor, at Lucas Heights in Sydney, is used for medical research.
Nuclear has been banned at a federal level since the late 1990s. If the Coalition wins the election, it could convince parliament to overturn that, but persuading states to scrap their own bans on nuclear may not be so simple.
Leaders in four of the five states where nuclear plants are proposed have ruled out doing so.
Critics also say the Coalition's claims on timeframe and its $300bn price tag are unrealistic given the need to train workers, develop regulations and build the infrastructure.
Some have accused it of simply trying to prolong the use of fossil fuels - the ageing coal plants will have to run for longer to plug the energy gap.
From Mr Collins' perspective, that wouldn't be so bad. ""Being in the coal industry, I would like coal to go as long as possible,"" he says.
But he understands the need to ""embrace"" cleaner sources of energy. Though a variety of sources ""all have their place"", he is particularly interested in nuclear.
""There [may have been] a lot of scary notions around nuclear power... but technology has come a long way,"" he says, referring to deadly disasters like Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011.
But others in Muswellbrook are adamant the need for employment in the region does not outweigh the ""risks"" of nuclear.
""Liddell's closure meant a few jobs were lost but I don't think that really affected the community... I think [nuclear] is dangerous,"" says 25-year-old Chloe.
Another cafe owner simply says ""it's not going to happen"".
""We don't have the technology to build it. We can't afford it,"" he says. ""We're always going to have to burn coal, I believe.""
The topic clearly evokes strong feelings. Many people here are more than happy to share their opinions with the BBC, but are hesitant to be named or photographed. ""Our community group is ruthless,"" one woman explains.
But elsewhere in the Hunter region, it is Labor's renewables plan that is stirring heated conversation.
Renewables currently supply 46% of Australia's electricity and Labor wants to raise the proportion to 82% by 2030. As weather is unpredictable, this plan must be backed up by batteries and gas, it argues.
""Australia needs to be ambitious. We must be optimistic… We can be a renewable energy superpower for the world,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said last month, adding that this vision will create jobs in ""every part of the country"".
Ben Abbott is one of those unconvinced by these plans.
""We are not experts in energy. But where we will put our hat into the ring is when it concerns where we live. We know what's at stake,"" said Mr Abbott, who is president of No Offshore Turbines Port Stephens.
The government has earmarked a 1,854 sq km (716 sq miles) area between Newcastle and Port Stephens - a popular spot for whale watching and game fishing - as Australia's second offshore wind zone.
Mr Abbott's group is concerned that the construction and operation of wind turbines will disturb marine life – though scientists say more research is needed – and adversely affect tourism.
He also accused Labor of running a ""scare campaign"" against nuclear.
Some in the party have savaged the opposition's nuclear pitch by flooding social media with, among other things, memes featuring beloved cartoon koala Blinky Bill with three eyes.
""I'd like to learn more about it from an impartial point of view, not as a political issue,"" Mr Abbott says.
On the other hand, some have also accused the Coalition of capitalising on fear around wind farms. Billboards along the highway to Port Stephens profess that only their local candidate will ""stop Labor's offshore wind farms"".
There is also concern that local anti-renewables movements are being driven or backed by people who outright reject climate change, as a tactic to delay the country's turn away from fossil fuels. According to Guardian Australia, that includes the Saltbush Club, a group of the country's most prominent and powerful climate change deniers.
Mr Abbott says the Port Stephens campaign is not one of these. ""None of us are against renewables,"" he says, noting that he agrees with the commitment to net zero.
The conversations taking place in the Hunter region are playing out on a national level too.
Polls indicate the country is still split on the best path forward, with support for nuclear hovering around 40%, with the rest fluctuating between undecided or opposed.
For every argument from each side of the debate, there's a point to counter it on the other.
Both parties have been flouting the jobs created for communities hosting their energy infrastructure, but have been using cost-of-living relief to appeal to the nation more broadly.
However the price tag on each of these plans depends on who you ask.
Labor has for years said a grid dominated by renewables would cost A$122bn, and has dangled energy bill rebates and discounts on solar home batteries as part of its pitch.
But the Coalition says they believe it will cost at least five times more, and that their plan is half the price. They too have promised lower power bills with nuclear.
Australia's national science agency, though, says they estimate electricity generated from nuclear reactors will cost twice as much as renewable energy, even after accounting for their longer lifespans.
Environmental economics professor Frank Jotzo argues that the Coalition's promises can only be put to test a long time in the future. ""Given that Australia runs on three-year terms of government, they will not be under pressure to deliver,"" he says.
Grattan Institute's Mr Wood believes the Coalition is wielding nuclear energy as a political weapon, noting that Australia has for at least the last decade seen bipartisan support for renewables.
""They needed a point of difference. And nuclear met the objective,"" he says.
Both note the Coalition has already signalled it could abandon Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target if it wins government – while Labor says it is on track to meet it.
""A Coalition government, majority or minority, would have very big challenges introducing the nuclear proposal. I suspect we would see an escalation in the climate war,"" Mr Wood said.
But nuclear advocates are frustrated nuclear power isn't even an option here.
While Australia has abundant solar and wind resources, these are intermittent, says nuclear engineer Jasmin Diab. Nuclear is more reliable and facilities last twice as long - so she argues an ""ideal energy mix"" would be heavy on renewables with a ""backbone built on nuclear"".
""Labor's position prevents Australia from making use of what's going to be an important source of energy in the future,"" said nuclear law expert Helen Cook. She points to countries across the world already benefiting from nuclear energy, such as the US and Canada, and several others at least studying it, including Indonesia.
But Justin Page, from the Hunter Jobs Alliance, argues the Hunter doesn't have time to opt for the Coalition's ""fundamentally flawed"" plan.
The region is well on the way in its transition to renewables, he says, with proposed wind projects, for example, expected to create some 3,000 jobs.
""To go nuclear will mean starting off the ground… Such a transition will take too long and be too costly,"" he says. ""It will be ridiculous to change courses now.""
Many Hunter residents say they just want certainty.
""The best plan will be for the two parties to get together and come up with a credible, realistic and deliverable plan... rather than using such a serious issue for electioneering,"" one Newcastle resident tells us."
Climate protest jail term deemed 'disproportionate',A UN Special Rapporteur claims the sentence handed to a GP who smashed up petrol pumps is too long.,14 Apr 2025,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lmmlpmgldo,"A human rights expert has described the year-long sentence given to a climate change activist as ""blatantly disproportionate"".
Dr Patrick Hart caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to fuel pumps during a Just Stop Oil demonstration in August 2022 and said he had done so because he believed the world was in a ""truly dark and unprecedented time"".
UN Special Rapporteur Michel Forst likened the UK's toughened laws on protesters to countries such as Honduras and Azerbaijan.
The Home Office said the UK had a ""proud tradition"" of peaceful protest but people should ""do so within the law"", with one Labour MP telling the BBC Dr Hart ""deserved to be in jail"".
Dr Hart, 38, was jailed in January after causing damage to 16 fuel pumps at Thurrock Motorway Services, in Grays, Essex.
The Bristol-based GP hit the pumps with a hammer, sprayed them with orange paint and obstructed lorries refuelling the station. He was sentenced to 12 months for criminal damage.
The cost of repairing the pumps was £9,376 and the action closed the pumps for a day while repairs were carried out.
It was one of a number of Just Stop Oil protests that sparked former Conservative prime minster Rishi Sunak to describe the campaigners as ""selfish"", adding those found guilty should ""face tough sentences"".
""It's what the public expects and it's what we've delivered,"" he said.
But Mr Forst said legislation over peaceful protest in the UK needed to be repealed as he believed it to be ""draconian"".
He said: ""If you compare the situation in the UK with other European countries, you don't see such harsh sentences.
""In France you would receive a small fine, never prison. But in the UK peaceful protesters receive 12 months in prison.""
On BBC Politics West, Swindon North MP Will Stone said there was no reason for the laws to be repealed by Labour.
He said: ""This was not a peaceful protest, this is someone destroying property. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.""
Stone said Dr Hart ""should be in jail"" for what he had done, adding he disagreed with the views of the UN Special Rapporteur.
Dr Hart told the BBC, during a phone interview from prison, he believed his action had been justified.
When challenged about the  seriousness of his offences and the possibility he would repeat them, Dr Hart added: ""The way it is presented in the justice system is this is a pattern of offending which seems absurd to me.
""I am not doing this out of any benefit of my own. I am doing it out of entirely selfless reasons because I am terrified for human civilisation or the lack of a future.
""It is very unlikely I will go out and do the same things again.""
Dr Hart said he believed his actions had been justified as the primary duty of a doctor was to ""act in the best interests of our patients"".
""I just came to appreciate the climate crisis is the greatest risk to all our health and anything else I can be doing is meaningless and the most meaningful thing I can do is to try to defeat that,"" he said.
""It's very odd to me that damaging inanimate objects is considered no longer peaceful.
""As a doctor, if it's an emergency and you are brought in unconscious, I am going to cut through your clothes – even if they are expensive designer, just to get to the wound, if it's bleeding and could lead to death.
""That is not considered violent, that is considered life-saving.""
But former Conservative MP Richard Graham disagreed with his views, saying the protest ""wasn't peaceful at all"".
""This was an extremely expensive, aggressive, tiresome behaviour,"" he said.
""And very odd, frankly, from a GP who should be looking after patients in a very reasonable, apportioned way.""
The Green Party's deputy leader on Bristol City Council said protests had made a ""significant difference"" to government policy.
Mr Forst said he had been ""very moved"" after a visit with Dr Hart in Chelmsford prison.
He has threatened to refer the British government to the UN's Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee if it does not respond fully to his legal opinion.
Additionally, Dr Hart also had his General Medical Council (GMC) registration suspended for an interim 12-month period, and faces a possible further suspension following his release.
""Dr Hart has already been punished by the UK judicial system for his climate activism,"" Mr Forst said.
""He has been prosecuted, convicted and sanctioned for his involvement in peaceful civil disobedience.
""One of the courts that convicted him also recognised that Dr Hart's motivations were entirely altruistic.""
Mr Forst questioned what the GMC was trying to achieve ""by depriving him from the very possibility to be a doctor"".
He said it would be ""punishing him for a second time, for having taken action to address what the GMC itself calls 'one of the greatest threats to human health'"".
""Added to his conviction by a court, this professional sanction would not only be a form of penalisation, persecution or harassment of Dr Hart, it would also be one that is based on an astonishingly paradoxical reasoning,"" he said.
A GMC spokesperson said it was ""committed to doing what we can to tackle climate change"" but it was for Parliament to determine whether UK law relating to protests needed to change.
The guidance for doctors, the GMC added, was they were allowed ""personal political opinions"" but a custodial sentence would lead to a referral to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.
""This is required by law, and we can't exercise any discretion over this,"" the spokesperson added.
""When doctors' protesting results in law-breaking, they must understand it is their actions in breaking the law, rather than their motivations, that will be under scrutiny.
""Patients and the public have a high degree of trust in doctors, that trust can be put at risk when doctors fail to comply with the law.""

Canada's top candidates talk up fossil fuels as climate slips down agenda,"Amid tariff threats from the US, energy and economic security are key issues in Canada's federal election.",22 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pev3jpyyo,"As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.
The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.
Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.
It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.
In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.
That sense of unity is now long gone.
Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.
As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.
However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.
The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.
It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as ""Carbon Tax Carney"".
Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.
""By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,"" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.
""I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.""
Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into ""a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy"".
He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.
There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.
Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.
The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.
""We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,"" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.
""And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.""
Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.
He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers ""woke"" cultural issues.
Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.
While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace ""dirty coal"" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.
According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.
He told the BBC it's more ""at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable"".
Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.
That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.
Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.
""Our relationship with the US has completely changed,"" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.
""The pipelines are a national security problem for us.""
That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.
A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.
In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track ""energy corridors"",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.
He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.
And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.
Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a ""denial situation about climate change"".
""I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales"" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.
Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.
As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.
Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.
Canadians go to the polls on 28 April."
Australia opposition leader clarifies he believes in climate change after debate,Peter Dutton is facing outrage after comments he made on climate change during an election debate.,17 Apr 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq9pr47ejo,"Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton has clarified he believes in climate change after facing backlash for comments made during an election debate on Wednesday night.
Dutton and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese were asked about the increasing impact of climate change, to which Dutton replied he would ""let scientists and others pass that judgment"".
He had previously said that flooding and natural disasters were ""part of the history of our state of this country"". The comments generated outrage from climate groups and mockery from Albanese.
""I believe in climate change, and that it is a reality"" Dutton said while campaigning on Monday.

During Wednesday's debate, Dutton responded to the moderator's question on whether flooding and natural disasters were getting worse by saying, ""I don't know because I'm not a scientist"".
""I can't tell you whether the temperature has risen in Thargomindah because of climate change or the water levels are up,"" he added.
Meanwhile Albanese, who had said Dutton's words showed ""no acceptance of the science of climate change"" continued mocking his opponent on Thursday, asking ""does he believe in gravity?""
Environmental organisations have reacted to Dutton's debate remarks with dismay.
Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie told the Guardian ""it's outrageous for a senior political leader to be so out of touch that they claim they ""don't know"" the risks Australians are facing.""
A report from the non-profit released earlier this month stated one in 23 properties across the country were found to be at high risk from climate change.
Australian Conservation Foundation Chief Executive Kelly O'Shanassy called Dutton's words ""a serious concern"" in an interview with the Canberra Times, adding that ""the next parliament is the last parliament that can get Australia's massive contribution to climate change under control.""
Albanese was also questioned on his climate policy during the debate, though for different reasons.
The prime minister has championed renewable energy throughout his time in office, but has faced backlash for rising power bills.
Asked when fees would fall, the prime minister did not directly reply. Instead, he stressed renewables were the ""cheapest form of power"".
In March, Labor announced it would extend a relief system for the bills, providing a further automatic $150AUD ($95;£72) rebate to households and small businesses.
The hour-long debate also saw the two party leaders pressed on other hot button issues for Australia including housing and foreign policy, in particular Australia's relationship to the US."
City's Pride cancelled over 'economic climate',Hereford Pride has been cancelled and the organisation in charge is being closed down.,8 Apr 2025,Hereford & Worcester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9eyyk2z5o,"A city's Pride event has been cancelled and the organisation in charge is being closed down, due to ""the current economic climate.""
Hereford Pride, a community interest company, made the announcement on Tuesday, saying it ""hasn't been an easy decision for anyone currently involved in the organisation.""
A spokesperson for the group said: ""The current economic climate being such as it is, and the dedication, commitment and energy required for such a project, wasn't ultimately sustainable.
""Like with any Pride, the organisation and running relies solely on volunteers, even at director level, with funding very difficult to obtain.""
The organisation said all strategic options had been explored, including new people taking on the project, but said nothing could be facilitated.
They added: ""Now more than ever, Prides all round the world are vital to giving a voice to LGBTQ+ people, so this makes us very sad we've had to come to such a decision.""
Hereford Pride was formed by the late John Walker, who the organisation said was a ""pioneer"" for LGBTQ+ rights and ""a passionate man who strived to make Hereford a beacon of hope for the community that he loved most dear.""
""We are deeply saddened that we were unable to continue his legacy but hope he would understand,"" they said.

Woman finds rare venomous centipede in flat,The arthropods are more commonly found in warmer climates than the UK.,4 days ago,Lancashire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ep202037ro,"A young woman has spoken of her shock after finding a venomous centipede in her flat.
Orlaith Armour said she spotted the ""strange creature"" on her kitchen wall after she returned from a late shift at Wetherspoons.
The 19-year-old later found the many-legged minibeast was a rare Scutigera coleoptrata, which uses venom to kill its prey but is not harmful to humans.
""I had never seen anything like it before. After asking my co-workers, we figured out it was a house centipede,"" she said.
Steve Gregory, who runs the British Myriapod and Isopod Group's recording scheme, said the Scutigera coleoptrata was commonly known as the house centipede.
He said the species originates from the Mediterranean and, at present, can only survive our cold winters inside buildings.
Mr Gregory said sightings of the insect, which uses its venom to subdue and feed on flies and spiders, are becoming more common in Britain.
He added that people who end up unintentionally housing one do not not need to worry as they are not dangerous to humans.
""Although once very rare, it is expanding its range, possibly due to climate change,"" he said.
""There were only three known sightings up to 1990, about 30 sighting between 1990 and 2020, and in 2024 there were over triple this number.
""These are mostly from southern England, but in recent years it has been seen as far north as Lancashire and Yorkshire.""
Ms Armour, who moved to Lytham St Annes from Scotland two years ago, said she enlisted a brave colleague to help her catch the creature and released it.
""From what I've learned, house centipedes are harmless and actually beneficial because they prey on other household pests,"" she said.

O'Neill brands DUP's climate change vote a 'dereliction of duty',MLAs were debating regulations brought by the Executive Office that will provide powers to appoint a commissioner.,8 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6n2pn82yo,"A decision by the DUP to vote against a plan for a climate change commissioner has been branded a ""dereliction of duty"" by First Minister Michelle O'Neill.
MLAs were debating regulations brought by the Executive Office that will provide powers to appoint a commissioner.
The DUP has previously questioned the cost of the office, estimated at £1m a year, with Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly saying she saw ""no need"" for the specific role.
The role was agreed in the Climate Change Act, passed by the assembly in 2022.
But the legal duty to recruit and appoint someone to the position falls to the first and deputy first ministers.
The commissioner would oversee progress made by executive departments against targets in areas like net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
O'Neill said unionist opposition to the role being created was ""illogical"" and said the assembly had a ""moral duty"" to help tackle climate change.
Emma Little-Pengelly distanced herself from some of the first minister's personal remarks.
She said the move was being brought forward by the office of first and deputy first ministers due to a legal requirement however, she personally has concerns over cost, added value and timing.
Ulster Unionist MLA, Robbie Butler said it would be ""penny wise and pound foolish"" for the DUP to suggest that the estimated cost of the commissioner's office would be spent on other areas.
He said it was not something that could be used as a ""trade off"".
Reflecting on the current wildfires in the Mourne Mountains, Butler said that because of climate change ""the fire loading in those mountains and grassland areas is significant worse than it was 20 years ago - this is not about climate denial"".
The chair of the Executive Office (TEO) committee, Paula Bradshaw accused the DUP of opposition at ""last moment"", she outlined that the plan for a climate change commissioner was discussed at least five times in the TEO committee.
Responding to the DUP's Harry Harvey, Bradshaw said: ""You had the opportunity on many occasions to raise these concerns, to ask TEO officials for some guidance and information and you never took that opportunity.""
Some 51 MLAs voted in favour of progressing with the role, while the DUP and the TUV voted against it."
Attenborough at 99 delivers 'greatest message he's ever told',Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.,8 days ago,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0wjxg0ex1o,"Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.
He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.
Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: ""After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.""
The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.
The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.
In attendance was the King, told Sir David he ""can't believe"" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.
The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.
A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.
Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a ""private capacity"", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.
Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. ""This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,"" he says.
The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.
Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  ""I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot – momentarily – to breathe.""
Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  ""We are almost out of time,"" he warns.
Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling – a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.
The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.
""It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,"" comments Sir David.
The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.
Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the ""most remarkable discovery of all"" – that the ocean can ""recover faster than we had ever imagined"".
Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.
It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.
Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: ""I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.""
But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.
One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  ""When I first met David, I was in shorts,"" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes – one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. ""He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.""
Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. ""Every time you work with David, you learn something new,"" he says.  ""It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.""
Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.
He believes that could be transformational.
""The ocean can bounce back to life,"" Sir David says. ""If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.""
A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.
""In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,"" Sir David says.
As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.
Ocean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.

Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record,"The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and April created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread.",27 Apr 2025,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gm3jwljo,"The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests.
More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.
That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.
The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.
Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.
The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.
The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).
More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.
Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.
""We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,"" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.
""This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.""
A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.
""The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,"" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.
""Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.""
The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.
The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.
In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.
A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.
Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.
These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.
Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.
Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.
Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.
""My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,"" said Prof Rein, when ""there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic"".
""You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.""
The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.
But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.
A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme ""fire weather"" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.
Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.
""One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,"" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.
""We need to be prepared for this to become more common.""

The farm where every day is a perfect summer's day,"Basil, coriander and lettuce leaves are being nurtured in an unusual farm in Bracknell.",1 day ago,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced2172vzq8o,"With climate change making life increasingly difficult for some farmers, and rising political tensions around the world often disrupting the food supply chain, a Berkshire company is looking at how we can become more self-sufficient.
The Innovation Agritech Group is growing crops indoors 365 days a year.
Hard to grow in the British climate, basil, coriander and lettuce leaves are being nurtured on a series of 16ft by 16ft (5m by 5m) vertical panels.
Italy this is not, but, at IAG's indoor farm in Bracknell, the agricultural technology company is looking at providing herbs and foods in the UK all year round.
Farmers fear what a prolonged dry spell will mean for harvests later this year. Last year, England suffered its second worst on record.
When not looking after her 300 cattle on her farm near Swindon, Wiltshire, Liz Webster heads up the Save British Farming campaign group.
She said the changing climate is a huge challenge to her industry.
Government policies in recent years have prioritised the environment over food production, she said, adding: ""We have exposed ourselves to a huge deluge of imports, which is destroying our home production and that's plainly ludicrous.""
Experts such as the University of Reading's Prof Richard Tiffin have said while the UK does import huge quantities of fruit and vegetables, it is more self-sufficient than most, at least when it comes to the basics.
The director of science said it was a different story when it comes to soft fruits and more exotic vegetables.
""We're about 75% self-sufficient when it comes to things we can produce domestically. In fruit, we're probably around 15% self-sufficient,"" he said.
""However, the last thing you want is to be 100% self-sufficient. Not only is it extremely difficult to achieve but that also means you're at the behest of the weather in your own country.""
He said we could take a leaf from the Netherlands' book.
The Dutch are masters of growing the most fragile of fruits and herbs indoors, in tightly controlled environments, he said.
""They're a relatively small land country and it's undoubtedly the case the government has invested heavily in some of these indoor production facilities and we're probably behind that,"" said Prof Tiffin.
""They're a role model we should be following.""
In Bracknell, IAG is taking the weather and climate change out of the equation, creating an indoor farm where every day is a perfect summer's day
The lighting system mimics the rise and fall of the sun, with the light each plant gets tweaked to suit the species' individual preference.
IAG's commercial director Dean Barron said plants in most indoor farms sit in water trays using a system called hydroponics
But IAG is planting individual seedlings in coir plugs, where minimal water is used.
He said: ""We use a system called aeroponics because we believe that getting oxygen to the roots is a lot better than having it stood in water.""
The system uses 95% less water than standard agriculture and 30-35% less than hydroponic processes, said Mr Barron.
Growing everything this way means they are also immune from outside events like the war in Ukraine or the flash floods which hit parts of Spain last autumn, destroying thousands of hectares of fruit and vegetables.
""We can grow in here 365 days a year. Border closures don't then come into play so we won't have to rely on imports that way either, whether that be by sea, air or whatever.,"" Mr Barron said.
Indoor farming is just one of the solutions being looked at to make our food sector more secure.
But there is one big problem - power costs.
Facilities like IAG's hoover up large amounts of electricity.
No-one is suggesting we should be aiming to produce everything indoors but Prof Tiffin said we could do much worse than follow the lead of the country better known for tulips, windmills and clogs."
Blow to clean energy drive as major UK windfarm ditched,"In a blow to the government's clean energy ambitions, a company cancels a huge windfarm off Yorkshire.",7 days ago,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce848g8l8vro,"In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire.
The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW – enough to power more than a million homes.
Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price.
The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged.
A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised ""the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe.""
But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project.
The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs.
Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through.
However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target – one of the Labour government's five central ""missions"".
Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass – organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 – so in just five years' time.
In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy.
It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment.
Many local communities are pushing back at the prospect of major new energy infrastructure near their homes.
Some industry experts - as well as the Conservative and Reform parties – say the 2030 target is not achievable.
Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, has long argued building out this infrastructure in the timescale would be near impossible.
""In failing to meet a very short-term target, it is going to maximise the costs of trying,"" he has warned.
Chris Stark, the head of the government's Clean Power 2030 mission, has conceded the target will be – as he put it - ""bloody hard"", but that with a ""Herculean effort"" it can be met.
Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, accepts the plan it is ambitious and controversial but is adamant that it is essential to: ""cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security.""
The government has said it plans to work with Orsted to get Hornsea 4 ""back on track"" and said it believed the clean power mission was still achievable.
""We have a strong pipeline of projects to deliver clean power by 2030 and our mission-led approach ensures we can steer our way through global pressures and individual commercial decisions to reach our targets,"" a spokesperson said.

Blair says UK's net zero policies 'doomed to fail',The former PM's call for a change of course is rejected by Downing Street but welcomed by the Tories and Reform.,30 Apr 2025,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvrwyp0jx3o,"Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is ""doomed to fail"".
In a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters ""feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal"".
He does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.
The Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the ""mad dash"" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.
In its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.
At the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.
Writing in the foreword, Sir Tony says: ""Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.""
He says ""any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail"".
He also warns against the ""alarmist"" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is ""riven with irrationality"".
The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.
It also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it ""is a paper that is about increased climate ambition"".
Lindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  ""We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.""
Ms Fursman said the report was ""pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise"".
Downing Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.
""We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,"" said the prime minister's official spokesman.
""Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.""
The government claims its net zero strategy is already delivering results, with £43bn of private investment since last July and that its climate policies ""now support around 600,000 jobs across the UK"".
Labour sources are also pushing back against claims Sir Keir Starmer is going cold on the net zero agenda, pointing to a speech he made last week in which he said the clean energy mission was ""in the DNA of my government"".
Reacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed ""with a lot of what it says"" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI ""which the government are doing"".
But Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.
Writing on social media, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: ""Even Tony Blair now says the push for Net Zero has become 'irrational' and 'hysterical'. We are winning the argument!""
Conservative acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie said the government needed to ""urgently  change course"".
""It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,"" he added.
Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: ""Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.""
Sir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups.
One campaigner told the BBC: ""This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access.
""The Labour government are getting on with many of the policies outlined in the report because they know this is popular with people, especially the voting coalition they need to maintain for the next election.
""But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.""
A Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: ""There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation.
""But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.""

UK government defends net-zero policies after Blair criticism,"Former PM Sir Tony Blair says limiting fossil fuels is ""doomed to fail"" and a new approach is needed.",30 Apr 2025,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq80974l402o,"The government has defended its net-zero policies after Sir Tony Blair said limiting fossil fuels was ""doomed to fail"" and a new approach was needed.
The ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become ""irrational"" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices ""when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal"".
His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.
Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: ""If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.""
Labour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.
Minutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they ""support the government's 2050 net zero targets"" and that the UK government's approach is ""the right one"".
Questioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I won't get into private conversations.""
Sir Keir's spokesman also stressed that the PM had confidence in Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, adding that he was ""doing a great job"".
But he said the PM did not agree with Sir Tony that there was too much ""hysteria"" in the climate change debate.
He told reporters: ""I don't think so, I mean I think we're taking a very practical and pragmatic approach to this here in the UK.""
He added: ""Our approach to net zero is clear. It is families up and down this country that will pay the price for the UK's dependence on fossil fuel markets.""
Nicholas Stern - who wrote an influential report on the economics of climate change for Tony Blair when he was in government in 2006 - described the report from the Tony Blair Institute as ""muddled and misleading"".
He said there was ""far more progress being made around the world to decarbonise the global economy than it suggests"" and that it did not take account of the UK's leadership in the field.
""If the UK wobbles on its route to net zero, other countries may become less committed. The UK matters,"" said Prof Stern, who chairs the Grantham Research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics.
The TBI report argues that the expected global rise in fossil fuel use and the doubling of airline travel over the next 20 years undermines current climate policies.
""These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail,"" Sir Tony wrote in the foreward to the report.
The report says existing carbon targets should be kept in place to give certainty to business but a rethink of how they are achieved was urgently needed.
It says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international efforts to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.
To help achieve the 2050 target, Labour and the previous Conservative government made a series of pledges including ""clean"" electricity, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and installing 600,000 electric heat pumps a year by 2028.
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch recently ditched her party's support for net zero by 2050.
Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins said there was ""consensus across the board"" on the need to protect the environment, but that ""we have to take the public with us"".
And she said Sir Tony had sent a ""clear message"" to the government that it needs to ""rethink"" its approach to net zero.
In a sign of the acrimony swilling around this debate within Labour, one government source suggested Sir Tony's comments may have been affected by the Tony Blair Institute having received funding from oil rich Saudi Arabia.
The TBI says it is ""editorially independent"".
The Labour Party has had a complicated relationship with Sir Tony and his legacy since he left Downing Street in 2007.
Ed Miliband's election as leader in 2010 over his brother, David, was seen in part as a repudiation of Blairism, as was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to a much greater extent.
But since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in 2020 he has often embraced the most electorally-successful leader in Labour's history. He has also hired some of the leading figures from Sir Tony's Downing Street.
Jonathan Powell, Downing Street chief of staff under Sir Tony, is now Sir Keir's national security adviser, and Liz Lloyd, a former deputy chief of staff, is now back as director of policy delivery.
Lord Mandelson, one of Sir Tony's closest political friends and a former cabinet minister, is now the UK ambassador to Washington.
It comes as a highly critical report by the independent Climate Change Committee says Labour has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power.

"Australia Greens leader loses seat, cites 'Trump effect'","Adam Bandt was ousted by a ""riptide"" of swing votes, which he blamed on the so-called Trump effect.",6 days ago,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04e99315pzo,"The leader of Australia's third-largest political party, the Greens, has conceded his seat in Melbourne after a tight electoral vote count that lasted several days.
Adam Bandt, who had safely held the seat of Melbourne since 2010, told reporters on Thursday afternoon that he had called Labor candidate Sarah Witty to congratulate her on her victory.
Australia's centre-left Labor party won Saturday's federal election by a landslide, decimating the conservative Liberal-National Coalition while also gutting the left-leaning Greens.
While the Greens got the highest vote in Melbourne, Bandt said the main reason for their loss was the preference votes for Liberal and the far-right One Nation party.
Australia uses a preferential voting system, where candidates are ranked in order of preference.
If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are redistributed, and that process is repeated until someone secures a majority.
""To win in Melbourne we needed to overcome Liberal, Labor and One Nation combined, and it's an Everest we've climbed a few times now, but this time we fell just short,"" Bandt said.
""We came very close,"" he added, ""but we couldn't quite get there.""
Bandt also cited the so-called Trump effect as a ""key defining feature of the election"" - the Coalition's PM candidate Peter Dutton was often compared to the US President, which he rejected but it stuck.
Bandt said that contributed to a five-week ""riptide"" that saw votes swing away from Liberal and Dutton, and towards Labor.
This same effect also pulled votes away from the Greens, he added: ""The riptide from Liberal to Labor had an effect on us as well.""
""People in Melbourne hate Peter Dutton, and with very good reason. They've seen his brand of toxic racism for many years... and like me, many wanted him as far away from power as possible.
""My initial take is some votes leaked away from us, as people saw Labor as the best option to stop Dutton.""
Like Bandt, Dutton also lost his seat in the election, adding to his resounding defeat at the polls by incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
Bandt, who has been leader of the Greens since 2020, said he wanted to thank the Melbourne community for ""regularly giving me the highest vote, including this election, and to thank you for the last 15 years and the chance to do some amazing things together"".
He listed off a string of achievements by the Greens under his leadership, including the party's pivotal role in the marriage equality plebiscite, the First Nations Voice to Parliament referendum, and advancing ""world-leading climate legislation"".
""Fighting the climate crisis is the reason I got into politics, and I want to thank everyone in Melbourne for helping us make a difference,"" Bandt said.
He also thanked his party colleagues, noting that he leaves the party with ""the vote for the Greens higher than when i started, and our biggest ever representation in parliament"".
Bandt thanked the African and Muslim communities in Melbourne, as well as ""everyone that had the courage to speak up against the invasion of Gaza, and spoke up for peace in Palestine"".
Finally, he thanked his wife, Claudia.
""Not only could I have not done this without her, we've done it together,"" he said.
In his closing remarks, Bandt offered some ""free advice to the media"".
""We're in a climate crisis,"" he said. ""I really want the media to stop reporting on climate as a political issue, and start thinking of it as if our country were being invaded. We should treat the climate crisis as if there was a war on.""
""Please, please start taking the climate crisis seriously, and holding this government and any future government to account."""
The satellite that will 'weigh' world's 1.5 trillion trees,The new satellite will be able to see through clouds and forest canopies.,29 Apr 2025,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crldwjj6d6no,"The world's rainforests are often referred to as the ""lungs of the earth"".
They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.
But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.
On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.
It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.
The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.
The satellite on board has been affectionately named ""space brolly"" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.
""We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,"" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.
He said that it would be a major achievement ""to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia"".
The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.
""Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,"" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.
""But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,"" he said.
The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.
It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.
Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a ""huge challenge"" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.
""Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,"" he said. ""Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.
""Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.""
On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.
The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: ""The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.""
Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.
""Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,"" said Dr Cordey.
Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.
L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.
The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.
These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.
""The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,"" said Prof Disney.
Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.
It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.
""It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,"" said Dr Cordey. ""Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.""

Council leader 'will not take diversity training',Sean Matthews discussed his party's stance on the matter on Politics North.,3 days ago,Lincolnshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2kylzv40eo,"The new leader of Lincolnshire County Council says he will not take part in diversity training in his new role.
Speaking on BBC Politics North, Reform UK's Sean Matthews also said he was not interested in climate change and that his priorities were to save money and ""cut out the waste"".
Earlier in the week, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage posted on social media that all people should be treated equally and any UK Reform councillor instructed to take part in diversity or climate change training would ""do no such thing"".
The Green Party's Natalie Bennett said diversity training was a good use of taxpayers' money and said ""to be that dismissive is really, deeply disturbing"".
Matthews was announced as the county council's new leader on Thursday after Reform took control from the Conservative Party in the elections on 1 May.
""I've not been asked to do any diversity training, which is a good start,"" he said.
""I think that the staff here may have an inkling as to what sort of response they would get from me. So that's not happening, as far as I'm concerned, unless it's hidden in the undergrowth somewhere.
""And as far as climate change is concerned.. I'm not interested.""
Echoing comments made last week by the county's new mayor Dame Andrea Jenkyns, he said that diversity officers are called ""different things"" and said ""we've got to get a grip of that"".
Presenter Tim Iredale asked Bennett if she thought diversity training was a good use of taxpayers' money.
She said: ""Absolutely, because I think that we have long-term historical prejudices, long-term historical discrimination.
""Fixing that is not just the right thing to do morally, it's the thing that ensures that we have the best possible council services, that we are able to engage everyone in our community and that the council services meet the needs of everybody in that community.
""We surely should want to ensure that everyone in our community can flourish, can have the best opportunities to participate and to be that dismissive is really, deeply disturbing.""
Now the opposition on the council, the Conservative group leader, councillor Richard Davies, said: ""Lincolnshire County Council is a well run, prudently financially managed authority, delivering really important services.
""This is not a political football to be kicked around.
""[Reform UK have] made a lot of commitments around borrowing, about council tax, about improving services, that we will hold them to account to deliver.""

Council Green Party group leader steps down,Nicola Day says she hopes to spend more time in her community and focus on the climate crisis.,8 days ago,Peterborough,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgngejqlqqo,"A councillor who has led her local party for four years says she is standing down from her position to focus more on the community and the climate crisis.
Nicola Day has been the Green Party group leader on Peterborough City Council since May 2021 and is stepping aside to let current deputy leader Heather Skibsted take over.
The party has five councillors on the authority and gained two seats from the Conservatives during the 2024 election.
She said she wanted to spend more time with the ""residents I represent"".
Day, who represents the Orton Waterville ward, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""I would also like to focus my time and energy on of the most pressing issues of our time - the climate crisis - and how we mitigate and adapt to that whilst improving our local environment.""
Ms Skibsted has been with the party for almost three years and has represented Orton Longueville since 2019.
She said: ""I now have time in my life to focus on helping to push forward the Green agenda which includes protecting our green spaces, for example, the Embankment [in Peterborough], and ensuring new builds include the necessary adjustments to cope with our changing climate.
""We are also continuously promoting the protection of public services and community spaces.""
While she has been described by Day as a ""very hard-working, principled and trust colleague"", the new party leader says she has ""big shoes to fill"".

"Wales facing unrecognisable future, warns commissioner","Wales faces ""unrecognisable future"" without urgent action, future generations commissioner says.",29 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9j739k28o,"Wales faces an ""unrecognisable future"" without urgent action to protect the environment, tackle poverty and ill health, the country's future generations commissioner has said.
The unique job was created ten years ago with a law which now forces public bodies to consider the long-term impacts of all decisions.
But Derek Walker, who was appointed to the role in 2022, told the BBC he had been ""frustrated at progress"" as the Wales Audit Office also warned of a failure to achieve ""system-wide change"".
The Welsh government said it would review the recommendations carefully before responding formally.
As part of the role, Wales' future generations commissioner writes a progress report every five years, to be published a year before a Senedd election.
It provides advice on the actions required to protect the Welsh citizens of today as well as ""those yet to be born"", Mr Walker explained.
While pointing to successes such as Wales' world-leading recycling rate and investment in sustainable transport, he warned of ""significant"" challenges.
These include climate change and the collapse of nature, with 1 in 6 species currently facing extinction from Wales.
There are also 273,000 homes at risk of flooding, a figure projected to double within 100 years, as a result of changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.
While there is a Welsh government target for public sector organisations to reach net zero by 2030 - meaning they no longer contribute to global warning - the report found many concerned about whether they could actually achieve it and needing ""significant additional resources"".
On the other hand, the fact that there was no legally-binding nature recovery target in Wales meant that part of the problem ""was not given sufficient priority"" by the public sector, the report said.
Tougher enforcement of those polluting the environment was also called for, with new legislation needed to give Natural Resources Wales powers to issue civil sanctions, such as stop orders and fines.
Other challenges include poverty levels that remained ""unacceptably high"".
Nearly one third (29%) of children in Wales live in poverty, while more than 1 in 5 of the population as a whole lived in relative income poverty between 2021-23.
The report called on every public body to commit to a plan within two years that sets out how it would offer the voluntary Real Living Wage - so far only 13 out of 56 have done so.
The commissioner also said Wales ""cannot afford to keep treating preventable diseases without addressing their underlying causes"".
NHS Wales spends £1 out of every £10 they have on diabetes, for instance, yet ""most Type 2 diabetes cases are preventable"" with healthy eating and exercise.
Wales currently has the highest percentage of people living with diabetes in the UK, while around one in four adults are obese.
Life satisfaction and anxiety levels among adults are worsening, and in 2025 many can expect to spend the last 20 years of their lives in ill health.
As the NHS grapples with the population's acute care needs, funding for preventative measures has been cut.
The report described this as ""an act of collective self-sabotage"", warning the health service was ""increasingly overwhelmed with preventable diseases and accidents"".
The commissioner also warned that ""culture is in crisis"" in Wales, insisting the arts were ""not a nice-to-have"" but rather vital to people's well-being.
The capacity of the Welsh public sector was described as being ""at breaking point"" due to rising demand and years of austerity.
Wales became the first country in the world to legislate for the rights of citizens not-yet-born, when the Well-being of Future Generations Act was passed in 2015.
Ten years on, today's progress report finds ""strong support"" across the public sector.
From Welsh government ministers down to those running schools and hospitals, they are now all meant to be evaluating the long-term impacts of their decisions and working collaboratively to tackle future threats such as climate change and growing health inequalities.
But the report found many Public Service Boards - set up to bring different organisations together - were not working well, lacked resources and support.
Leadership approaches across public sector organisations also needed to change in order to successfully implement the Act, it said.
The report calls on the next government to launch a review of the Act, including ""a public dialogue on the Wales we want for future generations"".
In a separate study, also published on Tuesday, the Wales Audit Office found the Act was ""not driving the system-wide change that was intended"".
""We see good examples, but we also see instances where public bodies have given little or no explicit consideration to the Act,"" it said, singling out the health system in particular.
Derek Walker said Wales had ""led the way for the past 10 years with our collective vision for a Cymru that's protecting future generations"".
""But we're not on target to meet our health, climate and nature goals that will get us there,"" he warned.
""Future generations will live with the consequences of every decision we take to improve people's lives and with trust in public institutions in decline, we must listen more, engage meaningfully with people's concerns, and involve them without delay.""
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Ten years of the Future Generations Act has changed how we work and think about sustainable development, and how we deliver for people and the planet, now and for the future.
""We thank the commissioner and the auditor general for their reports, which highlight achievements such as progress on the circular economy and greater use of the Act, while also identifying areas needing urgent attention.
""We are committed to the Act and are reviewing the recommendations carefully before responding formally."""
Carbon capture company wins $5m to scale up,"Researchers at Newcastle University were ""instrumental"" in developing the technology, UNDO says.",3 May 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn054gj8dwro,"A carbon capture company has won a $5m international prize to scale up its work.
UNDO, founded by Jim Mann, won an Xprize competition offering cash prizes for projects that could combat climate change.
It followed a Newcastle University study at Nafferton Farm in Northumberland which demonstrated that spreading volcanic dust on farmland, a material that captures carbon from the air, could also increase crop yields by more than 20%.
Mr Mann, who is a former Durham University ecology student, said the collaboration with Newcastle University was ""instrumental"" in advancing the technology.
Basalt rock found in soil in the north-east of England was crushed into dust and given to farmers, in field tests published last year.
Newcastle professor David Manning, who led the study, said: ""Research at Nafferton Farm has shown that, in a bad year for crop growth, use of basaltic rock dust gives increased yields, suggesting that it is particularly helpful when plants are under stress.""
Following the prize win, Manufacturer UNDO said it would ""remain focused on building the foundations for a world where enhanced rock weathering becomes a common farming practice"".
The main winner of the XPrize competition was India's Mati Carbon, which was awarded $50m.
UNDO was one of three runners-up, with Canada's Planetary receiving $1m for ocean work and the UAE's Project Hajar awarded $1m for direct air capture.

Map shows 80% of peatlands dry and degraded,"The government say the findings, shown on an open source map, present a worrying picture.",2 days ago,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8zg4y8979o,"New mapping data has shown 80% of England's peatlands to be dry and damaged.
The government said the findings, shown on an open source map, presented a worrying picture, with degraded peat emitting carbon into the atmosphere and contributing to global heating.
Healthy peat is the country's biggest carbon store but when damaged it releases planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Meanwhile, the most extensive peatland habitat was shown to be found across parts of the Lake District, the Pennines, North York Moors and in the uplands of the south-west of England.
Scientists have used satellite imagery, artificial intelligence and in-depth data analysis to create the most complete map of England's peatland and peaty soils to date, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.
As vital carbon sinks, healthy peatlands can help tackle climate change, reduce flood risk, improve water quality and support rare wildlife, including the golden plover, curlews and 25 species of dragonflies.
The map models the extent, depth and important aspects of the condition of England's peat, including vegetation, gullies and man-made as well as natural draining channels.
It found that peaty soil covers roughly 8.5% of England's surface with four-fifths of England's peatlands also revealed to be in a dry and degraded state.
The map showed that three-quarters of the surface was shown to be covered by plants and land use types associated with dryer conditions such as heather, while only 1% is covered by important peat-forming plants such as sphagnum moss.
Cumbria Wildlife Trust said it was looking to restore some of its peatlands, which were historically burned to help heat homes last year.
Meanwhile, in Dartmoor, the University of Exeter estimates just 1% of its deep peat is healthy, peat-forming bog.
Efforts to restore this vital natural resource are under way, including in Exmoor, Dartmoor and Cornwall, but scientists are warning climate change could make that difficult.
Natural England's chief scientist, Dr Sallie Bailey, said: ""Mapping peat to this level of detail will help us maximise the benefits of peat and massively advances our understanding the role our peatlands are playing in a changing climate.""
Tony Juniper, chairman of Natural England, said the map ""would allow us to make far better and more informed decisions when it comes to managing peatlands - targeting restoration efforts to the most degraded peat and identifying the best opportunities for nature recovery"".

Northern Ireland has second-sunniest April on record,"Sunshine hours were well above the average for the time of year, with 215.7 hours of sun throughout April.",1 May 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2wz455l1no,"Northern Ireland has recorded its second-sunniest April on record, with sunshine hours well above the average for the time of year.
According to the Met Office there were 215.7 hours of sun throughout the month, which is 46% more than normal.
The sunniest April on record for Northern Ireland was in 2021 when there were 216.2 hours of sunshine.
While the rest of the UK also recorded above average sunshine, Northern Ireland stood out as being the only area to record more rainfall than expected.
A total of 114% of the average rain fell, largely due to a heavy spell of rain mid-month, sandwiched between periods of stable, high-pressure conditions.
April was also quite a bit warmer than usual with a mean temperature of 9.8C - 1.9C above average - making it the third warmest April on record.
The warmer and sunnier conditions follow a similar story in March when the mean temperature was 1.5C above normal, and there was 13% more sunshine than usual.
However March was a very dry month with just 31% of normal rainfall recorded.
April ended on a remarkably warm note, as temperatures soared to more than 10C above normal on the 30th, with 24.1C recorded at both Castlederg in County Tyrone and Derrylin in County Fermanagh.
That was the warmest April day on record since 1984, with the average temperature for the month being just 12C.
On the same day, the Republic of Ireland provisionally had its warmest April day on record as thermometers climbed to 25.9C in Athenry in County Mayo.
The previous record was 25.8C recorded in County Donegal in 1984.
According to Climate Central - a United States based non-profit - Wednesday's high temperatures were made at least two to three times more likely by climate change and, for some, at least four to five times more likely."
Warmest April day in NI for 40 years,The 24.1C recorded is just shy of the April record of 24.5C set at Boom Hall in Londonderry.,30 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xgv4p27no,"Long-standing temperature records in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were passed on Wednesday.
Temperatures climbed to 24.1C in Castlederg in County Tyrone and Derrylin in County Fermanagh, the warmest April day in Northern Ireland for more than 40 years.
The last time thermometers were that high was 27 April 1984 at Knockraven in County Fermanagh.
In the Republic it was the warmest April day on record at 25.9C in Athenry, County Galway, breaking a 41-year record set back in 1984.

Northern Ireland's April record was not quite passed, with the 24.1C in Castlederg and Derrylin shy of the 24.5C set at Boom Hall in Londonderry on 26 April 1984.
Responding to a question by Alliance assembly member John Blair on Wednesday, Northern Ireland Health Minister Mike Nesbitt said that ""rising temperatures caused by climate change has been recognised as a public health concern"".
He cited the World Health Organisation (WHO) which states ""climate change presents a threat to public health and is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues"".
According to Climate Central, a United States-based non-profit, Wednesday's high temperatures have been made at least 2-3 times more likely by climate change and, for some, at least 4-5 times more likely.
According to Irish weather service, Met Éireann, it is only the second time in Irish climate records that temperatures have risen above 25C in the month of April.
Records in the Republic go back to 1941.
More than 15 Met Éireann weather stations broke their own April high temperature record on Wednesday.
Many across Northern Ireland took advantage of the sunshine and blue skies by heading to well known walking and beauty spots.
The RNLI reminded anyone entering the water to take extra care and avoid unnecessary risks as early season conditions are more challenging.
""Although the outside temperature is really nice and warm, the sea temperature at the minute is still below 10 degrees, so if you are going into the water be very cautious about the period of time that you're in it, Derek Rea from the lifeboat station in Larne said.
""Go into the sea, come out and run up and down the beach, enjoy yourselves and go back in again.""
He said despite the nice weather, low sea temperatures could cause cold water shock.
""If you get into trouble and feel yourself cramping up or anything, what we recommend is you go into the float-to-live approach,"" he said.
""Put your arms out, tilt your head back to open your airway, have the water covering your ears, and your body will naturally come up to the surface."""
Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground,Climate activists may be going deeper underground.,25 Apr 2025,BBC InDepth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6denxzweeo,"Listen to Justin read this article
Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers — a routine they have gone through many a time before.
It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads – for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.
They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.
However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.
In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, ""hanging up the hi-viz"" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.
The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.
Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a ""joyful celebration"".
""We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,"" she says.
The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost £20m.
But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?
JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable – they had to wait around to get arrested.
For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.
The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the ""eco-loons"", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.
The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing ""serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity"" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.
The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including ""locking on"" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.
At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a ""lawful excuse"" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the ""beliefs and motivation"" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.
""We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,"" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.
David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously ""favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.""
The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.
Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have ""had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe"".
In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability – they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.
Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.
I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.
""It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,"" the spokesperson told me. ""Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.""
I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.
This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.
The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.
He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.
""There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,"" he says.
Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance – implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO – against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.
The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they ""arrest"" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.
The group claims to have ""arrested"" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, ""disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,"" she says.
These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.
Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.
But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.
""It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,"" he tells me.
""Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.""
Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.
Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.
But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.
According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.
There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.
Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.
""Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,"" says Read, ""but that's not the same thing as getting real change."" They generated a lot of headlines: ""[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.""
John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.
But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. ""I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,"" he says.
His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.
XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. ""If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,"" he says.
He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.
""The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,"" explains Read.
Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes ""empowering"" voters should be the focus. ""We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk […] truth to power.""
But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. ""If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest […] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.""
He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.
Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage ""they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.""
But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. ""We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,"" says Packham.
It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. ""The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,"" she says. ""Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.""
However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.

Quarry decision 'failed to assess climate effects',Lawyers say the council failed to assess the climate impacts of the proposed Northumberland quarry.,2 Apr 2025,Tyne,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyw492v8vgo,"Plans to build a quarry are in doubt after a council conceded to a legal challenge over how it assessed its possible impact on the environment.
Last year, Northumberland County Council approved a proposal to excavate dolerite - used to produce concrete - near Kirkwhelpington, which would see almost three million tonnes of material extracted over 20 years.
Law firm Leigh Day said the authority agreed to concede to a claim it ""failed to assess the likely climate effects of the development"" relating to soil disturbance, meaning the grant of planning permission could be quashed.
The local authority declined to comment.
Those behind the quarry said it would create 20 long-term jobs.
At the time, dozens of locals opposed saying the wind would blow noise, debris and grime into the village of Kirkwhelpington.
The proposals were approved in November.
Campaigner John Winslow, represented by Leigh Day and supported by the Environmental Law Foundation, challenged the application in February.
As a result, the council told Leigh Day it would concede that it did not comply with its obligations under the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 by failing to assess the likely climate effects of the application.
Ricardo Gama, from Leigh Day, said: ""The council will now need to assess those impacts and reconsider its decision to grant planning permission.""
Leigh Day said it was unlikely the legal challenge would be heard in court because of the concession.
The developers North East Concrete have been approached from comment.

"Region to get 10,000 new electric vehicle chargers",The West Midlands' mayor says the move will help to reduce pollution and tackle climate change.,30 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2vmkv7ke1o,"Ten thousand new charging points for electric vehicles are to be installed in the West Midlands, the region's mayor has said.
Mayor Richard Parker said the move would help with ""reducing pollution and tackling the climate emergency head-on"".
He added that the West Midlands was ""the beating heart of the UK car industry"" and it should be at the forefront of ""a new era of electrification"".
The West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), which is led by Parker, said there were currently more than 4,000 publicly accessible charging points on the region's road network.
The WMCA covers 18 councils in the West Midlands, including city councils in Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton.
The combined authority said it would work with local councils to install the new chargers within a maximum timeframe of four years.
The initiative is due to include almost 200 charging points at nine ultra-fast filling stations, where drivers can charge their vehicles with up to 100 miles of range in less than 15 minutes.
The WMCA said the mayor had secured part of the funding for the initiative from the national government's fund for local electric vehicle infrastructure.
It added that the West Midlands currently had the fifth highest number of charging points in all English regions outside London.
Parker said earlier this month that the region was ""leading the way"" on green public transport, after a fleet of new electric double decker buses was unveiled.
National Express West Midlands now operates 329 electric buses in the region, about a quarter of the fleet.

How could peatlands fall victim to climate change?,"Conditions are set to become ""too hot and too dry"" for carbon-storing peat to form, research shows.",3 Apr 2025,Devon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c897dg8xnd8o,"Healthy peat is the country's biggest carbon store but when damaged it releases planet-warming greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere. New research shows instead of being part of the answer to climate change, peat bogs could become a victim of it.
Peat is formed over thousands of years from partially decayed plants in waterlogged conditions. Its ability to absorb and store carbon dioxide means peatlands are key to the UK's ambition of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
However, our peatlands are under a two-pronged attack - from the past and from the future.
Historic damage caused by human activities like farming, forestry and peat cutting has left 87% of England's peatlands degraded and dried out, emitting tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, according to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
On Dartmoor, the University of Exeter estimates just 1% of its deep peat is healthy, peat-forming bog.
Efforts to restore this vital natural resource are under way, including in Exmoor, Dartmoor and Cornwall, but scientists are warning climate change could make that difficult.
""Under even the least severe climate change scenario, most peatlands move outside of their preferred climate,"" lead researcher, ecology professor Dan Bebber says.
""Too hot, too dry, that's the prediction for the future.""
Prof Bebber worked with scientists from three other universities to compare the ideal climatic conditions for healthy peat-forming bog in the UK with three climate change projections for low, moderate and high emissions scenarios.
The research focusses on Dartmoor, the Peak District, Snowdonia and the Flow Country in north-east Scotland, the newly designated Unesco World Heritage site.
However, Prof Bebber says the results apply to all of the UK.
They conclude that even under the lowest emissions scenario, which they say ""would require very rapid decarbonisation"", the decrease in the probability of peat presence is ""severe"".
The study adds Dartmoor is projected to lose 68% to 100% of its suitable area for peat formation by 2061 to 2080.
Under the highest emissions scenario, they say the climate that peat is likely to be found in ""will have virtually disappeared"" by that timeframe ""for all of our case study areas except Snowdonia"".
""What's going to happen is the climate's going to become warmer, so the summers will get a lot hotter and generally there'll be less rainfall throughout the year,"" Prof Bebber says.
""Those are conditions that are not particularly great for peat.""
The UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology says peatlands occupy about 12% of the UK's land area, storing an estimated 3.2 billion tonnes of carbon.
That is more than the combined forests of Britain, France and Germany, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The study says more research is needed on what might happen to these peatlands once they are outside their preferred climate.
In the paper, the scientists call for more restoration of peatlands across the UK ""to limit the impact of future drought conditions"", but they add ""being outside the current bioclimatic envelope may make full restoration challenging"".
Angela Gallego-Sala, a professor of biochemistry who co-wrote the research, says peatlands are likely to become ""stressed"" but they are resilient systems that might be able to adapt.
""We don't know what might happen [but] if we restore them, we know that we are giving them the best chance of persisting in time... We know that if we do nothing, these systems that are very dry, will definitely end up losing a lot of carbon into the atmosphere,"" she says.
Restoration work is being carried out all over the country.
In England, which has 1.4 million hectares of peatlands, Natural England and Defra is currently funding 23 projects through the Nature for Climate Peatland Grant Scheme, with an ambition to restore hundreds of thousands of hectares of peatlands.
The South West Peat Partnership (SWPP), one group which has received funding, is aiming to restore more than 2,600 hectares of damaged peatland across Exmoor, Dartmoor and Cornwall.
To be healthy peat bogs must be wet.
SWPP teams have been raising the water table in areas of drained and degraded peatland, by blocking the drainage gullies which are both man-made and caused by erosion.
Project officer George Kohler says climate change is already having an impact on the work.
He says: ""We're building [the blocks] a bit higher and a bit sturdier so we can withstand that rain as well as hold as much water as possible and that hopefully will just try and mitigate against any drying that we might face with climate change.""
Restoration manager Morag Angus says the new research shows restoration needs to happen faster and ""at a much bigger scale"" to get them in the best possible condition to face the coming threat.
She says peatlands in the South West are ""in a degrading state"" and are being lost.
""When you look at a river, if you're stood on Exmoor, Dartmoor, or Bodmin moor... you'll see that it's a brown colour, like tea colour.
""That's the peat that's been lost from the top of the moorlands entering into those rivers.""
SWPP's projects have funding until 2030 – but they say more cash and support is needed.
""We've got this huge responsibility for us as a society and locally in the South West to do what we can do to restore those peatlands,"" Ms Angus says.
""So that we can... protect these peatlands and make them work better for now and for future generations in order to combat that climate change, biodiversity crisis that we've got.""
A Defra spokesperson says England's peatlands are of ""huge international importance"".
""Healthy peatlands provide multiple environmental benefits; they store carbon, optimise biodiversity, are more resilient to wildfire and can help to alleviate flooding and improve water quality,"" they say.
""It is vital that we protect these sites for future generations and that's why this government is investing £400m to protect and restore nature, including for our peatlands.""

"Chip-shop fish key to seabed health, study finds",The Convex Seascape Survey finds the Atlantic cod is one of many species to have been overfished.,29 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyql951g0wo,"Many of the fish we eat play a key role in maintaining the seabed and therefore our climate, according to new research by the University of Exeter.
Scientists working on the Convex Seascape Survey focussed on the role of fish in bioturbation, the process of churning the seabed to keep it healthy and fertile, in shallow UK seas.
The Atlantic cod, a staple in chip shops, jointly topped the list of these important ""ecosystem engineers"", along with Atlantic hagfish and European eel.
In total, 185 fish species were found to play a role in bioturbation, and 120 of these are targeted by commercial fishing.
""Ocean sediments are the world's largest reservoir of organic carbon, so what happens on the seabed matters for our climate,"" said Mara Fisher, a University of Exeter PhD student, who led the study.
""Bioturbation is very important for how the seabed takes up and stores organic carbon, so the process is vital to our understanding of how the ocean absorbs greenhouse gases to slow the rate of climate change.
""Our study is the first to attempt to quantify the bioturbation impact of fish, and it shows they play a significant, widespread role.""
Prof Callum Roberts, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter's Penryn Campus in Cornwall, said: ""We found that species with the highest bioturbation impacts are among the most vulnerable to threats like commercial fishing.
""Many of the largest and most powerful diggers and disturbers of seabed sediments, like giant skates, halibut and cod, have been so overfished they have all but vanished from our seas.
""These losses translate into big, but still uncertain, changes in the way seabed ecosystems work.""
The Convex Seascape Survey is a five-year partnership between Blue Marine Foundation, the University of Exeter and Convex Group Limited, and aims to build a greater understanding of the ocean in attempts to slow climate change.

Dry weather threatens 'exceptionally low' rivers in parts of UK,The warning comes after some parts of the UK had the driest Spring in nearly a century.,48 mins ago,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmkn7rjv7zo,"Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses.
The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century.
Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.
The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.
The next 2-3 weeks will be ""crucial"" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.
That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.
The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.
Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.
""We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,"" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.
He had to start irrigating his fields in March.
""We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,"" he said.
He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported.
The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.
The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.
Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.
That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.
However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.
But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does ""potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,"" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.
At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be.
There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.
Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.
Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.
By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.
Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.
If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.
In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.
Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.
Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.
And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.
Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than £1m.
It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.
But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.
A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.
He added: ""Over £104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.""
The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck.
Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change.
Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally.
Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer.
That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office.

Lowest rainfall in 90 years as temperatures set to soar,"In February, March and April, just 78mm (3in) of rain fell across the region, the lowest since 1938.",30 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxg8lqxyggo,"As Yorkshire prepares for what is expected to be the hottest day of the year so far, records show the region has endured its driest combined February, March and April for almost 90 years.
Just 78mm (3in) of rainfall has been recorded at Sheffield's Weston Park weather station since the start of February - the lowest since 1938.
Typically we would expect to see around 184mm (7in) and, by contrast, the same period in 2024 was the sixth wettest on record, when 300mm (11.8in) fell.
Temperatures could reach as high as 26C (79F) later - the average for late April is 14C (57F) - and though they are expected to fall later in the week there is little, if any, rain in the forecast as we head into May.
But, while the warm weather may be a boon to sunbathers and holidaymakers alike, it's not universally welcomed.
Take Dr Nick Wilson, an arable farmer in the Vale of York, who specialises in crops such as wheat and barley
He said he had only recorded 20mm (0.7in) of rain at his farm in the last 10 weeks. The contrast with last year when his crops were sitting in flooded fields couldn't be more stark.
""It's a crucial time of the year for the development of crops,"" he tells me.
""And with the lack of rainfall we are already looking at a 15% drop in crop yield.
""More worryingly, if we don't get any rain in the next week or 10 days, the yield could drop to potentially more than 20%.""

Inevitably, this is likely to mean higher prices in the shops later in the year.
And farmers like Nick haven't recovered from the disastrous spring floods last year, which lead to another poor UK harvest
""We've been hit from every side at the moment, whether it's politically, economically or financially,"" he says.
""And this could just be another nail in that proverbial coffin. It's not good and farmers' mental health is really suffering.""
Jim McQuaid, from the Department for Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, tells me no-one should be surprised by these increasingly frequent weather extremes.
In recent years we have seen numerous records broken in the UK - the most notable one in July 2022 when 40C was recorded for the first time  - a temperature which scientists believed would have been impossible were it not for climate change.
""This is what the weather models have been telling us for a number of years, but now we're actually seeing it with our own eyes,"" Dr McQuaid says.
And there's evidence to suggest that the jet stream - so crucial in determining weather in the UK - is being impacted by our warming planet, leading to longer periods of the same weather.
It's a ribbon of fast-moving air high up in the atmosphere, formed by the clash between cold air in the Arctic and the much warmer air in the sub-tropics.
But the Arctic is becoming less cold - it is the fastest warming place on earth – and this is weakening the temperature contrast with the sub-tropics, which is so crucial in determining the strength of the jet stream.
This may be causing the jet stream to meander in the Atlantic - becoming slower-moving and so becoming stuck – leading to longer periods of either rainfall like we saw last spring or dry weather that we have seen since February.
And for farmers like Nick, who are desperate for some rainfall, the long range forecast doesn't offer much in the way of hope, with the first half of May expected to see a continuation of the drought.
I've been a meteorologist for 30 years, and there can be no doubt we are seeing patterns of weather becoming more extreme, not just the intensity of events, such as more rainfall, but the length of time these types of weather last.
The flooded fields with crops under water last year and the same fields this year with crops struggling to survive the drought illustrates our changing climate, with projections suggesting these patterns are only likely to become more extreme over time.

CO2 capture project hopes to bring 'quality' jobs,Direct carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it away.,2 May 2025,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg70g14qjvo,"A company behind one of the UK's first carbon capture projects hopes to provide ""high quality green jobs"" in the region.
Mission Zero's direct air capture plant at Wretham in Norfolk will remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and use it to create limestone building materials.
""We're demonstrating one of the pioneering processes of the future in an area you wouldn't normally associate with it,"" said Nicholas Chadwick, co-founder of Mission Zero.
O.C.O. Technology, which produces the limestone aggregate, said: ""A significant number of construction projects in the locality are going to have a lower carbon footprint"".
O.C.O. is already up and running in Wretham, turning fly ash or slag into ""sustainable aggregate"" for use in roads and buildings.
It previously had to import manufactured CO2, but will now also be able to use the gas captured on site by the Mission Zero system, which the two companies claim is a world first.
Direct carbon capture is seen as one of the solutions to climate change, as it removes CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it away. Levels of CO2 have risen by 40% since 1900 and are causing the planet to warm rapidly, along with other heat-trapping gases like methane.
Graham Cooper, managing director of O.C.O Technology, said: ""Direct air capture is so necessary to reaching net zero and reducing carbon in the atmosphere"".
He said it was ""important that people can feel their region is contributing to moving things forward"".
Dr Chadwick said it was important for people with the relevant skills from other industries to become part of the ""green transition"".
""These are high quality, complex jobs. Come and use your skills to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere,"" he said.
He added that Mission Zero was about ""redefining humanity's relationship with carbon"".
""Carbon has made the world good, it's provided everything we've needed – it's just where we get the carbon from is the issue.
""Usually it's from an unsustainable source: fossil fuels. But CO2 from the atmosphere can be used to displace that,"" he said.
Dr Chadwick is not daunted by the scale of the task.
The UK emitted an estimated 406.2 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2022, whereas Mission Zero's plant is able to remove 250 tonnes of CO2 per year.
""It's a real working chemical plant sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere and locking it away so it can't warm the planet again.
""You need to prove the tech, scale it, make it cheap.
""The 2020s is about demonstrating this is real, not a magic far-flung thing that could happen in decades to come,"" he said.

Australia: A guide to election day,It's a close race between Albanese and Dutton - here's what you need to know going into election day.,2 May 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp91lyp1e8lo,"After weeks of campaigning, Australia's 2025 federal election is here - and its looking to be a tight race between the incumbent Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton.
If you're planning on staying up late to watch the results roll in tonight, here's a quick look at what you need to know.
The two main candidates for the prime minister's seat are the current premier Anthony Albanese and his opposition rival Peter Dutton.
Albanese, who heads the Labor party, enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power but in recent years has come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.
Dutton, who is head of the Liberal-National coalition, is known as a staunch conservative and has experience holding important ministerial portfolios, like defence and home affairs. However, he has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.
There are also the left-leaning Greens, Australia's third largest political party, as well as a wave of ""Teal candidates"" - independent candidates who have been running on a strong climate platform.
Wherever you are in Australia, polls close at 18:00 - but the country's three different time zones means there isn't one standard time where all polls shut.
The eastern states of Australia - New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland which follow Australian Eastern Standard Time - will be among the first places to close at 18:00 local time, or 08:00 GMT.
Next will come South Australia, as well as the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, followed by the state of Western Australia.
The last polling booths - in the ting, far-flung Australian territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands - will close 12.30 GMT.
Unlike most countries including the US and UK, exit polls aren't big in Australia, mostly because early voting - which opens two weeks before the election - is common, and because polling stations across the country close at different times.
But counting in each state begins straight after polls close. Results are updated in real time on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website - in what is known as an unofficial preliminary count, with Australians typically getting an unofficial result the same night.
The AEC also provides what's known as an ""indicative count"", which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.
This sees counting officers conduct what is called a two-candidate-preferred count between the two leading candidates in each electoral district. This gives citizens a quick indication of who could form the government.
Australian pollsters also have a good track record of picking political winners, with a 96% success rate between 2007 and 2016, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The exception was in 2019, when polls showed Labor to be ahead - but the election was won by then Coalition prime minister Scott Morrison.
It is usually days or weeks before an official result is released by the AEC as they have to go through a rigorous counting process, tallying approximately 18 million ballot papers by hand, including postal and overseas ballot papers.
But citizens usually look to media outlets and election experts - like Australia's national broadcaster ABC - to call the unofficial results on election night.
In the last election in 2022, the ABC announced the results at 21:30 - just three and a half hours after polls closed on the east coast.
And as the night goes on, parties also come out to declare their win - or loss - so it might play out in the form of a victory speech, or in one conceding defeat.
There is no one specific time when the results are called, but 2022 gives a sense of how quickly we might be able see a winner. However if it proves to be a tight race, this process could take quite a while longer.
In the case of a hung parliament, it might take days or weeks before a result is called. In 2010, which is the last time Australia had a hung parliament, it took 17 days of post-election negotiations for a government to be formed - with both the Labor Party and the Coalition vying to win the support of six crossbenchers.  In the end, Labor was able to form a minority government.
So depending on the scenario that plays out, Australians might have to hang on to their edge of their seats for a while longer before an official result emerges."
Miliband urges global cooperation amid energy 'challenges',The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.,24 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8kr8k28z2o,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.
He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.
Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being ""weaponised"", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.
Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.
In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.
He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.
The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased ""international fragmentation"" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.
""Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.""
He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.
Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.
Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.
The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a ""success"" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.
Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.
""On the big calls – like the future of global oil demand – the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation
""As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,"" he added.
Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.
""As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,"" King Charles wrote.
The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.
Miliband told the BBC's R4 Today programme that this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.

Residents celebrate gas-fired power plant refusal,Inspector rejects plans due to concern over its effects on nearby residents and ecology.,3 May 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w8z5k7q79o,"Plans for a gas-fired power plant have been rejected by a planning inspector.
Welsh government ministers appointed an inspector to consider the application at the former Seiont Brickworks, near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, as it was deemed a development of ""national significance"".
A final report published on Friday said the plans were rejected amid concerns it ""would result in harm to the living conditions of nearby occupiers, in relation to noise and, due to air quality, ecology"".
Local campaigners Caernarfon Lân welcomed the ruling.
Developer Jones Bros, based in Ruthin, Denbighshire, previously said its scheme would contribute power to the National Grid, creating up to 15 new jobs, and support more indirect work locally.
But residents raised concerns over air, noise and traffic pollution, as well as the environmental impact, with the site close to homes, a park and hospital.
In the report, inspector Claire MacFarlane said the ""main benefit of the proposal would be in contributing to a reliable supply of electricity"" and that the application ""would be acceptable with regard to climate change planning policies"".
However, the ""limited economic benefits attract minimal weight in favour of the application"".
""In balancing these issues, I find that the harm associated with the proposal, specifically in relation to living conditions and air quality, are compelling factors that outweigh the benefits of the development.""
Caernarfon Lân said the ruling marked ""great day for Caernarfon and for our local environment"", in a post on its Facebook page."
Council to end lease of erosion-threatened car park,The site at Lossiemouth West Beach is expected to be regularly under water by the end of the century.,2 May 2025,"NE, Orkney & Shetland",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjlq2v3e6zo,"A local authority has decided not to renew its lease of a car park at a popular Moray beach due to the impact of climate change.
Moray Council said it was making the decision over the site at Lossiemouth West Beach due to rising sea levels and coastal erosion.
Experts expect the car park to be regularly under water by the end of the century and protecting it would cost about £750,000.
The council said its capital spending was limited to key areas like schools.
The council lease from Spynie Farms expires in January 2027 and it said technical assessments had confirmed that the site was increasingly at risk from coastal erosion, flooding and sea level rise.
By 2050, it is projected that the site will fall within the area of active coastal erosion, and by the end of the century, it is expected to be below the mean high water spring tide level.
The car park is sandwiched between Moray Golf Club and the Moray Firth shoreline.
The nearest public alternatives are several minutes' walk away on the other side of Lossiemouth town centre.
Marc Macrae, who chairs the council's economic development committee, said it fully acknowledged how valued the car park was by local residents, businesses and visitors.
He said talks would continue with groups including the Lossiemouth Community Development Trust, Lossiemouth Community Council and Moray Golf Club to find a way forward.
The community council said it was ""utterly dismayed"" by the news.
""This beach and car park are essential to our community, locals and visitors alike,"" it said.
""We will be meeting with Moray Council, elected members and other groups as a matter of urgency in the coming days."".
Chloe Sim took over The Beach Hut café near the site a few weeks ago.
""I was quite shocked that we had heard it from Facebook and not the council themselves,"" she said.
""We had no warning, no word, nothing - it was horrible.""
She said she felt it would have a big impact on business and the wider area.
""Once that car park is gone it is going to get drastically worse,"" she said.
""I think they are really going to struggle to come down here and it is really going to affect the community.""
Rising sea levels and increased intensity of storms are already having a damaging effect on Scotland's coastline.
Dozens of golf courses have reported impacts from coastal erosion while the important Neolithic village of Skara Brae in Orkney has been described as ""extremely vulnerable.""
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) says sea levels in Scotland have been rising by an average of 1.4 mm per year this century.
They have published updated maps showing large areas of coastal land which will now be vulnerable to flooding by 2080.
That includes the West Beach car park which has a ""medium likelihood"" of flooding."
Free city centre parking for green vehicles to end,Sheffield councillors say the scheme is no longer sustainable due to a surge in low-emission cars.,1 May 2025,South Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly54v4d4n9o,"Permits that allow drivers of low-emission vehicles to park for free in Sheffield city centre are to be scrapped.
Sheffield City Council's transport, regeneration and climate policy committee agreed on Wednesday to end green parking permits on 31 July, with existing permits not being renewed beyond that date.
The committee heard electric and ultra low-emission vehicles had increased significantly on roads since the permits were introduced nearly 20 years ago.
Councillors agreed the volume of permits had become ""completely unsustainable"" and noted that many drivers were using the permits for all-day commuter parking, restricting the availability for others.
The scheme was introduced in 2005 to encourage drivers to switch to cleaner vehicles, supporting the city's efforts to improve air quality.
Under the scheme, eligible ultra low-emission vehicles (ULEVs) were granted free parking in council-run on and off-street pay-and-display bays in the city centre.
A council report noted that since 2018, applications for permits had surged, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
In the last financial year (2024/25), 5,802 unique permits were issued—up from 1,904 in 2023/24 and 1,644 in 2022/23.
The committee was recommended to contribute to the development of an investment plan to ensure that any surplus income generated from parking was reinvested appropriately.
It was requested that as part of this plan £125,000 should be set aside to support the transition to zero-emission vehicles, with funding directed towards investment in public charging infrastructure.
In February 2019, Sheffield City Council declared a climate emergency and is currently working towards Sheffield becoming a zero-carbon city by the start of the next decade.

Great time to invest in rugby - Newcastle's Diamond,Newcastle Falcons consultant director of rugby Steve Diamond says big companies should be interested in investing in rugby union.,23 hrs ago,Newcastle,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cx2jwwlxl1ko,"Steve Diamond has been in charge of Newcastle Falcons since January 2024
Newcastle Falcons consultant director of rugby Steve Diamond said the the climate has improved for investment in club rugby.
A new five-year TV deal has been signed to broadcast Premiership matches until the end of the 2030-31 season.
While Bristol Bears and Harlequins took league matches to the Principality Stadium and Allianz Stadium on Saturday leading to healthy attendances and potential new audiences.
""It is obviously a good time for businesses to invest in the league,"" Diamond said.
""There were two games with 100,000 people watching club rugby, they've just done a new TV deal, so I think it's about time big organisations and investors looked at rugby.""
A crowd of 51,095 attended Bristol v Bath at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Saturday
Newcastle, who prop up the Premiership with two wins from 16 league games, have been looking for new investment since November with owner Semore Kurdi wanting out.
An article linked, external the north-east club with interest from energy drink giant Red Bull, the company which has a strong sports portfolio in football and Formula 1 amongst others already.
Diamond said he has heard nothing about this, but he is more optimistic about the future.
He also cited the report , externalwhich showed that a more youthful audience was being attracted to Premiership rugby as another way of bringing in much-needed new money.
""I have nothing to say about Red Bull,"" Diamond added.
""But big multi-national companies would look to invest in what they see is a growing sport.
""We've got 15 British and Irish Lions coming out of the Premiership. The league is looking good, we just need the right sort of investors.
""One of the interesting stats for me that came out was an increase in people between 18 to 34 watching rugby.
""I'm pretty sure for a company like Red Bull or something similar, that is the demographic they are targeting.""

Cash for tourist firms to shelter visitors from rain,"Tourism businesses could claim up to £20k from the Welsh government to invest in ""weather-proofing"".",30 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z1v2kyy6o,"Tourist attractions in Wales could claim up to £20,000 of grant funding from the Welsh government to invest in ""weather-proofing"".
The government said the scheme would help small or medium-sized businesses to invest in measures like canopies, improved car park surfaces or visitor shelters, as weather conditions become increasingly unpredictable.
Data from Visit Wales showed 55% of businesses said poor weather was a reason for fewer visitors last summer.
But a Bangor University economist questioned whether the £1m scheme would be enough to have an impact on the industry.
Tourism brings £3.8bn to the Welsh economy each year, according to the Welsh government.
The weather-proofing scheme will run until 2026 and offer grants of between £5,000 and £20,000.
Eligible businesses must be accredited visitor attractions under the Visitor Attraction Quality Assurance Scheme; be micro, small or medium-sized; and have been trading for at least one year as a limited company, partnership, sole trader or social enterprise.
Dan yr Ogof, a 17km (10 mile) cave system in Swansea which attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year, hopes to apply for the grant.
Ashford Price, chairman of the attraction, said he would use the money to build more shelters by the ticket office and at stations for the site's land train.
""No umbrella in this world would weather-proof Wales,"" admitted Mr Price.
But he hopes to find a way to help visitors enjoy the landscape without getting soaked.
""The serious side is that when they're at an attraction they're paying a lot of money to see what is there,"" he said.
""The important thing is Wales is doing something where the other regions are doing nothing.
""If they know there's a kind of assurance that we've done our very best to look after them, even in the rain, I think that will get us some brownie points.""
He said he would like to see more money made available in the future but described the grant as ""a good starting point"".
Andy Addis-Fuller from the Penycae Inn restaurant, in Swansea, said he hoped the business would also receive a grant.
""With the climate the way it is and the downpours that we get, we need to start thinking outside the box with regards to what we do to keep people dry,"" he said.
The team also runs a ""micro zoo"", has a separate building with rooms for staying guests and outdoor space for eating and drinking.
""People like to use the space outside, it's a lovely space but if it really does start to beat down they've got nowhere to go, literally stood there thinking 'we're getting wet',"" said Mr Addis-Fuller.
He said they would use the funding to invest in more pergolas for the outdoor seating area or even a marquee. They would also look to invest in more heaters and heated rails, to benefit the walkers who visit.
""Really in the last six months we've had quite a few storms which have really impacted the valley,"" said Mr Addis-Fuller.
Dr Edward Thomas Jones, senior lecturer in economics at Bangor University said tourism ""really contributes to economies in many areas"" of Wales.
""One of the issues that we hear a lot here is the impact that wet weather or any bad weather has on businesses,"" he added.
""The concerns that I have is that the £1m fund that we're talking about, that won't be sufficient to really have an impact on this industry.""
The cabinet secretary with responsibility for tourism, Rebecca Evans, said the fund was a result of listening to ""the concerns of people working in the tourism attraction sector"".
""As the weather, which has carved out our impressive landscapes throughout history, becomes more and more unpredictable, it has been identified as the single biggest factor affecting visitor numbers to Welsh attractions,"" said Ms Evans.
She said the fund would help businesses to ""prepare for increasingly variable weather patterns"" as well as extending the tourist season."
What is life like in the shadow of solar farms?,Residents of Ashby-de-la-Zouch offer mixed views on the fields of solar panels surrounding the town.,6 May 2025,Leicestershire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ew0rv3d28o,"Plans to turn land being used for the production of food into farms harvesting the power of the sun often see campaigns fought through the planning process.
For some these glimmering, undulating landscapes of panels are now as much a part of the countryside as the fields they inhabit, but for others, the feeling is they are totally at odds with it.
Heading out of the Leicestershire market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch on almost any of its roads, once you pass a handful of entrances to housing estates of varying ages, you arrive in the National Forest countryside.
On a sunny spring morning, it is a glorious place to be.
But around Ashby these open spaces are not a green wedge, so much as a buffer of fields covered in panels harvesting green energy.
Walking along the roadside in Shellbrook, on the western edge of the town, the chirpy song of chiffchaffs, blackcaps and robins in the hedgerows now mixes with the buzz of kit working away inside the green metal boxes behind the chain link fencing beyond them.
One homeowner nearby said they had not objected but were now living with the hum of the solar farm nearby, while one man living near to Ashby's biggest collection of panels, who did not wish to be named, told me all solar farms ""need a bomb putting under them"".
He fumed that having one on his doorstep had devalued his property, and that acres upon acres of ""valuable farmland"" were lost to the scheme.
These are arguments routinely put to planning officers and council committees the length and breadth of the country - that these renewable schemes lead to the loss of productive farmland, and come at a cost to the look of the landscape.
These battles are fought increasingly regularly, some are won by developers, and some are lost. But when the dust settles and one is built, what is it really like?
For more of the Ashby residents I spoke to, where the panels were mostly put in about a decade ago, there are drawbacks, despite most people having much less incendiary views on the solar farms next door.
But the overall consensus was - they do not really bother them.
John Gillespie, 41, said the solar panels a stone's throw from his house were not flagged when he bought his home recently, and having them nearby had not affected him.
He said: ""As the population grows, we need more energy. There's a lot of empty fields, I don't think it's harming anyone.""
Shellbrook resident Liz Bark, 54, said: ""When they built it we were concerned what it could look like, but it's fine.
""When you walk around the wooded area you can hear it but it doesn't bother us at home.
""It's quite nice to see that the ground is still being used. The grass is still growing, the sheep are being fed.""
Sarah Pay, 70, of Ashby, has banks of panels just beyond her garden fence, but said: ""We are sort of relieved because it's not housing.
""What I can't understand is why don't put them on roofs. In France you see them on top of car parks and industrial units, they put them on all the unsightly things, they haven't stuck them all over the countryside.
""We're missing a trick here.""
Her view was echoed by neighbour Kevin Holloway, 66, who said: ""You've got all those warehouses at Castle Donington, not one has got solar panels on them.""
He added really it was up to the farmer what to do with their land.
""If they can't make enough growing food, then they're going to do something else,"" he said.
That was just what Ingles Hill Farm in Smisby did 10 years ago.
Farmer Maurice Stanley, now 79, was at retirement age and was made an offer by a renewables firm.
He said: ""You can use it for agricultural use, to graze sheep on it for instance, but I chose not to - I've got enough to keep me going at my age.
""I could have put more in but I wanted to keep the view from the road as arable land, I didn't want panels right up to the road.
""There were no objections, and I haven't had any since.""
Mr Stanley said intervening years have backed his decision.
He said: ""I'm not a Green but I do think we've got to get as much green energy as we can, for obvious reasons.
""There's no doubt about it, global warming is a fact. We've just gone through two months without an inch of rain and as a result crops are really suffering - before that it didn't stop raining for 18 months.
""With climate change, we need to do all we can.
""Solar panels are an excellent way of producing energy, and it provides a better income than farming, otherwise we wouldn't do it.""
The BBC approached firms behind some of Ashby's solar farms about their impact on the town.
Mike Rutgers, managing director UK development at Low Carbon, which operates the largest of the solar sites in Ashby, said: ""We find communities are more and more accepting of thoughtfully conceived solar development as concerns over climate change grow.""
He said the farms not only provided ""affordable clean energy"", they helped to keep farms viable by providing ""a stable revenue stream"".
He said: ""We believe that the dual missions of energy security and food security are complementary.""
He added: ""We recognise the important role roof-mounted solar can play in helping to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and cut energy bills.
""However, without utility-solar projects we will not be able to meet the UK's target of trebling solar capacity by 2030.""
Hadstone Energy, the firm behind the solar site near Lount, to the east of Ashby, said ""lots of thought"" was put into making its site ""acceptable to the local community"".
A larger farm had been planned but ""a rare lizard habitat"" was nearby so plans were scaled down.
Director James Rowe said: ""We had a public consultation event in Ashby, which was very pleasant and from which no issues arose. I don't think there were any written objections and I went to the council meeting, in which it was dealt with very quickly and without objections.""
The government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that solar was ""at the heart"" of work to generate green energy.
A spokesperson said: ""As of September last year, solar farms covered around 0.1% of the total land area of the UK, while bringing huge benefits for the British public and our energy security.
""Projects are subject to a rigorous planning process, in which the views and interests of the local community and impacts on the local environment, including any impact on amenities, landscapes and land use, are considered.""
While solar farms on fields are not set to disappear - especially those already built with lifetimes in their decades - the future of solar may be starting to move up towards the rooftops of the UK.
The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is set to publish new guidance on homebuilding ""later this year"", it said, which would ""maximise the installation of solar panels on new homes"".

Bug splat survey reveals 'alarming' decline,Kent Wildlife Trust's bug splat survey is monitoring the decline in numbers in the UK and Ireland.,3 May 2025,Kent,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v947vlkzgo,"A survey tracking the ""staggering"" decline in insect numbers across the UK and Ireland has begun.
The Bugs Matter survey, led by Kent Wildlife Trust and invertebrate charity Buglife, runs from 1 May to 30 September each year and sees ""citizen scientists"" record the number of bug splats on their vehicle number plates after a journey.
The results from 2024 found the number of flying insect splats recorded across the UK had fallen by 63% since 2021. Ireland was not included in last year's survey but will take part this year.
Dr Lawrence Ball, from Kent Wildlife Trust, said the decline could perhaps be linked to ""the extreme climate in the UK in recent years"".
Insects play a vital role in the ecosystem by pollinating crops, providing natural pest control, decomposing waste and underpinning food chains that support birds, mammals and other wildlife.
Dr Ball said: ""Without insects, the planet's ecological systems would collapse so this huge decrease in insect splats over such a short time is really alarming.""
Bug splats declined 8% in 2024, following sharper drops of 44% in 2023 and 28% in 2022.
Dr Ball said the slowing rate of decline shows the curve may flatten or even reverse next year.
More than 25,000 journeys have been analysed as part of the survey since 2021.

Cash boost to install electric car charging points,More than 20 areas could see points installed from the summer under Kirklees Council plans.,30 Apr 2025,West Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c934593n12vo,"More than 20 areas in Kirklees could see electric vehicle (EV) charging points installed from this summer, thanks to a multi million-pound cash boost.
Under the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) Fund, the region will receive £2.5m from the West Yorkshire Combined Authority to install public charging points by 2027.
Further investment will come from private providers, taking the total earmarked for Kirklees to about £3.8m.
Kirklees Council's cabinet will be asked to accept the funds next week, as it works towards a target of becoming net zero/climate ready by 2038.
The project would be delivered in two phases, with the aim of installing points at the first 23 locations from the summer, using £282,000 of the grant.
Chargers must be installed in three priority locations before the other 20 can be put in, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
These are Spring Wood Street in Huddersfield, New Street Car Park in Honley and Shaw Cross Community Centre in Dewsbury.
EV points would then be installed in Batley, Birstall, Dewsbury, Holmfirth, Huddersfield, Cleckheaton, Heckmondwike, Netherton, Denby Dale, Cowersley, Skelmanthorpe, Emley, Liversedge and Moldgreen.
After this, another phase covering on-street charging points, in areas of terraced houses where parking is tight, would be installed - with their locations to be confirmed and put in by 2026/7.
The council said some parking income from pay-and-display car parks would be lost when the points were installed.
But other income would come from the bays being leased for 15 years, giving the council £130 per standard charging bay, £160 per fast charging bay and £1,200 per rapid charging bay each year - an approximate annual income of £27,700 and £415,500 over 15 years.
At the end of the lease period, the council can either negotiate a further lease, or ask the EV charging providers to remove equipment and ""make good"" on the sites, a report said.
The council said although it did not intend to charge for the use of parking bayS while charging, the authority or EV leaseholders may eventually decide to introduce a payment or require a permit for the bays in future.

What is Earth Day and what has it achieved?,The worldwide event aims to raise awareness about the need to protect the environment.,21 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68610073,"Every year, millions of people across the globe gather to mark Earth Day and celebrate the environmental movement.
The event began in 1970 in the United States, and is now marked around the world.
Earth Day is a global event which aims to highlight the importance of protecting the environment.
It takes place annually on 22 April.
It was set up in 1970 by Gaylord Nelson, a US senator and environmentalist, and Denis Hayes, a graduate student at Harvard University.
Both had growing concerns about environmental damage in the US, such as that caused by a large oil spill in 1969 in Santa Barbara, California.
They came up with Earth Day as a way to engage the public and push green issues to the national agenda.
The first Earth Day saw 20 million people across the US take to the streets.
It became a global event in 1990, and now involves more than one billion people of all ages in nearly 200 countries, according to organisers.
""Celebrating Earth Day is often the first environmental action for a lot of people,"" said Earthday.org president, Kathleen Rogers.
The official theme for 2025, ""Our Power, Our Planet"", focuses on renewable energy.
Previous events have covered a range of environmental issues, including climate change, plastic pollution and species protection.
This year, the organisers are calling for worldwide electricity generation from renewable sources - such as wind and solar - to triple by 2030.
This is similar to a pledge agreed at the COP28 global climate conference in 2023 to triple the capacity of renewables by 2030.
Renewables have been growing quickly, but are slightly off track to meet that promise, the International Energy Agency said in October.
Earth Day sees various local events take place in addition to the official theme, such as clean-ups of beaches, rivers and other spaces.
Within a few years of the first Earth Day in 1970, the US Environmental Protection Agency had been set up, and several environmental laws - such as the Clean Air Act - had been established or significantly strengthened.
More recent events have included planting hundreds of millions of trees, supporting farmers with sustainable agriculture practices, and starting climate literacy projects around the world.
Some observers also cite the importance of Earth Day in pushing environmental issues back up national and international agendas.
""With a host of issues driving our environmental challenges down society's priority list, events like Earth Day remind us of the long-term cost of short-termism,"" said Yvo de Boer, former UN climate chief.
In 2016, Earth Day was symbolically chosen for the official signing of the landmark Paris climate accord, which had been agreed in late 2015.
It was the first time that countries of the world had collectively agreed targets to try to limit global warming.
Some critics warn that these achievements give a false sense of progress.
Many environmental indicators - from global temperatures to species extinctions - are changing rapidly due to human activities. Efforts to date have fallen far short of halting or reversing these trends.
Some individuals and companies have also been accused of using Earth Day as an opportunity to misleadingly promote their environmental credentials, without making the real changes that are needed.
This is known as ""greenwashing"".
For example, campaigner Greta Thunberg posted in 2022 that Earth Day ""has turned into an opportunity for people in power to post their 'love' for the planet, while at the same time destroying it at maximum speed"".
""We all know greenwashing is happening and it is infuriating,"" Earth Day organiser Ms Rogers told BBC News.
""It's not an issue we've caused, but we know Earth Day is used cynically by some businesses to [mis]use the ethos of sustainability for their own gain.""
""Governments need to take robust action and crack down on any business or industry lying to consumers."""
Who are Green Party leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay?,The pair were two of four Green MPs to be elected as last year's general election.,6 days ago,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clww1n8gz3eo,"Age: 39
Education: Durham University
Family: No known partner
Political career: Bristol City Councillor 2015-2024; Parliamentary candidate for Bristol Central
Denyer's political campaigning began when she was in sixth form, getting involved in campaigns to promote fair trade and stop the war in Iraq. She is vegan.
After graduating from Durham University, she used her mechanical engineering qualifications in the renewables sector, specialising in wind energy, before joining the Green Party in 2011.
She describes herself as bisexual or pansexual and was recognised as one of Bristol’s most influential LGBTQ+ people by media website Bristol Live in 2021.
She was first elected to Bristol City Council in 2015, advocating renters’ rights and access to public transport and key services.
In 2018, she wrote Europe's first Climate Emergency declaration, pushing the city to become carbon neutral by 2030 - a measure later adopted by hundreds of councils and the UK Parliament.
She became the party's co-leader in 2021, before being elected as MP for Bristol Central last year, beating Labour shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire.
In May, Denyer announced she would not stand again as co-leader, saying she wanted to focus on her role as an MP.
Age: 43
Education: City of Norwich School, University of East Anglia
Family: Engaged with two children
Political career: Norwich City Councillor 2003-2011; Parliamentary candidate in Waveney Valley
Ramsay was born in Norwich and went to the local comprehensive school, while his dad worked in sales and his mum worked in a clothes shop.
He joined the Green Party when he turned 16 because he felt other parties were overlooking climate issues, poverty and animal cruelty. He went on to study politics to masters level.
After graduation, he became one of the youngest councillors in the country when he was first elected to Norwich City Council in 2003.
He has since served as chief executive of two environmental charities and has worked as a senior lecturer in environmental politics and economics.
Working as a councillor in Norwich between 2003 and 2011, Mr Ramsay helped the Green councillor group grow to become the largest in England.
He was also part of the team that helped Caroline Lucas become the first Green MP in Brighton Pavilion in 2010.
He has been in and out of the leadership and industry - he became the party's deputy leader in 2008 but did not stand in 2012 and moved into the renewables sector.
He was elected as co-leader alongside Denyer in 2021.
Last year he took the seat of Waveney Valley in East Anglia, beating the Conservative candidate by more than 5,000 votes.
In last year's general election four Green MPs were elected - Denyer, Ramsay, former London Assembly member Sian Berry and former MEP Ellie Chowns - marking the party's best result ever.
In May's local election's in parts of England the Greens also increased their number of councillors for the eighth year in a row.
The party had hoped to build on its success in south-west England, where the Greens are the biggest party on Bristol City Council and Denyer is an MP.
However, it missed out in the West of England mayoral race, coming third behind Labour and Reform UK."
Heat networks could warm Inverness homes in future,Highland Council has identified potential locations where buildings could be connected to new systems.,1 day ago,Highlands & Islands,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7zm15846ko,"Parts of Inverness have been identified as potential locations for large heating networks in the future.
Highland Council, along with Scotland's other local authorities, have been asked by the Scottish government to come up with strategies to improve energy efficiency.
Heat networks involve distributing energy from a central source, often using underground pipes to carry hot water.
Inverness' west bank of the River Ness, the city centre, Longman and Raigmore areas could have networks, according to a report to Highland Council's climate change committee.
Properties would be warmed by one or more systems that extract heat from air, water or underground.
Biomass, hydrogen and facilities that draw thermal energy from warm water households flush down drains could also be used.
Many of the properties are currently heated by mains gas.
The report to next week's committee meeting said the west bank had a ""high level"" of social housing and risk of fuel poverty.
It also contains buildings with high heating demands, including Highland Council's headquarters, Eden Court arts venue, Inverness Leisure swimming pool complex and the city's botanic gardens.
Another of the buildings, Inverness Ice Centre, has been struggling with its energy costs.
Council officers said the area could benefit from a heating network.
They said an energy centre could potentially be built on council-owned land near Highland Rugby Club's stadium.
Costs of building the network could run to £37m.
The officials said the city centre was one of the highest density areas in Inverness with more than 298 buildings.
They shops, offices, hotels, Eastgate Shopping Centre and also Inverness' castle and town house.
The costs of creating that network could be an estimated £44m.
Longman is an industrial area and officers have suggested waste water heating and hydrogen systems could be used.
Officers have recommended a number of networks across the area, with costs potentially running to almost £30m.
Raigmore includes housing, Raigmore Hospital, Inverness Campus and new prison HMP Highland.
Again the area could be broken up and covered by a number of heating networks with overall costs of more than £54m."

The aim - which was a previous SNP manifesto commitment - was to reduce the amount of kilometres travelled by car across the country in order to cut harmful emissions.
But car usage in Scotland has only fallen by 3.6% since before the Covid pandemic.
Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop told MSPs that the goal was ""not realistic and will need to be changed"".
In January Audit Scotland, which oversees Scottish government spending, and the Accounts Commission, which oversees local government spending, said there was a lack of leadership and ""no clear plan"" for reducing car usage.
The watchdogs concluded Scotland was ""unlikely"" to meet the 2030 target.
In the wake of that report, Hyslop appeared before Holyrood's Public Audit Committee, telling MSPs the 20% target was being reviewed.
The transport secretary said ministers would take advice from experts at the Climate Change Committee on what it should be - with this expected in May.
But Hyslop told MSPs: ""We will have more realistic targets.
""I'm reviewing the target, we won't be able to deliver 20% car kilometre reductions.
""We are reappraising what we are doing.""
Hyslop was asked directly by Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson if the Scottish government - which previously ditched its 2030 emissions reduction target - had ""dropped the target"" for cutting car kilometres.
The transport secretary said: ""We will need to drop the target, or change the target from 20%.""
She stressed the Scottish government will ""still want to support car use reduction"", but added: ""I think the figure of 20% is not realistic and will need to be changed.""
She accepted ""car use in Scotland is currently contributing significantly to carbon emissions, and that must change"".
Caroline Rance, Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns, called the development ""shameful"".
She said: ""One third of households in Scotland don't have access to a car, in our cities it's closer to a half. These are typically the poorest households, and poor public transport options means they are cut off from school, work and health appointments.
""Meanwhile, 2,700 people die every year from toxic air pollution and many more suffer from poor health because of it. Ministers failing to get a grip on car dominance means failing to protect these people.""
Scottish Greens' transport spokesperson Mark Ruskell MSP added: ""Emissions from transport remain the largest source of pollution in Scotland, and private car use makes up a huge share of that.
""We've known for decades that to tackle the climate emergency, we need to cut car use, and while the Scottish government has been strong with words, their actions have been lacking.""
Scottish ministers are now working with local government body Cosla and regional transport partnerships to take forward the recommendations made by Audit Scotland, Ms Hyslop said.
She stressed ""this is not something national government can do alone"", adding a renewed policy statement on car use reduction would be published jointly with Cosla later this spring.
Cosla environment spokeswoman Gail Macgregor accepted authorities ""haven't done as much as we should have done"".
She told the MSPs: ""We know we're behind, there has been many factors to that but what is key now is to look forward and ensure our route map is as it should be.
""We're looking at a more phased approach now, so we probably won't be delivering as ambitiously as we originally would have intended, but I think that is a reality check that we have to do that."""
Who is Anthony Albanese - Australia's re-elected prime minister?,"Elected on a wave of optimism in 2022, his support wobbled but ultimately endured.",3 May 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-61267489,"When Anthony Albanese announced an election would be held on 3 May, he reiterated a promise he made when he became Australia's prime minister three years ago - a mantra he said would define his government.
""No one held back, and no one left behind.""
For many, Albanese's ascension to the top job in 2022 had brought a sense of relief - at the demise of his deeply unpopular predecessor Scott Morrison - and hope for a new chapter, free of the political instability and national crises which had plagued successive governments.
Enjoying soaring popularity, Albanese immediately set about upping Australia's emissions reduction efforts, stabilising international relations and implementing key policy changes.
But after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction, Albanese - popularly known as Albo - faced the prospect of becoming the first single-term prime minister in almost a century.
However, on Saturday he managed to pull off an emphatic victory, with his Labor party winning an outright majority.
Albanese, 61, was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension - as he frequently reminds the public.
Having previously believed his father had died before he was born, he learned as a teenager that his mother had in fact fallen pregnant to a married man, who was likely still alive. Three decades later, he tracked down Carlo Albanese and flew to Italy to meet his father for the first time.
But it was his humble upbringing that Albanese says inspired his career in politics. A Labor Party stalwart since his 20s, Albanese was elected to an inner-city Sydney seat in 1996, on his 33rd birthday.
He is now one of  Australia's longest-serving MPs, and is seen by some as a ""working-class hero"". He has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a passionate rugby league fan, and supports Australia becoming a republic.
Albanese became a senior minister when Labor swept to power in 2007, and remained an influential figure as the party endured a tumultuous period during which it switched leaders - deposing Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for Julia Gillard - and then switched back again.
A leading voice of the Labor Party's left faction, Albanese has positioned himself more towards the centre since becoming leader in 2019.
He has said creating a better world for his own son, Nathan, is what continues to drive him. He divorced his wife of 19 years in 2019 and plans to marry his fiancé Jodie Haydon later this year.
Albanese's election to the country's highest office in 2022 ended a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition.
He came to power promising to reinvigorate the post-Covid economy, remove Australia from the ""naughty corner"" of global relations, lower the cost of living, and - critically - hold a referendum on Indigenous rights.
Climate was a key concern for voters and the international community at the time, and the government quickly enshrined into law a stronger emissions reduction target, as well as introduced a quasi-carbon cap for the country's biggest polluters. However, it has continued to approve oil and gas projects, and experts say there is still plenty the government could - and must - do when it comes to tackling climate change.
On China, after years of escalating tensions under the coalition government brought relations between the two countries to historic lows, the Albanese administration stabilised ties with Beijing, negotiating the end of a series of brutal tariffs and securing the first high level meetings in years.
It also reconciled with France, after the previous prime minister blindsided Paris with the cancellation of a multi-billion-dollar submarine contract, and reassured the Pacific that Australia would finally take its climate change concerns seriously.
Economic struggles, however, have beleaguered the government. After a brief bounce back post-pandemic, Australia's economy is growing at its slowest pace since the 1990s, lagging many of its peers, and the country is on the edge of recession amid financial woes worldwide.
Inflation, while it had slowed, pushed up the prices of everyday essentials and left many households struggling with the cost-of-living. The government's relief measures - which include tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance - had little impact on the worries of many Australians, for whom this was still the top issue in the election.
Housing is also of particular concern. In recent years, record house prices, underinvestment in social housing, a general shortage of homes and drastically climbing rents, have left much of the nation's growing population struggling to find a place to live. Albanese's first government introduced schemes to help low to moderate income earners own homes or rent more affordably, marginally boosted social housing, and pledged to ensure 1.2 million houses are built within the next five years.
It also curbed immigration and imposed limits on foreign buyers. Labor argued they were making ""significant"" progress on easing the crisis their government inherited, but critics said they were avoiding bolder, but necessary, reforms that are electorally unpopular with older, wealthier voters.
Though he has faced far fewer scandals than his predecessor, Scott Morrison, Albanese drew public backlash last year over what members of his own government privately decried as the poorly timed purchase of a multi-million-dollar cliff-top house.
But analysts say the biggest blight on his tenure is The Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.
It was one of Albanese's most defining policies - and his most striking setback. Despite the high levels of support the proposal had enjoyed the year prior, the vote was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.
Analysts say the Yes campaign - which Albanese's government did not lead but strongly supported - failed to explain the proposal effectively and struggled to engage voters who would rather the country focus on cost-of-living issues. The opposition - which was against the reform - laid the blame squarely at Albanese's feet, saying he had pursued a costly and divisive referendum that was always bound to fail.
The prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war. At first his government loudly supported Israel's right to defend itself. Then, as the number of deaths in Gaza climbed, it supported calls for a permanent ceasefire, urged restraint from Israel, and reiterated its support for recognising Palestinian statehood once Hamas is defeated.
Conservatives accused Albanese of abandoning Israel and blamed his government for a rise in antisemitic attacks in Australia, while protesters have camped outside his office saying he effectively reneged on his previous support of Palestinians.
Ahead of the election, his government pledged a record funding injection into Medicare - Australia's universal healthcare system - which will make it free for most people to see a GP, a promise the coalition immediately matched, as well as small tax cuts and reductions to student debt.
Albanese's approval rating hit its lowest point earlier in 2025, and though it later lifting, polling still predicted a rocky path for him retaining office - a sharp contrast to his mostly positive first year in the job.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton argued Albanese had been distracted with his own agenda, while Australia has gone backwards: ""Because of Labor's bad decisions, Australians are doing it tough and they need help,"" he said.
Albanese, meanwhile, insisted his party had saved Australia from the brunt of tough global conditions, and had the better vision for the country's future.
In the end, Albanese had the last laugh - earning a second term in office, while Dutton lost both the election and his seat.
In his victory speech, Albanese said his party would not take the trust the public had placed in them ""for granted"" and promised greater social support, as well as working on reconciliation with First Nations peoples.
""Because together we are turning the corner and together we are making our way forward, with no one held back and no one left behind."""
Green Party councillors elated to win first seats,A county council's first Green councillors vow to ensure the climate is considered in decisions.,3 May 2025,Cambridgeshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrnr3e0w7o,"Green Party candidates elected to a county council for the first time said they felt elated and privileged to have won in the local elections.
The Greens now have three councillors on Cambridgeshire County Council.
Peter Charles Rees was elected in the Newnham division, Elliot Tong in the Abbey division and Darren James Green in Romsey.
Rees said he was ""absolutely elated"" to be voted in and hoped to ""bring the voice for the climate crisis"" to decisions made by the county council.
Tong said he felt ""very privileged"" to have been elected to represent an area he loved.
""There is a lot of stuff that needs changing around the city,"" he said.
""We are seeing our infrastructure suffer greatly, we are seeing our services suffer greatly, all while taxes get higher and higher every year, which is pushing people further into poverty.
""We need to make sure we are getting residents the quality of service they deserve and actually stand up for them.""
The Liberal Democrats won overall control of the county council, with 31 councillors elected to the authority.
The party has run the county council as part of a joint administration with Labour and Independent councillors for the last four years.
Lib Dem councillor Alex Beckett said: ""We have been working with Labour for the last four years but it is great for us to finally be in control to be able to bring forward our proper Liberal values and make sure that we can really get things going again for all of Cambridgeshire.""

Fingerprints of city-sized icebergs found off UK coast,Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.,24 Apr 2025,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xz664r2do,"Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.
Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.
It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.
The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.
The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.
This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.
The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.
Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.
""We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,"" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.
""These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.""
Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.
By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.
That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.
The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.
Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.
""Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'""
Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.
But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.
Exactly how this plays out, though, is ""one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise"", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.
That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.
No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.
By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.
The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.
That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.
And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.
The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.
Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.
""These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,"" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.
""But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,"" he argued.

Hosepipe ban in some areas amid water level concerns,"Restrictions will apply to Mullingar in County Westmeath, Milford in County Donegal, and Kells-Oldcastle in County Meath from Tuesday 6 May.",6 May 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d0jvve67o,"A hose pipe ban has been introduced in Milford in County Donegal, Mullingar in County Westmeath, and Kells-Oldcastle in County Meath amid concerns over very low water levels.
The restrictions will apply from Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Uisce Éireann (Irish Water) has said dry conditions stretching back to last autumn, through winter, and into spring have led to a sharp drop in water supply at key reservoirs.
Milford in County Donegal is supplied by Lough Colmcille. Both it and Lough Bane, which serves the Kells-Oldcastle area, are at historically low levels.
Lough Owel, which supplies Mullingar, is now at its lowest level for 50 years.
The water conservation order bans the use of hose pipes for domestic and certain non-domestic uses, such as watering gardens outside businesses.
The organisation says this is aimed at preserving water for essential services.
""The past 12 months have been drier than normal when compared to the long-term average"" according to Margaret Attridge, head of water operations.
""This means that some water sources which traditionally would have replenished over the winter period have not seen the same level of recovery.""
""As a result, we are starting to experience issues with water availability at these sources,"" Ms Attridge said
Despite the targeted nature of the restrictions the utility has urged all households and businesses across Ireland to use water wisely as the country enters the summer months.
Earlier in 2025 Irish weather service, Met Éireann, reported that rainfall was below average at most weather stations in the Republic during winter.
The organisation also reported that autumn in 2024 was the 17th driest since records began in 1940.
In Northern Ireland, NI Water has said reservoirs are at a healthy position for the time of year despite experiencing a winter and spring with less than average rainfall.
""Rain in mid-April helped bring reservoir levels back up to 93% capacity"" according to Water Supply Manager, Maynard Cousley.
""However, it is a timely reminder that our weather patterns are changing and we cannot take our water supply for granted.
""We must use our water supply wisely so we can conserve it for when we need it most.""
In a their April publication, the EU's Copernicus climate service has placed Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland into a drought warning status, moving from a drought watch status earlier in 2025.
This indicates low rainfall is now accompanied by declining soil-moisture levels and the first signs of vegetation stress, they said.
According to the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, river flows in March ended the month ""exceptionally low"" across Northern Ireland."
Is resurrecting extinct animals a good idea?,"The creation of three ""dire wolf"" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.",25 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250425-why-scientists-fear-attempts-to-resurrect-extinct-animals-may-backfire,"The creation of three ""dire wolf"" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.
When news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.
The story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. ""I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,"" Martin wrote on his blog.
Martin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.
Colossal – which is currently valued at $10bn (£7.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA – boldly states on its website that it's ""going to fix"" the problem of extinction.
According to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. ""We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,"" James tells the BBC.
De-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves – which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features – represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.
In the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.
The BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.
Chief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.
Such a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.
""It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,"" he says.
This worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior – who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement – praised the company's work on X as a new ""bedrock for modern species conservation"". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the ""endangered species list"" – presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government – thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. ""Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation – not regulation – that has spawned American greatness,"" he wrote.
Biodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.
Colossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to ""ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list"" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.
While Colossal's de-extinction work is ""super-cool science,"" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.
Colossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.
However, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.
Some research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities – where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans – to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.
There could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun – an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.
""Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,"" Sekar says. ""It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.""
James calls for more research to resolve these questions and show ""direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey"".
Dire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.
Modern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.
""That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,"" she says. ""If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.""
Julie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. ""These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,"" she says.
""I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,"" she adds. ""That is unfortunate.""
James at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just ""one piece of a very complex puzzle"" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like ""a giant ship"" pulling ""all these other projects in its wake"".
It is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. ""What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.""
This in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.
In the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality ""genetically modified grey wolves"", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.
But scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white ""because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones"", Gill says. ""This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.""
Even if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. ""A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.""
Colossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.
In the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants – extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings – should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. ""Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?"" asks Sekar.
James says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to ""avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead"".
Colossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme – but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.
While Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being ""the right investment to make"".
For every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.
But while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing ""how the animal is going to survive on the ground"", the genetic component becomes ""kind of irrelevant"".
Herpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.
Colossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.
""Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,"" Sekar says. ""If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.""

Testing the boundaries for planned giant reservoir,Engineers test designs for clay embankments which could hold 150 million cubic metres of water.,7 days ago,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd020e02k4jo,"Engineers are testing newly built embankments that could form part of one of the UK's largest reservoirs, serving London and south-east England.
The £2.2bn South East Strategic Reservoir Option (SESRO), near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, is a Thames Water project to cope with increasing demand and climate change.
It has attracted government backing, but also criticism from councils and environmentalists ahead of an expected planning application in 2026.
At the site near Steventon, compacted clay has been formed into 3m (10ft) walls to test ways of containing up to 150 billion litres of water.
The site feels vast as a small group of us, clad in bright orange PPE and hard hats, view the current clay compaction tests.
The statistics being reeled out on Thames Water's tour back up the scale of the project.
SESRO would cover about 7 sq km (2.7 sq miles), stretching as far as the eye can see as we look north.
Head of engagement, land and consents Leonie Dubois is adamant about the ever-increasing need.
""We know through climate change, we've had the hottest May 1st on record and the driest March on record,"" she points out.
""We know through population growth and we also know through our desire to have less impact on the environment that our water resources are under pressure.""
In January, Chancellor Rachel Reeves indicated government support for the Abingdon reservoir.
However, it has met with environmental objections from the Campaign to Protect Rural England as well as Oxfordshire County Council and Vale of White Horse District Council.
SESRO will be a non-impounding reservoir, allowing water flow, which will have embankments up to 25m (80 feet) high.
The construction team on the tour are keen for us to imagine tree-planted gentle slopes rather than sheer walls.
The current work is testing small-scale versions of those embankments.
But from where I'm currently standing, in the hole where they extracted the Kimmeridge clay, it feels enormous.
""We've dug the clay out of the ground and we've essentially squeezed it to understand how it performs under pressure,"" explains Leonie Dubois.
She says she is keen to address local opposition, which has focused on environmental impacts.
""We understand that when infrastructure is developed close to communities they have concerns which is why I have a dedicated team of engagement people here every day talking to customers understanding what their concerns are.
""We're also very keen to hear what people want from this site. This will be here for hundreds of years. It will be something close to communities, so what would they like?""
Thames Water and partners Southern Water and Affinity Water are hoping the reservoir will come on stream in 2040.
As our guide walks us back up the slope out of the burrow pit, he points out the hundreds of ammonite fossils revealed after millions of years buried deep in the clay.
If the compaction trials prove successful, they will be covered up for centuries more – this time by water.

"Road upgrade welcomed but more needed, haulier says",Four years of construction work will end when the route is officially opened on Friday.,2 May 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6lwj54j2o,"A £60m upgrade to a key road for tourism and freight in south-west Wales brings ""light at the end of the tunnel"" after years of congestion, but more projects are needed in Wales, a haulier has said.
The improvements to the four-mile stretch of the A40 near Narberth, Pembrokeshire, are designed to help traffic.
Construction on the road began four years ago, before the Welsh government's decision in 2023 to cancel all future road building projects.
Haulage company director Scott Davies welcomed the new stretch of road, but said work was needed elsewhere, such as a relief road around Newport, which the Welsh government previously said had ""come and gone"".
Transport Secretary Ken Skates has said some schemes could be considered if they ""reflected the reality of the climate emergency"", while a further £25m has been announced to renew Wales' major roads and prevent around 30,000 road defects.
The upgraded carriageway is not dualled but does include more places to overtake safely.
There have been improvements to roundabouts, while new junctions have been built at Llanddewi Velfrey and Redstone Cross.
Summer traffic in the area can increase by 30%, with the holiday congestion becoming a key factor in planning to upgrade the route.
The Welsh government said the work would reduce journey times to ports such as Milford Haven, Wales' busiest for freight which handles about 40 million tonnes per year, as well as Fishguard and Pembroke Dock.
""The improvement was definitely needed,"" said Mr Davies, a director of MDS Distribution.
""Hopefully we'll see the benefits of the new roads, with the two lanes in some areas for overtaking.""
He said school holidays used to be a ""terrible"" time on the road.
""We're very lucky in our area, we do have the beautiful coast. However, it does bring many holidaymakers down to add the extra pressure on the road networks. So it was needed.""
But he added road improvements were also needed elsewhere on the south Wales network, with a ""desperate"" need for a relief road around Newport.
""It's a bottleneck. At the end of the day, there's three lanes going into two.
""There is a lot of traffic coming into Wales, and it is an issue that needs addressing.""
All road building projects were scrapped under Mark Drakeford's administration, but that stance has been slightly softened under the current Welsh government, although it has said it would not build a relief road around Newport.
Along the upgraded A40 there is optimism about the impact of the improved road, following years of disruption.
""It's done, thank goodness it's finished and let's see how it goes,"" said Clive Edwards of Taf Valley Coaches.
He said he was looking forward ""to some kind of normal, and hope that everything will operate safely once the improvements are done.""
Wales' transport secretary said the Welsh government continued to build roads and develop new road schemes ""in a better way, where they are the right solution consistent with the climate and nature emergencies"".
""Fixing our roads is a priority. We recently announced a further £25m to renew Wales' major roads and prevent around 30,000 road defects, and we've unlocked £120m to improve local authority roads,"" Skates added."
Royal Parks plan 'vibrant' tribute to Elizabeth II,The new garden in Regent's Park will commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's life.,23 Apr 2025,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm25y69rvp6o,"Work is under way in Regent's Park on a new garden to commemorate the life of Queen Elizabeth II, which is due to open this time next year.
The Royal Parks said the garden, described as biodiverse and climate-resilient, will be a space in central London for reflection and connection with the natural world.
Some of the plant species will be native to Commonwealth countries, selected for both their beauty and their ability to thrive in a changing climate.
The garden is in addition to the UK National Memorial to Queen Elizabeth II, which will be in St James's Park, close to Buckingham Palace.
The late Queen became the patron of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) in 1952, the year she acceded to the throne, and attended the RHS Chelsea Flower Show regularly during her 70-year reign.
The Regent's Park commemorative garden, due to open in April 2026, the centenary of the late Queen's birth, is designed to transform a redundant brownfield site into a thriving green space rich in wildlife.
This includes 2,000 sq m of wildflower meadows for invertebrates and more than 5,000 sq m of climate-resilient, pollinator-friendly planting.
The two-acre site is four months into the 16-month build, and key features are emerging, which include newly laid paths.
Work has also begun on a circular pond, designed to enhance habitats for local wildlife.
More than 200,000 bulbs and 40 trees have been ordered to create a colourful, nectar-rich garden.
The garden will reference Queen Elizabeth II's life and service by using plants significant to the late monarch or with royal associations, such as the specially bred Narcissus ""Diamond Jubilee"" or Tulipa ""Royal Celebration"".
It will also include her favourite plants like lily of the valley.
The Royal Parks said recruitment was underway for a dedicated team of horticultural staff to look after the garden.
It will join other renowned gardens in Regent's Park, that includes Queen Mary's Gardens, home to London's largest collection of roses.
Matthew Pottage, head of horticulture and landscape strategy at The Royal Parks, said the garden would be ""a space for reflection, biodiversity, and connection with the natural world"".

Spring's hot weather to be treat for nature lovers,A spell of hot weather will give a boost to nature as migratory birds return and butterflies emerge.,26 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0780j0rpx3o,"With what's being called a mini-heatwave looming for the UK, it's not just humans looking forward to warmer weather.
The warm spell is expected to give a temporary boost to nature as migratory birds arrive from afar and butterflies stretch their wings.
The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) says a succession of milder winters and wetter springs are all contributing to change in the natural world.
While a brief warm spell won't make much difference to the natural world overall, it could be a bonus for nature lovers.
""On the plus side, better weather is more inviting for us to get out and enjoy the spring. Dawn chorus is at its peak at the minute and calm, warm mornings are perfect for enjoying it,"" says Jon Carter of the BTO.
The Met Office says a brief spell of warmth at the end of April isn't a bad thing for wildlife - and there shouldn't be much impact to water sources such as ponds.
""Climate change is already having a big impact on our wildlife, but a temporary blip like this is an end of April dividend for wildlife,"" says the Met Office's Grahame Madge.
Some wildlife accelerates its activity with warm spring weather, so people may see natural areas near them teaming with life this coming week.
Butterflies and birds may be particularly prominent, Mr Madge adds.
Some studies suggest warm weather means birds can breed earlier in the year and do not need to incubate their young for as long.
Migratory birds - such as swallows and swifts - that return to the UK because there are more insects to feed on in warmer climes, may be coming back sooner. The Met Office says a swallow was reported in southern England before March this year.
Warm weather can also see butterflies emerge. Hotter days earlier in the year can bring out red admirals, previously an exclusively migratory insect.
The peacock and small tortoiseshell are among the first to spread their wings, with more butterflies emerging from April onwards.
Dragonflies start to be seen around this time, too.
There could also be some sightings of rare visitors such as the exotic European bee-eater, which have recently begun nesting in the UK.
Wildlife charities say it's a great time to get out and about and enjoy nature, but people should be on their guard against accidentally starting a fire.
Oliver Fry of Surrey Wildlife Trust says conditions are incredibly dry on the heathlands of Surrey, which creates ""tinderbox conditions"".
The wild, flat landscapes dotted with gorse and heather are known for their wildlife, including rare species like the sand lizard, woodlark and silver-studded blue butterfly.
Earlier this month, conservationists warned that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being ""torched alive"" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires.
Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring.
""It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,"" she says. ""This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife – with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.""
On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores – and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor.
""Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,"" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.
Heatwaves and increases in sea temperatures can cause some whales to roam far from their usual areas just to survive, he adds.

Project to suck carbon out of sea begins in UK,A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.,18 Apr 2025,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr788kljlklo,"A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.
The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.
There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.
But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.

These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.
What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.
To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says ""Caution: Moray Eels may Bite"".
There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.
It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.
The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.
SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.

We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.
He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.
""This is the seawater stripper"" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.
The ""stripper"" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.
""When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out."" Prof Bell says. ""What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.""
The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.
The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it – to neutralise the acid that was added – and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.
Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.
There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air – but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.
""Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,"" says Dr Halloran.
""But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.""
At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny – at most 100 metric tonnes per year – that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.
In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.
For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon – would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.
""Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,"" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.
""Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.""
The Seacure project has £3m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.
""Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,"" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. ""Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.""
There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.
Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.
""Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,"" he says. ""So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.""
Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.
""It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that – for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on."""
Four ways your plants could be affected by hot spring weather,"With warm weather hitting the UK, here's what gardening experts advise for keeping your plants alive.",1 May 2025,UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0xznpj61go,"With parts of the UK recording their hottest ever start to May, this week's hot spring weather will undoubtedly have an effect on plants - both inside and outdoors.
Experts say that while the unusually warm weather this early in the year could pose some issues for some plants, others stand to benefit and flourish.
Indoor plants will need protecting, and trees could suffer - but outdoor plants may thrive if watered properly, in particular those producing fruit.
Here's what the experts we spoke to had to say about the warm weather - and what they advise green-fingered folk do to make the most of it.
Increased temperatures and too much direct sunlight can have a negative effect on houseplants.
Signs like wilting, drooping, or changing colour could indicate that the heat is getting to your beloved leafy greens.
Conservatories and greenhouses, similarly, can get too hot unless shading is provided, Guy Barter, the Royal Horticultural Society's chief horticulturist, told the BBC.
""Houseplants can scorch in bright sunlight unless moved back deeper into rooms where there is more shade.""
He suggested providing additional shading from now until September to prevent heat damage.
If space is a factor, using a sheer curtain can also help mitigate the impacts of direct sunlight.
The warmer than average start to May is already having a noticeable affect on the timing of this year's harvest, according to Pauline Goodall, a strawberry farmer from Limington in Somerset.
In the past week, she told BBC Breakfast her small farm had gone from filling three to four trays of strawberries a day to 50.
""They're just ripening at a phenomenal rate.""
Helena Dove, head of Kew Gardens' kitchen garden, said they had also already seen ripe strawberries - and that this was a trend for other fruits being grown in the UK.
""Traditionally, a good kitchen gardener would be proud to have ripe strawberries by Wimbledon,"" she told the BBC.
However, Mr Barter cautioned that while the days were warmer, night time temperatures were still relatively low, limiting the ""helpful"" effects of the warmth.
He said the risk of frost would pass in the south soon, allowing ""frost-tender plants"" such as dahlias and tomatoes to be planted outside.
During times of hotter weather, outdoor plants and flowers will typically require more water than usual.
That's particularly true for plants that have recently been put in the ground,  according to Tony Hall, the head of Kew Gardens' temperate collections. He told the BBC it was essential that they are well watered ""to encourage a deep root system"".
""Hot weather tends to weed out plants that are in poor health and already struggling, but this can present an opportunity to plant something that is more drought tolerant,"" he said.
Mr Barter said newly sown seeds and recently planted vegetables, flowers and shrubs will need ""careful watering"" until they grow their roots out enough.
But he added that more warmth and extra light earlier in the year ""helps them send out strong roots to counter any drought later in the summer"".
For both indoor and outdoor plants, the advice is to water in morning or evening, but not in the middle of the day when the water will evaporate quickly.
At this time of year, trees are entering into their leaf expansion phase - a process that demands substantial physiological resources, including water.
Kevin Martin, Kew Gardens' head of trees, explained that the recent warmer weather - coupled with an existing soil moisture deficit - is creating a ""worrying"" situation.
If these conditions persist, he warned it could hamper a tree's ability to carry out photosynthesis, reducing growth and leaving them exposed to further decline over the summer.
Mr Martin suggested planting ""better-suited species"" of trees that have ""greater built-in resilience as we experience more extreme conditions"".
This recent bout of warm weather is because of a fluctuation in the jet stream - a river of fast-flowing air that tends to divide warmer air close to the equator from colder air further north - bringing warm air up from the Mediterranean.
While scientists say climate change is making these fluctuations more erratic, how much influence climate change has on particular weather events requires a full scientific study.
Paul Hadaway, from the Kent Wildlife Trust, told the BBC that the spring warmth was part of a larger trend of ""seasonality breaking down"".
""Last year we had a mild winter, warm spring and then we had a wet summer – and that's not good for wildlife that's learned to adapt to a certain climate pattern,"" he told BBC Breakfast.
He said people in the UK could mitigate the negative effects of this seasonal breakdown by rethinking ""how we manage our naturals areas"", including planting new species that are better accustomed to these extreme swings.
Ms Dove, of Kew's kitchen garden, said that while ""traditional"" fruits like apples were struggling, ""the warm spring means crops like citrus, kiwi, and tropical plants are thriving earlier, with longer seasons and better yields"".
She added: ""We're even growing peaches, apricots, and nectarines outside currently, something that would have been unthinkable in previous years due to the risk of late frosts and lack of early pollinators.""
Meanwhile, the RHS says species of oak and ash tree could be more adaptable to withstand extreme changes in the seasons."
"'Worrying' decline of crucial insects in NI, says charity",The abundance of flying insects in the countryside in NI has fallen by 55% since 2021.,1 May 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xel5qpqzo,"The decline of insects in Northern Ireland is ""worrying"", a charity has warned.
Buglife carries out a Bugs Matter ""splat survey"" every year, where people count the number of insects on a car licence plate after a journey and record the figure on an app.
The latest results in Northern Ireland show the abundance of flying insects in the countryside has fallen by 55% since 2021, but the rate of decline has slowed.
And across all the UK nations, the number of insect splats has fallen by 63%.
The survey is expanding into the Republic of Ireland from this year.
It opened on Wednesday.
Hannah Fullerton from Buglife in Northern Ireland said insects are crucial to our wellbeing.
""I like to remind people that, if you like to eat, then you like our insects.
""They also do other handy things, like they'll break down wood or leaves lying around and they help feed our mammals.""
And while we might be enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, she said it can pose a risk to our insect populations.
""Whenever the nice sunny weather comes out, our insects come out and think, great, it's time to get to work,"" said Hannah.
""And then suddenly, it begins to rain, the temperature starts to drop and that can have devastating effects for our invertebrates because they've come out of hibernation.
""This is resulting from climate change as well, which is a big issue that we're suffering from as well as over-use of herbicides and pesticides.""

The annual five-month long survey is led by Kent Wildlife Trust.
""This huge decrease in insect splats over such a short time is really alarming,"" said Dr Lawrence Ball from the Trust.
""It's most likely that we are seeing the compounding effects of both a background rate of decline as well as a short-term cycle of decline, perhaps linked to the extreme climate in recent years.
""Hopefully, splats up 6% on last year indicates a slowing decline.
""A larger sample of journeys from Northern Ireland will help to reveal the overall trend.""
Extending the survey into the Republic of Ireland is ""a crucial next step"", said Rebecca Lewis from Buglife NI.
""To gather data on the health of insect populations on an all-Ireland basis will provide essential data to support future nature restoration efforts.""
Planting wildflowers, letting weeds grow and leaving some wood or small piles of stones in our gardens can help support our vulnerable insects, like solitary bees, said Hannah.
""If we get nature back it'll help look after itself."""
New Lincolnshire mayor 'must embrace nature',Wildlife groups are calling on the new mayor to support environmental improvement.,29 Apr 2025,Lincolnshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87p2e47j2no,"Wildlife and conservation groups say it is ""essential"" that the new Lincolnshire mayor embraces nature and supports environmental improvement.
Groups including The Woodland Trust, National Trust, RSPB, Friends of the Earth and Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust issued the call to the mayoral candidates ahead of Thursday's election.
The organisations said the mayor must shape a ""greener, more resilient future"", including building climate resilience, cutting emissions and restoring wetlands and soils.
Caroline Killeavey, from National Trust, said: ""It's about recognising the power of nature and the power of the environment to people's lives.""
Paul Learoyd, chief executive of Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, said it was an important opportunity for Greater Lincolnshire.
""We hope the new mayor will embrace nature and see it as part of the solution to many of the issues we face as an area,"" he said.
Mr Learoyd said he hoped the mayor would also bring together areas such as food, farming and flooding.
He added: ""This is an opportunity for the whole of Lincolnshire to work together and the Wildlife Trust has a history of working with local authorities from the Humber down to Gibraltar Point in the south of the county.""
Ms Killeavey said the Sandilands Nature Reserve, which is under construction on the site of a former golf course, was a ""great example"" of how conservationists have worked closely with local authorities.
""National Trust's investment here, along with all the partners and local authorities, is going to make a massive difference to people's lives,"" she said.
""When this is completed in a few months everyone will have access to really good quality nature - this will benefit everything from people's health to the local economy.""
She said she would be contacting the new mayor once elected to invite them down to Sandilands.
Sally Horscroft, from the Green Party, said: ""If we are to cut climate emissions and improve our environment, we must learn to work with nature"", adding that it was vital to recognise the importance of nature to our well-being.
Independent candidate Marianne Overton said she had been a ""staunch supporter""  of Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust for many years, and was strongly in favour of natural solutions wherever possible. She said she was also an advocate for ""solar on roofs, not farmland"".
Jason Stockwood, from Labour, said: ""If elected, I will put protecting and enhancing our coast, countryside and natural environment at the heart of our region's future.""
Rob Waltham, Conservative, said: ""By balancing growth with green investment we can achieve our goals of protecting and enhancing nature and wildlife for our area.""
He said his aim would be to plant more trees and create new nature reserves, along with off-road cycle routes.
The BBC has contacted the remaining candidates for their views.

The country sparking Africa's e-bike revolution,"Rwanda has some 100,000 motorbikes and wants to turn them all electric. Can green tech steer Africa towards the future?",5 days ago,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250508-rwanda-is-sparking-africas-e-bike-revolution,"There are 100,000 motorbikes in Rwanda. The country wants to turn them all electric, and startups say their plans can make it work. Can green tech steer Africa towards the future?
Over the past decade, electric vehicles have been an integral part of the West's planned transition to green energy, offering a variety of opportunities for carbon-hungry industries such as transportation, freight and logistics. But outside of urban hubs in places like the US, the EU and east Asia, the promise of e-mobility is often harder to realise. In Africa, for example, widespread problems with power distribution are a serious roadblock for the adoption of electric vehicles. Rwanda, however, is thinking differently.
The tiny East African nation has a grand plan to convert its over 100,000 motorbikes to e-bikes. Officials know the project will put significant pressure on the country's electricity grid, but a host of e-bike startups are experimenting with innovative solutions. That includes solar-powered electricity stations, battery swapping plans, repurposing or recycling batteries as they wear down, and mini-grids (small, localised power generation systems that operate off-grid). The aim is to power large e-bike fleets without interrupting its national electricity distribution. If it works, this could be a model for the rest of Africa and other corners of the developing world.
Rwanda's greenhouse gas emissions were projected to double between 2015 and 2030, but interest in e-mobility exploded after the government pledged to reduce its rising emissions by 38% during the same period (approximately 4.6 metric tonnes). Other African countries like Kenya, Togo, Nigeria and South Africa have rolled out assertive policies to promote their transition to clean energy – from subsidies on renewable energy to tax breaks and reduced import duties on electric vehicles.
Yet Rwanda is recording the most success, says Michael Irenge, an engineer based in the country who works at NETIS Group, a telecommunications and energy infrastructure firm. With cutting-edge renewable energy plans, a $300m (£226m) investment project to finance climate resilience, government incentives for electric vehicles and a host of enterprising e-bike startups, Irenge and others argue that Rwanda is helping to set new standards for African e-mobility.
For several decades before Rwanda's ambitious ""Green Growth"" pivot, gas-powered motorcycles were the norm – a staple even, as in many other African countries. This poses a problem. In 2021, the Rwandan National Gas Inventory Commission showed that taxi motorcycles alone contributed the equivalent of 427.45 gigagrams of CO2, making up 32% of the total emissions from road traffic.
Companies such as Ampersand, Spiro, eWaka and Rwanda Electric Motors (REM) say they have the solution. Startups have already sold, rented and leased thousands of these motorbikes (or ""motars"", as they're known in Rwanda) through cost-effective schemes, according to Toffene Kama, a Senegalese venture capitalist with investments in the electric vehicle industry. ""In many cases, the battery will be provided by the e-bike operating company which rents them out,"" which makes the bikes more accessible by lowering upfront costs, Kama says. So far, their mission to push riders to switch from fossil fuel to electric vehicles has taken off on a broad scale, he says, thanks in large part to heavy support from the government.
On two major fronts, these startups are making progress. First, they're helping the country cut down carbon emissions from road traffic, according to Josh Whale, chief executive of the e-bike company Ampersand. Whale says the bikes can eliminate a dramatic share of the annual greenhouse gas emissions you'd expect from a traditional motorcycle.
""Depending on what the grid mix is [the proportionate shares of a power grid's energy sources], our e-bikes eliminate 75% to 100% emissions of greenhouse gases every year,"" he says. A 100% cut would require an entirely renewable energy system, but still, Ampersand says the 2,750 bikes it currently has in the country curb about 7,000 tonnes of emissions a year.
A Rwandan government official who spoke to the BBC confirmed these figures. ""As of March 2024, Rwanda has about 4,800 electric motorcycles in operation,"" the official says. ""According to the global average, each bike can cut down 2.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, but the reduction can differ based on renewable energy in the grid."" Though the government hasn't quantified the related overall carbon emissions, replacing gas motorcycles is already reaping climate benefits for the East African country.
The startups are also helping to cut down costs for both taxi motorcycles and delivery companies, the primary target market for these products. ""I can confirm that an e-bike sells for about the same price as a traditional gas-powered bike on average [about £880, or $1,168] without the battery. But recharging them takes less than half of the cost of purchasing fuel for the same distances,"" Kama says. To reduce the upfront cost, riders can choose to retrofit old gas-powered bikes with an electric engine, apply for loans or rent batteries. Renting is becoming the most popular option, he adds.
""A lot of the finance providers offer cheap credit to purchases of our electric motorbikes because we separate the cost of the battery. It works on a pay-as-you-go basis,"" Whale says. ""The net result is that the customers end up enjoying lower interest rates and the cost of the bike ends up being the same or even cheaper than the conventional petrol bike."" Ampersand says its riders save about $400 to $750 (about £305 to £572) yearly on their e-bikes.
Africa has never been at the forefront of stable electricity distribution, yet some countries are recording more progress than others, particularly in East Africa. In Rwanda, concerted efforts by the government have seen a consistent rise in power distribution across the country over the past decade, though promised developments don't always match reality.
Ron Weiss, the former chief executive of the Rwandan Energy Group (REG), predicted in 2018 that power outages would end by 2020, in line with REG's grand financing plan to scale electricity. Since then, the company says the number of households hooked up to the national electricity grid went from 43% in 2018 to 53% in 2024. But Rwandans still complain about consistent power outages impacting their commercialisation efforts, and REG has fallen far short of its goals, according to a recent report in Rwanda's New Times newspaper. The company plans to beat this problem with several off-grid energy sources, but says it needs heavy funding and another four years to complete the effort.
Electricity distribution is a serious hurdle, says Emmanuel Mayani, a Rwandan clean energy research assistant at the University of Michigan in the US. E-bikes require regular charging – some three to five times a day – and the majority of charging stations for e-bike start-ups in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa are still predominantly grid-reliant.
""Even though they plan to pivot to renewable energy sources, charging infrastructure for many e-bike startups still largely relies on grid technology, as this is what is most convenient for them and the region they're in,"" Mayani says.
Experts believe that a high demand for e-bikes and large-scale expansion plans for these startups mean more charging stations will fill up cities, especially as the Rwandan government is providing rent-free land for charging infrastructure. That could be a problem.
Mayani stresses that this could lead to more frequent power outages that could affect residential and commercial electricity supply, and strain infrastructure that is already struggling to keep up with growing demand. ""If you keep increasing just the e-bikes, you're increasing consumers of electricity without increasing the source, the generation or the amount of electricity the consumers are going to access,"" he says. This will exacerbate load shedding, the name for intentionally planned power outages which are meant to take pressure off the grid, he adds.
But Mayani also thinks this issue can be abated if there's an alternative to support the grid, and solar power is a good start. ""[The government] could bring in solar panel providers to take the pressure off,"" he says. ""It's a good alternative for people in rural communities who'll experience these outages more.""
As the Rwandan government works to use renewable energy sources to build its grid infrastructure by 2030, Ampersand is already installing solar panels in its battery swap stations to target a large part of the country's off-grid regions. Experts hope that other e-bike companies will follow suit.
Rwanda gets some of the highest energy from solar radiation in Africa, far beyond what solar panels require, and Ampersand plans to use this to its advantage. The company has already executed this in some rural areas in Kenya, where the availability of rentable land made it easy to install ground-mounted solar converters, according to Whale. It made combining grid energy with solar for Ampersand swap stations seamless.
Elsewhere in Africa, companies are testing solar power as an off-grid alternative for e-bike charging. Startups like Ghana's Kofa use solar energy to power their battery swap stations, while others like Ampersand opt for a combination with grid energy. In these swap stations, sets of batteries are at all times connected to a charging system – about 20 to 40 of them, according to Kama. E-bike riders drive in every three to four hours for a battery exchange, and replacing a run-down battery with a fully charged one is quick, he says. ""The swapping process is like a two-minute thing,"" Kama explains. ""Sometimes it's even faster than, for example, refueling [a gas-powered motorcycle] in an oil and gas station."" (Read more about China's battery swap stations for electric vehicles).
Another way Ampersand gets solar energy is through its partnership with the oil company TotalEnergies. Total has solar generators at 1,000 of its 4,800 petrol stations in Africa, selling electricity to a variety of different players, including EV startups. Ampersand uses a shared space with them and directly taps into Total's solar generators to charge its batteries.
This means ""we don't have to make an upfront capital investment in the solar project"", Whale says. This kind of arrangement isn't common in Rwanda yet, but Ampersand plans to extend the partnership to the country soon.
Spiro, one of Africa's largest e-bike startups which has put over 17,000 bikes across Togo, Benin, Kenya and recently, Rwanda, uses grid energy for its operations. But in its plans for expansion, the company is thinking about solar power.
""We're an Equitane group company, and another subsidiary of the company is called Solen, which is into rooftop solar installation,"" says Kaushik Burman, Spiro's chief executive. ""There are conversations happening for Solen to install a solar project that would be feedstock for our swap stations.""
According to Burman, a more practical concern about renewable energy is how it can be preserved for long-term use. ""We don't get renewable power 24 hours a day,"" he says, ""so we have to think about how to store that energy to be able to use it during the hours when the sun isn't shining. That's what we're concerned about.""
Whale agrees. Whether it's wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower or biomass-powered battery stations, energy can only be maximised if it can be properly stored. Ampersand aims to get out in front of this problem by focusing on two things: using advanced battery technology, and repurposing spent batteries for energy projects like mini-grids (a set of small electricity generators functioning as a single, independent system).
""Because we've had motorcycles on the road for over five years now, we are starting to look at what happens to the batteries once they reach the end of their first life – which is when they're over five years old and they've degraded down to the point where they're only 80% of their original capacity,"" Whale says. ""What we can do is repurpose those batteries and repack them into larger units that can provide energy storage for off-grid solar systems like mini-grids."" Not only will these batteries power e-bikes, Ampersand plans to open these mini-grids for communal use.
In Africa, mini-grids are gaining momentum in weak-grid and off-grid areas, and could provide electricity to 380 million people by 2030. E-bikes often use lithium iron phosphate batteries (LiFePO4), and a World Economic Forum (WEF) report says the stability, durability and performance of these batteries make them particularly well suited for mini-grids. In fact, the WEF report argues that used batteries, given a second life, often work better than the brand new batteries that are typically sold in markets that are just getting access to power.
Ampersand is already repurposing its old e-bike batteries in partnership with SLS Energy, a Rwandan e-waste management company that uses retired batteries to provide a variety of low-cost energy solutions.
So far, the partnership with Ampersand has launched a 120kWh mini-grid in Zambia, according to Léandre Berwa, SLS Energy's chief executive. ""This system can power more than 100 rural African homes for two days on a single full charge,"" he says, with the average daily consumption estimated at 0.49 kWh.
""[Ampersand] supply us with batteries at their end-of-life in their mobility and we use them in our second-life applications, then we extend the batteries' usable lifespan by repurposing them to stationary applications, Berwa says."" This creates the missing link for a sustainable adoption of electric mobility.""
More like this:
• Are China's swap stations the future of electric cars?
• Where EV batteries go to die – and be reborn
• 'A bullet train for power': China's ultra-high-voltage electricity grid
Rwanda is still far from its 100% mobility electrification plans, yet it has set the groundwork to lead Africa's energy resolution through off-grid and renewable energy sources, which according to Kama, will be the main driver of electric vehicles. ""Once this off-grid energy is scaled up, e-mobility will become pervasive. But it's not just about e-bikes or EVs, but also being able to power surrounding commercial activity,"" he says.
Rwanda's e-bike gamble is a bold experiment in an African context, where electric vehicles are choked by limited power grids. But novel solutions – from harnessing solar power to rapid battery swaps – offer a chance to bolster e-bikes' viability and contribute to wider electrification efforts across the country. The results of these strategies will deliver critical lessons for Rwanda, and may even shape the future of transportation across the developing world.

'Oasis of colour' planned for Eastbourne seafront,"The new array will be able to withstand warm and harsher coastal winds, according to its designer.",4 days ago,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wd607gq9qo,"Plans to restore Eastbourne's Carpet Gardens will begin on 12 May, 2025, with the aim of bringing greater biodiversity and removing invasive weed.
The garden will be divided into sections; one remaining planted with traditional, imported summer bedding plants and another seeing a new array, according to Lewes and Eastbourne Councils.
The work is expected to take six weeks and is lead by Sussex-based landscape and garden designer, Peter Thurman, who has worked at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens.
Councillor Jim Murray hopes the project will ""protect this Eastbourne gem for generations to come"" and provide an ""oasis of colour"".
The new array, which Lewes and Eastbourne Councils say can ""withstand the warmer and drier climate"", aims to provide a year-round display for visitors and wildlife.
Each section will be planted side-by-side, allowing residents and tourists to compare styles and give feedback to direct the future planting of the gardens.
The current bedding scheme has been in place for over 100 years, but has recently become overrun with an invasive, foreign weed called Oxalis latifolia.
The weed and contaminated soil will be removed without using harmful chemicals, according to Lewes and Eastbourne Councils.
Councillor Jim Murray says he is excited for the showcase once the renovations have been complete.
""We want to make sure that whether it's sustainable planting, the summer bedding, or a mix of both, we listen to the views of residents when planning,"" he said.
Gareth Jones, a trustee at Treebourne, says ""naturalistic planting"" has multiple benefits.
""[It] supports pollinators, conserves water and enriches soil health,"" Mr Jones added.
The design of the planned design of the flowers is meant to reflect the wave formations of the beach below, according to Mr Thurman.
""All the plants will withstand the harsh salt-laden winds and dry conditions that occur along the coast, and many provide nectar for insects and seeds for birds,"" Mr Thurman said.
Local primary schools are also expected to be invited to join the project by visiting the team on site; learning how gardening is affected by climate change.

Three artists to have Pride work displayed,A sculptor and two fashion designers are creating work on the theme of unapologetically visible.,6 days ago,Tyne,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj098292rvzo,"Three artists have been selected to have their work displayed during a city's Pride festival.
Sculptor Lady Kitt and fashion designers Christopher Niari and Sam Barley will have  their work showcased during Newcastle Pride 2025 and the city's first Pride Fringe Festival.
Each commission received a £2,500 development grant and was selected following a call out to local artists to create work on the theme of Unapologetically Visible.
Lady Kitt said the theme meant having ""the support, resources, care and community to remain visible even in the current climate"".
They said: ""With the funding, I plan to run workshops for local people on how to stay unapologetically visible in troubled times.
""Through this, attendees can share ideas which will be woven together to create an installation, which I hope offers a space for rest, connection and contemplation at this year's Newcastle Pride celebration.""
Lady Kitt said the grant would allow them to continue their research into how art can reduce stress for marginalised communities.
Niari and Barley are known for creating bold, custom pieces for drag artists. They plan to use the money to create new designs which will be unveiled during Pride Fringe Festival
""We really hope to put a spotlight directly on the talent within the fashion and design community within north-east England and really champion the queer excellence that runs deeply through it,"" Niari said.
The commissions were organised by Northern Pride in partnership with Creative Central NCL and Curious Arts.

Australia PM Albanese makes stunning comeback with landslide win,"Donald Trump loomed large over the election, with comparisons drawn between the US president and defeated opposition leader Peter Dutton.",3 May 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9djze015xlo,"Labor's Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called ""incumbency curse"" to be re-elected Australia's prime minister in a landslide.
Official vote counting won't finish for days, but Albanese's centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.
""Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need,"" Albanese said.
Coalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted ""full responsibility"" for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs.
Following the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.
Cost-of-living concerns - particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing - dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.
Dutton was seen by many as Australia's Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration.
Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told BBC Newshour that Dutton ran a ""very Trumpian campaign"", and the US president was ""the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived"" the Liberal-National opposition.
Labor saw swings towards them right across the country – a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia - and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.
The party's success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.
Labor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.
That represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most ""teal"" independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.
It's a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albanese's popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.
In his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the election's key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy.
He reiterated his promises to make healthcare - most critically GP appointments - more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.
Notably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: ""We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.""
It's a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albanese's tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.
Australia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.
The Voice was one of Albanese's most defining policies, and his most striking setback - it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.
Indigenous Australians have told the BBC  they feel like they've been forgotten by policymakers since.
The prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.
With tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the ""incumbency curse"" – a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.
Dutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback - he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.
It has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University  Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: ""Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.""
Instead tonight Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labor's Ali France.
""I love this country and have fought hard for it,"" he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.
""We have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.""
His campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameraman's head.
""The opposition has been shambolic,"" Prof Warhurst says.
But the government - while resolute and disciplined in its campaign - was timid. It's strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.
And that's something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.
While the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.
Last election, analysts and some of the party's own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton – a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man – was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.
After a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are ""Trumpian"" politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again – and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.
""We have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review... we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election,"" former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.
But meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.
Albanese's ""incumbency curse"" turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.
Labor struck a ""middle-of-the-road path"" with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.
""That was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: 'Will Labor actually do something with power?'"""
"Who is Mark Carney, Canada's new PM?","The former banker may not have held political office before, but has now been elected by the Canadian people.",29 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko,"The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, has won Canada's election to become the country's next prime minister.
He was sworn into the position last month after his predecessor resigned, but called for a snap election that saw Canadians head to the polls on Monday.
Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.
Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney had never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March, and has now been elected by the people.
He had touted his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.
Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.
With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.
The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.
In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.
""Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,"" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.
""These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.""
In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.
In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.
Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.
That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.
He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.
In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.
Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of ""forward guidance"", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.
Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an ""unreliable boyfriend"", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.
Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.
In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.
Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.
In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.
He described it as his ""toughest day"" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.
The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.
His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock ""should be temporary"".
Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.
From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.
He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.
Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.
After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.
""When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,"" Carney said.
""Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.""
He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs ""until the Americans show us respect … and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade"".
The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.
""Why don't I become a circus clown?"" he told a reporter in 2012.
Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.
Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.
Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.
""I know how to manage crises,"" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. ""In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.""
Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.
The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.
They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.
Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.
In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.
He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.
One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.
Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April, though he has in the past advocated for similar policies.
""This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,"" he said.
On the campaign trail, he has also advocated for making Canada a ""clean and conventional"" energy superpower, and to speed up major project approvals.
Carney has called himself a ""pragmatist"" when questioned about potential conflicts between his energy policies and his climate values.
On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.
His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US."

Ian Cooper said he planned to ""lift a few drains and see what comes out"".
He told BBC Radio Stoke if a service was not ""caring for the elderly and vulnerable, caring for or educating a child, fixing a pothole or cleaning a street"", the party would look at whether it was needed.
Reform UK made history in the county in the recent local election when it won 49 of the 62 seats and took control from the Conservatives.
The new council cabinet, made up of 10 senior positions, has also been announced.
Cabinet members, chosen from newly-elected Reform councillors, will be given responsibility for areas such as health and care, special educational needs (SEND) and highways.
The party has introduced a new cabinet role for community safety, which Cooper said would give the council more scrutiny over the police and Staffordshire's police commissioner.
When asked about the inexperience of the new cabinet in local government, he said they had, in his view, impressive life skills.
""You've got to look at the CVs of those people on the front benches,"" he said.
""We have more business talent, and more professional talent, than the front bench of the current government.""
On a visit to Staffordshire to congratulate his party's new councillors, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage branded the authority under the previous Conservative administration as ""very woke"".
He warned council workers involved in climate change policy or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policy ""it may be time to go and look for a different job"".
Responding to these comments, Cooper said climate change would be treated as a ""legal obligation to fulfil until that changes"".
His approach to DEI was a ""merit and ability"" recruitment process, he said.
Staffordshire's next leader may be a new name to many voters in the county, but he has a background in politics.
Formerly a Conservative, he worked as campaign director for veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke in the noughties. He left the Tory party in 2011 and joined Reform UK in 2022.
His background is in printing and he started his career as an apprentice in his hometown of Nottingham.
He lives in Tamworth, where he won his ward, Perrycrofts, and stood as the Reform UK parliamentary candidate in the 2023 by-election and 2024 general election, coming third in both.
Cooper will be formally made leader at the next full meeting of the local authority on May 22.

The people 'meadowscaping' their lawns,"Turning lawns into meadows can have big benefits for people, wildlife and the climate. Here's why 'meadowscaping' has become the latest gardening craze.",27 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250425-meadowscaping-the-people-turning-their-garden-lawns-into-wild-meadows,"Turning lawns into meadows can have big benefits for people, wildlife and the climate. Here's why 'meadowscaping' has become the latest gardening craze.
When Sara Weaner Cooper and her husband bought their first home in Pennsylvania, they knew they didn't want a perfectly manicured front lawn like their neighbours. They wanted something that was more than just turf – a flourishing, wild meadow home to diverse species of plants and animals.
It was a bold plan, to be sure, considering it involved overhauling their entire lawn when they were new to the neighbourhood. Thankfully, Weaner Cooper had ideal support for the project – her father is Larry Weaner, a renowned ecological landscape designer (she is now executive director of the educational arm of his design firm). The landscape design style he uses relies predominantly on native plants, she says, aiming to work with how they want to grow rather than forcing them into particular areas.
She grew up with a non-traditional garden curated by her father, which she remembers as a ""woodland wonderland"" because it was designed to support large trees. Today, it's still heavily wooded and teems with other native plants that prefer a shadier plot (his property gets less light than the Coopers'). Her father didn't plot it out or plant very much, she says, but did ""intentionally engage with it"", encouraging what it seemed to want to do.
Weaner Cooper had always wanted to focus on native plants in her lawn and do less mowing, so rewilding their front lawn felt like the right move. But the Coopers' lawn is a different animal than her father's. It's in full Sun and consisted of over 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) of turfgrass – narrow-leaved grasses designed to look uniform that had to be dealt with before a meadow could fully take over. Rather than rip everything up and live with a drab, brown lawn for months, they decided to try strategically seeding and planting native plants into the existing turf, hoping it would eventually weed the turf out naturally.
""It's easier in the sense that you don't need to be beating back as many weeds,"" explains Weaner Cooper. ""[The native plants] came in so thickly that [they] outcompeted a lot of the weed pressure that would have been there if we would have just made it brown.""
It took about two years, lots of planning, some careful weeding, and some trial and error, but eventually a medley of waist-high native plant species blanketed their vast front lawn.
""Meadowscaping"", or turning a traditional lawn into a meadow, is a burgeoning trend experts in the field are noticing, especially among younger generations who tend to be more climate-aware than their predecessors. Compared to lawns, meadows – open landscapes filled with an array of non-woody plants such as tall grasses, flowers and herbs – are less expensive to maintain, require less water and energy and help sequester more CO2. Most importantly, they also encourage biodiversity and they're typically more appealing to pollinators, which are keystone species on which ecosystems depend.
Climate change and habitat degradation are leading to major losses of native species in ecosystems worldwide, which in turn can disrupt how those ecosystems function. Meanwhile, lawns cover about 23% of the US's urban land areas and 70 to 75% of open green space in cities worldwide. The more people who rewild their lawns, the more significant the environmental impacts that could be seen, from lower pollution and stormwater runoff to a reduction in soil erosion and urban heat island effects, all while improving local biodiversity and soil and groundwater quality.
But meadowscaping isn't as simple as only locking your mower away (sorry, NoMoMay). There are methods to meadowscaping, and they aren't always the most intuitive, especially for beginners. To help others get started, Weaner Cooper's landscape design firm developed an online course taught by her father that walks interested parties through the steps, from interweaving aesthetics and ecology to addressing practical garden issues.
One of the most common questions from participants in the course, Weaner Cooper says, is, ""How should I handle my neighbours who might not appreciate how my meadow looks while it's in progress?""

She used a clever solution for her own property: a sign in her garden that reads ""native meadow in progress"". ""I put my email, and I was just, like, 'ask me questions,'"" she says. No one reached out directly, but cars sometimes stopped to take pictures.
In fact, Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states actively encouraging homeowners to transition their lawns to meadows. In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources started a lawn conversion programme that in some cases helps finance meadow projects.
""They cannot keep up with the demand,"" says Shishir Paudel, a plant ecologist at the Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""It started in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, and it [was] so successful that they expanded into western Pennsylvania last year.""
Paudel and his colleague Sarah States, director of research and science education at the Phipps Conservatory, spent the last six years studying the differences in environmental impacts between traditional and meadowed lawns. He hopes the metrics they collected will help convince more people to convert their lawns. But it's the financial disparity that he thinks may turn the most heads: as well as being cheaper to set up than a conventional lawn, a seeded meadow is far more affordable to maintain.
""You are likely to spend more than seven times more to manage one hectare of traditional lawn compared to meadow,"" says Paudel.
Maintaining a meadow also typically involves less work than regularly mowing a traditional lawn, but it's not completely hands off. ""Every couple of weeks in the peak season I go out and trim things back, or mow the paths through the meadow,"" says Weaner Cooper. ""And it looks very intentional.""
Still, meadowscaping doesn't have to look as wild as the Coopers' lawn. Take Marc Johnson's meadow in Toronto, Canada. A professor of biology at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, his research on how urban landscapes impact plant-pollinator interactions inspired him to create various pollinator gardens within his front yard (and label them accordingly).
Initially, his house had a ""pristine"" traditional lawn that the previous owner had maintained using lots of pesticides. Johnson did away with the pesticides and took a staged approach to his meadowscaping. Unlike the Coopers, he focused on creating specific smaller pollinator gardens within his yard. He also primed the lawn somewhat differently, clearing away much of the existing turf, putting down new soil, and then planting a large portion of native perennials, plants that come back year after year.
""And so, one garden at a time, we started to convert that space into pollinator gardens of different themes and flavours,"" says Johnson. ""We just gradually took up the entire lawn.""
Pollinator populations worldwide have declined precipitously over the last few decades. Monarch butterflies have been particularly impacted, and in just the last 20 years, the US has lost one-fifth of all its butterfly populations. But within the first year of his lawn conversion, Johnson says he began to see pollinators arriving to his flowering plants.
""You start to see pollinators that you have never seen in your yard before, and you didn't even know were in the area,"" he says. ""One of the favourites for the bees and the butterflies would be purple coneflower. It is a very hardy, easy-to-grow perennial that's very common in gardens. I'd say it's one of the best species for people to start with.""
Starting your own meadow
There are several ways to meadowscape a lawn, and what works on one property might not on another.
Still, experts agree you should aim for mostly native plant species (above 70% is often cited), with the ideal plants varying based on location. Johnson suggests finding a reputable nursery and asking them which are easy to grow and likely to come back.
He also recommends starting small. ""Even creating a diverse little garden on an apartment balcony can have an impact,"" he says.
If you're looking for a quicker turnaround, you can remove the lawn with natural lawn and weed killer, such as white vinegar, or pull it up and start from scratch, says Weaner Cooper. It's more intensive, and you'll have a brown lawn for a time, but it'll give your new native species more room and fresher soil to grow.
As the various gardens on his lawn grew taller, Johnson's neighbours began asking questions, mainly about how they could do the same on their properties, he says – and none complained about his lack of lawn. After about two years, the whole yard transformed into a patchwork quilt of gardens. One section is entirely dedicated to evening primroses, a plant of particular biological interest to Johnson.
Johnson describes his lawn as his own version of a national park. It's frequented by hummingbirds, endangered monarchs, and various species of bees, he says, which he even built a bee hotel for – although it's not intended to house honeybees, he says, which are not a native species in North America.
""[The holes in the wood] are for the more diverse and ecologically important solitary bees, most of which are native,"" Johnson explains. ""There are many different species that are nesting in there right now. And they are coexisting, although they are competing. It's not necessarily a happy time, but there is a lot of diversity in that one location.""
Johnson's yard certainly involves some upkeep, especially as he tries to maintain the themes of his specific gardens, but he also recognises its need to evolve. ""Every year is different because the species are competing. If something gets really abundant, sometimes a pathogen will come in and wipe it out, and then other things start to come in.""
This natural cycling of species is part of what makes meadows more resilient. Plant and animal species may compete from time to time, but that's an element of a healthy ecosystem that encourages natural selection and adaptation.
A recent study at King's College at the University of Cambridge in the UK, which measured the effects of rewilding half of the college's 300-year-old lawn, saw similar ecological benefits to meadowscaping. It found the meadow side was more climate resilient than the traditional side of the lawn, reflecting away 25% more sunlight, which helps protect the inhabitants from heat damage.
Plants typically found in meadows also tend to be more deep-rooted and, thus, more drought-tolerant. This makes them ideal for drier areas or those with limits to water consumption. What's more, their roots can help prevent stormwater runoff and even improve groundwater quality.
""In those diverse systems with the deep roots, [water] makes its way down into the bottom of the soil and then into the groundwater system,"" says Paudel. ""At the same time, it's filtered through [the vegetation] when it goes into the groundwater, so the water becomes fresher, less polluted.""
Xeriscaping, or meadowscaping with predominantly drought-tolerant plants, has been a water-saving practice in the American West for over 80 years. Government agencies that help landowners implement the practice have seen strong results: 18,000 properties in Southern Nevada, for example, saw an overall 30% reduction in annual water use and a 54% reduction in water costs after converting their turf landscapes to xeriscapes.
Similar plants can mitigate stormwater runoff, so Johnson planted some in a ditch on his property that was prone to flooding, creating a bioswale – a shallow trench designed to slow runoff with plants that help absorb the water into the ground.
More like this:
• Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear: How allergies are affecting animals
•  Resurrection plants: The drought-resistant 'zombie plants' that come back from the dead
• Elephants hate bees – here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers
""We put in plants that are especially adapted to wetlands but can also survive dry periods,"" he says.
The plants help stormwater runoff by rapidly sucking up water, both storing it in their leaves and using it for evapotranspiration, whereby plants release water to the atmosphere through the stomata in their leaves as they bring in CO2 for photosynthesis. ""When I put water at one end of the ditch, by the time it got to the right-hand side of that, most of the water is gone,"" says Johnson.
Large-scale bioswales are even being implemented in cities like New York City to reduce flooding from sewer overflows and stormwater, which can pollute nearby bodies of water.
Doing the heavy lifting (lawn turnover and initial planting) of meadowscaping is easier during the winter months, when most lawns are dormant anyway – a process called winter sowing. Melanie Rekola, a horticulturist and professional landscape designer in Canada, did just this.
""We scraped away all the sod with machinery, and then we put down a little bit of soil, and I got a 100% native wildflower mix and we spread it,"" she says. ""You spread it in the fall after a couple of frosts. Then all winter, those seeds get their cold stratification [exposure to cold, damp air that helps it germinate when it gets warm again] and the moisture they need, and then they come up in springtime, like they've always been there.""
As the Coopers demonstrated, however, you don't need to remove everything from your lawn to plant a meadow. Paudel suggests a process called solarisation, where you cover your lawn with clear plastic in the summer, which traps heat and kills the turf. ""In one week, grass will die, and then you plant, deliberately,"" he says.
Still, meadowscaping does have its limitations, one of the biggest being invasive species, which can overtake the native plants in a meadow if you don't keep an eye out for them. ""Keeping up with the weeding does take a little bit of time, like they don't know where the border of [a] garden is,"" says Johnson.
Meadowed lawns have been shown to have notable health benefits and may even reduce the amount of air and sound pollution that enters your home. Paudel says even roadside vegetation acts as a physical barrier and filter: ""Vegetation holds air particles. If you live roadside and have tall plants, less air pollution will enter your house."" Surrounding yourself with nature is also linked to reduced pain, improved cognitive function and restored attention and executive functioning in children and adolescents.
""It's a mental health booster. You look out your window in the spring, summer, fall, and almost every day, it's changing and it's beautiful,"" says Weaner Cooper.
And while it takes a fair amount of intentional curating, those who've rewilded their lawns seem to feel something beyond pride; rather more of a reverent stewardship of their local ecosystem.
""Imagine if half of an urban population took that view,"" says Johnson. ""We could dramatically change our ecosystems for the better, making cities much healthier environments.""

Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere,"The spacecraft, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, circled Earth for over five decades.",4 days ago,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vz28nyedo,"Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said.
Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades.
The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday.
It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere.
It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere.
While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage.
""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said.
Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure.
This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.
However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.
Mr Lemmens explained that the ""re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently"". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.
Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.
China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.
Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies.
Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft ""should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries"".
This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while ""managing the environmental impact of space debris""."
Miliband accuses net zero opponents of 'nonsense and lies',The energy secretary warns that an anti-net zero agenda could forfeit jobs in the future.,20 Apr 2025,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjn0pn830ko,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said the government will ""double down"" on its environmental agenda and accused those against the move to net zero of ""making up nonsense and lies"".
Political opponents in the Conservatives and Reform UK - and some trade unions – have argued that his agenda is putting jobs in traditional industries at risk and have urged a change of course.
The UK is legally committed to moving to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – a goal set under a previous Conservative government.
Writing in the Observer, Miliband warned that an anti-net zero agenda would not only risk ""climate breakdown"" but ""forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future"".
A green power transition will help secure social justice and national security, Miliband argued.
He said that the UK's reliance on fossil fuels meant ""markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed"" after Russia waged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
""The cost of living impacts caused back then still stalk families today,"" he said.
""So the argument for the clean energy transition is not just the traditional climate case but the social justice case too – it is working people who pay the greatest price for our energy insecurity.""
On his opponents, he said there are ""siren voices that want to knock us off course"" and added ""they will also make up any old nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda"".
Despite her party committing to net zero while in government, current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has said this cannot be achieved without potentially bankrupting the country.
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has criticised what he calls ""net-zero lunacy"",  told the Sun on Sunday that the policy could become ""the next Brexit – where Parliament is so hopelessly out of touch with the country"".
Miliband has been concerned that political opponents have been blaming his green policies for the well-publicised difficulties at British Steel, when in fact the trade body UK Steel has said high industrial energy costs are due to the price of gas, and not renewables.
The government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that its Chinese-owner Jingye was planning to switch the furnaces off.
Beijing has accused the government of ""politicising trade co-operation"" and said this situation had raised doubts about Chinese investment in the UK.
Parts of the labour movement, including unions such as the GMB and Unite, have warned of risks to thousands of well-paid jobs in the oil and gas sector.
But Miliband has attempted to reassure them by declaring that green energy generation will provide the good unionised jobs of the future."
How will Australia choose its next prime minister?,"The nation is voting for a new leader, against a backdrop of everything from the cost of living to Trump's tariffs.",3 May 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626e935llwo,"Australia's 2025 election began with a false start.
Everyone was poised and ready to go when a cyclone blew the government's preferred date – for April 12 – off course.
Instead, Albanese settled for a May 3 polling date with the firing gun finally fired in late March.
There have been announcements about health, vows to cut fuel tax and proposals from each side to fix the country's housing crisis – but as the campaign dragged on, both leaders struggled to compete for Australia's attention.
They had to contend with Donald Trump and his sweeping tariffs scheme for headlines, weave their campaigns around Easter, suspend them briefly to mark the Pope's death, only to revive them ahead of a long weekend most Australians would not have spent thinking about politics.
""It has been hard to cut through... but the major parties have lost the trust of the voters which has amplified their problems of communications,"" says John Warhurst, an Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University's School of Politics.
""The government has been timid and the opposition has been shambolic.""
So now, after five weeks of campaigning, Australia's 18 million citizens are facing a choice between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his rival Peter Dutton, both of whom may need to form the next government by securing the support of independent MPs or minor parties.
Here's everything you need to know about Australia's 2025 vote.
Australia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition.
The Labor Party's Anthony Albanese who has been the prime minister since 2022, is running for re-election.
A stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years, he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power. However, in recent times he has come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs, antisemitism and Islamophobia.
Albanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader.
Known as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.
Australians do not get to vote for the PM candidates themselves as there is no separate leadership ballot.  The leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House of Representatives becomes prime minister.
The cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters.
Since the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched.
The Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.
However, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management. That has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages.
Housing affordability will also be a key issue, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.
Australia's universal healthcare system, now struggling because of staff shortages and soaring costs, is another major concern for voters. Politicians across the spectrum admit there's a crisis, with many Australians delaying or skipping care - and both parties have promised billions in additional funding to fix it.
There are also global issues voters will consider, including the US President Donald Trump's tariffs, and his trade war with China.
Like many other nations, Australia has a close strategic alliance with the US while also maintaining a strong trading relationship with China. The country's new government will find itself dealing with a very different - and much more unpredictable - world order.
Australia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions.
Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18 and picking up a ""democracy sausage"" - a barbecued sausage typically served on bread and sold at polling booths - is an election day custom.
Australia uses a preferential voting system, where candidates are ranked in order of preference.
If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are redistributed, and that process is repeated until someone secures a majority.
In races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot in their area.
However, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences.
In this election, all 150 seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs, as well as 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate.
One party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.
If it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs.
Labor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception.
As it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.
But with one House seat abolished, Labor will be stripped of its majority in parliament if it loses just two seats.
In order to form a government in its own right, the coalition will need to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote.
In both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades.
That reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.
Once polls close, counting begins right away and results are updated in real time on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website - in what is known as an unofficial preliminary counting.
Historically, Australians will know who forms government on election night based off this – and the result will usually be called by media commentators, election experts or even the candidates themselves.
Official results can take days or even weeks to come, as the AEC has to go through a rigorous counting process, counting approximately 18 million ballot papers by hand, including postal and overseas ballot papers."
Moon dust 'rarer than gold' arrives in UK from China,First Moon samples collected in nearly 50 years and loaned by China for the first time are now in the UK.,6 days ago,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3krykxypo,"The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China.
The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them.
Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as ""more precious than gold dust"".
""Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,"" he says.
After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth.
Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.
China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons Rümker.
A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia.
It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race.
Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries.
The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe.
""It was almost like a parallel universe - and China is so far ahead of us in terms of their investment in space programmes,"" he said.
He returned to the UK with the precious cargo in the safest place he could think of - his hand luggage.
At his lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, we step onto sticky mats to clean our shoes and put on plastic gloves, gowns, hair nets and hoods.
The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination.
If Earthly material mixes with these extra-terrestrial specks, it could permanently ruin the analysis Prof Anand's team will do.

We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace.
Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom.
That is the Moon dust.
It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey.
And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total.
""Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,"" he adds.
In a lab down the corridor, technician Kay Knight will be the first person to actually work on the grains when the vials are opened.
She's been cutting and grinding pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface.
""I'm extremely excited,"" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade.
""But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,"" she adds.
After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs.
In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires.
Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases.
This is completely unique, and is one of the reasons Prof Anand believes his lab was chosen to receive the rare samples.
James Malley, a research technician, operates a machine that can work out how much oxygen is contained within the specs of dust.
He shows us a test run of what he will do.
""I'm going to hit that grain on the tray with a laser,"" he says, showing the scene magnified on a computer screen.
""It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,"" he says.
The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples.
But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission.
In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows.
""I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,"" says Prof Anand.
""A lot of us built our careers working on samples returned by Apollo missions, and I think this is a fantastic tradition to follow. I hope that other countries will follow suit,"" he adds.

Mayor sought legal advice after Reeves backed Heathrow expansion,"The move puts the London mayor on a potential collision course with ministers, after the chancellor backed plans for the expansion of the airport.",23 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygren9l6qo,"Sir Sadiq Khan has consulted lawyers over the government's plans for a third runway at Heathrow, which he opposes.
The move puts the mayor of London on a potential collision course with ministers in his own party, after the chancellor backed plans for the expansion of the airport in January.
Rachel Reeves said the airport expansion was vital for kickstarting economic growth and promised to ""stop blockers getting in the way of development"".
But Sir Sadiq, one of the most senior Labour figures outside of Westminster, has warned about the impact on noise, air pollution and climate change.
Plans to expand Heathrow's runway capacity were first proposed in 2006, but have been the subject of rows ever since.
Earlier this year, Reeves announced she was in favour of the expansion and said she hoped the new runway would be operational by 2035.
The chancellor's support for the project was first reported by Bloomberg News on 20 January.
Information released to BBC News under Freedom of Information laws reveals that Sir Sadiq's officials asked in-house lawyers for legal advice just two days later.
Legal advice was provided to the mayor on 24 January, but it's not known what his lawyers said.
The following week the London mayor said he would ""scrutinise carefully any new proposals"" but that he was ""simply not convinced"" the expansion could go ahead without damaging the environment.
A government source acknowledged there was some awkwardness around a senior Labour figure being involved in potential legal battles against government-backed plans, but said the mayor's move was neither surprising nor concerning.
They pointed to the length of time any expansion would take and said ""Sadiq probably won't be mayor of London by the time this comes to pass"".
Heathrow will submit initial plans for the expansion this summer, with a full proposal likely to follow in the months after.
That proposal would have to be approved by both the Planning Inspectorate and the transport secretary before work gets under way.
Any potential legal action from the mayor of London or others could only officially begin after those approvals.
In a speech to business leaders in January, Reeves said Heathrow expansion would ""make Britain the world's best connected place to do business"".
She said the airport was ""at the heart of the UK's openness"" and said a new runway would connect the country to emerging markets.
The chancellor told the BBC she wanted to get a planning application ""signed off"" before the next election and said the government was ""changing the rules to stop blockers getting in the way of development through excessive use"" of legal battles.
A spokesperson for Sir Sadiq refused to comment on legal advice but said he ""remains opposed to a new runway at Heathrow Airport because of the severe impact it will have on noise, air pollution and meeting our climate change targets"".
A government source said they would take steps to ""minimise the possibility of success"" for any legal efforts to block the expansion.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said expanding Heathrow would drive growth, trade and tourism, adding: ""Any proposals are assessed against the government's legal, carbon and environmental obligations.""
Heathrow Airport has been approached for comment."
Water firms admit sewage monitoring damaging public trust,The industry says powers to self-monitor water quality should be handed back to the regulator.,24 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxngw96qrgo,"Water companies should no longer be allowed to monitor their own levels of sewage pollution, the industry body has told the BBC exclusively.
Instead they are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to build consumer trust.
The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.
Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.
A third-party system could add more pressure to the regulators, which have also been criticised for not holding the companies to account.
A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.
David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: ""We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.""
As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as ""operator self monitoring"".
But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.
Southern Water was previously issued fines totalling £213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.
In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites which caused ""major environmental harm"" to wildlife.
The company later admitted its actions ""fell short"".
Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to ""reduce the administrative burden"" on the Environment Agency (EA).
In 2023, the BBC reported that EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.
The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system, calling it the equivalent of companies ""mark[ing] their own homework"".
But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.
""Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,"" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.
It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.
A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.""
The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.
Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.
The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.
""The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,"" said Henderson.
""This doesn't properly reflect the value of water and encourage people to conserve it in the way that we need,"" he added.

The images showing 50 years of change on Earth,"The ""Blue Marble"" was the first photo of the whole Earth and the only ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface.",22 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250422-how-50-years-of-climate-change-has-changed-the-face-of-the-blue-marble,"The ""Blue Marble"" was the first photograph of the whole Earth and the only one ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface.
""I'll tell you,"" said astronaut Harrison Schmitt as the Apollo 17 hurtled towards the Moon, ""if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now"".
It was Thursday 7 December 1972, that humanity got its first look at our planet as a whole. In that moment, the photograph ""The Blue Marble"" was taken – one which changed the way we saw our world.
""I can see the lights of southern California, Bob,"" said Schmitt to ground control about one and a half hours into the flight. ""Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens.""
The crew of the Apollo 17 – commander Eugene Cernan, command module pilot Ronald Evans and lunar module pilot Harrison ""Jack"" Schmitt – were watching their home recede into the distance as they journeyed into space for the last manned mission to the Moon.
Looking back towards the Earth, Cernan commented: ""the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque. Some in clockwise rotating fashion… but appear to be… very thin where you can… see through those clouds to the blue water below.""
It is an enduring image of the beauty but also the vulnerability of our planet – adrift as it is in the vastness of the Universe, which hosts no other signs of life that we have been able to detect to date. But ours is also a planet of great change. The tectonic movements that shift the landmasses move too slow for our eyes to notice. Yet another force – humanity itself – has been reshaping our planet at a pace that we can see. Urbanisation, deforestation, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are altering the way the Earth looks. So how, over the 50 years since that iconic image was taken, has the Blue Marble changed?
Those first images of the Blue Marble were taken by the crew, who passed the onboard camera – a hand-held analogue Hasselblad 500 EL loaded with 70mm Kodak film – between them, captivated by the sight of the Earth from space.
""All the images captured with Hasselblads are spectacularly clear and bright,"" says Jennifer Levasseur, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.
The camera was specially modified for use in space, she adds. Glues, lubricants, moving parts and batteries could all cause problems or fail when exposed to the extremes of hot and cold in space. It was also given a large square shutter-release button so the crew could use it while wearing their cumbersome spacesuits.
""The other major modification, was the removal of the viewing screen – because it's extra glass,"" Levasseur says, The astronauts, ""had to learn how to take pictures without being able to see anything"", she says. ""Without a viewfinder, you can't see what you're taking.""
Taking photos, says Levasseur, was planned meticulously and written into the mission plan. ""They had known previous launches wouldn't give them whole Earth, but on this one the whole Earth would be entirely illuminated by the light of the Sun.""
It was around five hours and 20 minutes into the flight that the crew got their first glimpse of the entire planet. The crew were starting to get ready for bed, zipping into their sleeping bags. It was their first moment of downtime since the launch.
""I suppose we're seeing as 100% full Earth as we'll ever see,"" said Cernan. ""Bob, it's these kind of views that stick with you forever… There's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.""
The Blue Marble image was captured at around 29,000km (18,000 miles) from Earth, as the Sun lit up the globe from behind the Apollo 17.
Almost six hours into the flight, Schmitt laughed. ""The problem with looking at the Earth, particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright,"" he said, ""And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular"".
Back home, it was nearing 05:00 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and ground control was quiet. ""I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?"" asked Schmitt. ""Just keep talking. We're listening,"" came the voice from the capsule communicator. And so the conversation continued long into the flight, the crew describing the clouds drifting over the ocean and the continents of home.
Previous Apollo missions had snapped the Earth partly hidden by shadow. The hugely influential, Earthrise, for instance, shows the planet as it rises behind the Moon. Up until this point, our view of home had been fragmented, with no real way to visualise the planet in its entirety. (Read more about how Earthrise sparked an environmental movement.)
Suddenly, glowing in the light of the Sun, the Earth was revealed as a beautiful shining blue orb, full of life and alone in the vastness of space. As a result, the Blue Marble is thought to have had more influence on humanity than any other photograph in history.
""If you can't see something, it's hard to visualise that it exists,"" says Nick Pepin, a climate scientist at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. ""I think all of us who have been brought up with that [image] from a young age probably find it difficult to imagine a time when we didn't know what the Earth looked like. This was the first time that we could actually look back from space and see our home – and people suddenly realised it was an amazing thing, but also a fixed system that we live on.""
The image offers a view of the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea area to the Antarctica South polar ice cap. Heavy cloud hangs over the Southern Hemisphere, and almost the entire coastline of Africa can be seen.
Nasa officially credits the image to the entire crew. We may never know which of them actually took it but today it is reported to be one of the most reproduced images of all time.
At 07.39 GMT on 7 December 2022 – 50 years later to the minute since the original was taken – a new ""Blue Marble"" was captured by a satellite orbiting a million miles away. This time, a set of 12 images taken 15 minutes apart, reveal noticeable changes to our planet's surface, the result of 50 years of global warming.
In the 50 years that separates these two snapshots in time, one of the most striking differences is the visible reduction in the size of the Antarctic ice sheet. ""You can see the shrinking cryosphere – the shrinking ice sheet and the loss of the snow,"" says Pepin says. This, he says, is a major indicator of climate change.
The Sahara Desert has also grown while the rainforest ""is retreating further south"", he adds. Research has shown that tree cover in the vast Sahel region that borders the Sahara Desert has been in significant decline. ""The dominant thing that you can see on the [new] image is deforestation and the loss of vegetation"", as the Earth's land cover switches from greenery to desert.
The pictures were taken by Nasa's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (Epic), which has been imaging the sunlit side of Earth between 13 and 22 times a day since 2015. The satellite sits at the first Lagrange point, a point of equilibrium between the Sun and Earth, a million miles from Earth.
From mid-April to mid-October, one photograph is taken of the Earth roughly every hour, and for the rest of the year it takes an image every two hours, says Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for Nasa's Deep Space Climate Observatory (Dscovr) satellite mission, which the camera is carried aboard.
""With respect to the Blue Marble, on the 50th anniversary, we decided to take the same images at 15 minute intervals. So, in 15 minutes [the Earth] rotates around maybe 100km (62 miles),"" says Marshak. And, thanks to advances in technology, he adds, ""we can see the same images, but with much better quality"", even from a million miles away.
More like this:
• 'Earthrise': The photo that sparked an environmental movement
• Out of this world: 11 spacewalks that made history
• What the planets aligning really means
""And we can see much more than that,"" Marshak adds. ""We take images in 10 wavelengths, from UV [ultraviolet] to near infrared. From these images we can retrieve the property of ozone, of clouds, of water. The height of clouds, the location of clouds. We can look at the property of aerosols, the size of particles, the amount of particles. We retrieve even the shape of ice crystals [in the clouds], using the Sun's glint. We can [see] whether they're horizontally or randomly oriented.""
""We retrieve [data on] the amount of leaves on Earth, and not only that but also the amount of leaves that are directly illuminated by the Sun,"" says Marshak. This data, combined with observations of ocean surface colour, can allow researchers to determine the rate of all photosynthetic activity on Earth.
The Dscovr programme hasn't been running long enough to draw any definitive conclusions, says Marshak, but they are starting to gather data that will provide new insights into how the world is changing – such as changes in cloud cover and height, reflectivity, and vegetation cover.
Among the other changes that have occurred since that first image of the entire Earth 50 years ago is the amount of human development and activity on our planet's surface. Although not visible in these images of the daylight side of the Earth, other satellites monitor for lights visible on the dark side of our planet. These show dramatic expansions in the urban sprawl across the continents alongside the activity of shipping on the Earth's oceans. Wildfires also glow across large swathes of the land at night, doubling in frequency in just the past 20 years.
Back in 1972, the Blue Marble prompted a mass-reconsideration of our place in the Universe. Astronauts viewing Earth from space have reported a profound feeling of awe, a sense of interconnectedness and environmental awareness, and of self-transcendence. This is called the ""overview effect"".
In the utter vastness of space, the beauty of Earth can be overwhelming. This feeling of intense awe has been found to elicit a fundamental change in thinking, a kind of cognitive realignment also called the ""need for accommodation"", as the person attempts to this process new perceptual information.
""Gobsmackingly – just – wow"" is how Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, described her first view of the Earth from space. It was 1991 and the 27-year-old chemist had just launched from Kazakhstan, to begin her journey to the Soviet Mir space station.
""We had two windows on the Soyuz spacecraft,"" she says. ""The commander, who sits in the middle, doesn't get a window. But the research cosmonaut, which was my job, and the flight engineer – we both had one. I had the right seat and flight engineer had the left seat. As we were launching, the spacecraft tipped my side very slightly towards the Earth. Immediately, the light streamed through that window.""
Sharman describes her view of the curvature of the Earth, the ""gorgeous blue seas"", white clouds, and black space above. The Earth, she says, appeared as if it had its own glow. ""The Sun was at quite a low angle, so it would reflect off the sea, and then back up to the clouds – and off the clouds underneath to the Earth. Then [the light] came up so it felt as though the Earth had its own light source.""
She compares the colour to the ""ultramarine of renaissance paintings"". ""It's quite unlike the rest of nature. It's that brightness against the blackness of space, you just see the Earth as this great big gorgeous blue dot.""
Then, as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness of space, the stars appeared in their billions. ""We know there are probably billions of stars just in one small section of the Milky Way, maybe even trillions. And we think maybe there could be up to a couple of trillion galaxies in the Universe. That [makes you] realise the insignificance of Earth.""
Sharman experienced these conflicting thoughts all at once. ""Our atmosphere is so thin. How easily that whole top layer, where most of life is, could just be wiped away."" But, conversely, she adds, ""Earth is not the focal point of the Universe.""
To this day Sharman dreams of ""floating along inside one of the modules and stopping by a window, looking out with the other crew"". The experience of viewing the Earth from space, she says, ""definitely changed my life's priorities"". ""The most important thing is the people. And of course, the environment and ecology that's required to keep this Earth going.""
The overview effect, say experts, is long-lasting and more powerful than other instances of awe. For the first time, the Blue Marble gave all of humanity the chance to experience the phenomenon to some degree. In fact, research shows that you can experience the overview effect with both feet firmly on the ground.
Like Earthrise, the Blue Marble image became an emblem of the environmental movement. It showed a planet requiring stewardship at the global scale.
The Blue Marble was used to illustrate the Gaia hypothesis, developed in the 1960s and '70s, which proposes that Earth and its biological systems act as a huge single entity, that exists in a delicate state of balance. And, although controversial among scientists, the theory kickstarted a holistic approach to Earth Science.
The image became a symbol of unity, too, as for the first time we could see the Earth without any human-imagined boundaries that divide us as they do on maps. The Blue Marble was adopted by activist groups like Friends of the Earth and events like Earth Day. Prior to this, environmental campaign images had often focused on pollution or endangered species.
The photograph appeared on postage stamps, and in the opening sequence of former US vice president Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, and inspired research into Earth systems with the establishment of climate research institutions such as the Max-Planck Institut, based in Munich, Germany.
Looking at the 1972 and 2022 Blue Marble images side-by-side, Pepin describes the Earth's ""restless atmosphere"". Visible in both images, are clouds formed above the green areas of rainforest, demonstrating the inextricable link between the forests and the rain. ""If you look at [central] Africa, you can see that most of the cloud, particularly on the earlier [image] is quite spotty, that indicates thunderstorms. Whereas if you go further north, and look at the Sahara desert, you can see there are no clouds.
""When you look from above you see all the connections, the overall relationships between areas,"" says Pepin. ""For example, Kilimanjaro rises from grassland, with snow on top. If you lived on the slopes you might not know there was snow on top and the importance of the connection between those areas.""
Looking at the Earth from space like this, he says, ""makes you appreciate the interlinkages between different parts of the ecosystems"". ""If you can only see your bit, you might think that environmental problems are only happening somewhere else and assume that 'it's not my problem',"" says Pepin.
However, the limitation, he says, is scale. ""You lose the detail. You need both. You need ground truthing [validating the information in the field] too.""
There is a ""huge fundamental difference"" between these two images though, says Levasseur. ""One is captured by a human – and one is not. It doesn't have the same impact. And that's really because of the fact that there's no person there.""
Levasseur is looking forward to the photographs that will be brought home from the next manned mission to go as far as the Moon: Artemis II, planned for 2026. ""There's not going to be another whole Earth image in the way I think of it until humans go out away from Earth again. I wasn't alive in 1972. This is going to be a huge moment to know that people are looking at us from that far away.""
""As much as we like to think of satellites as sort of our surrogates,"" she says, ""I know that there is a person behind that camera, so there is something different about it, and there always will be.""

Power plant bosses concerned as subsidy cuts loom,"Cotesbach Landfill Gas Project, near Rugby, traps methane and uses it to generate green energy.",24 hrs ago,Coventry & Warwickshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861q2gld1xo,"Bosses of a biogas power plant in Warwickshire say they are worried about its future after the government revealed subsidies for the industry are to be axed.
Cotesbach Landfill Gas Project, near Rugby, traps methane from rotting organic rubbish in landfill and uses it to generate green energy.
David Rice, managing director of Melton CLP - which runs the site - said that when the renewable energy subsidy is withdrawn in 2027, it will force 87% of sites like this plant to ""close overnight"".
The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it was exploring options to support the sector meeting net zero targets as well as addressing the interests of bill-payers.
""Electricity produced from landfill gas generators plays an important role in increasing our energy security, while turning off the tap of future methane emissions and helping deliver net zero,"" it added.
Melton CLP also runs 18 other sites and said that each year the gas they capture would power about 90,000 homes across the country.
""Not only would you lose the benefit of the renewable energy that comes from them, but also you'd see an increase in methane emissions across the UK,"" said Mr Rice.
Paul Cleary, who owns the plant near Rugby, explained that he and his team mine for pockets of methane emitting from the waste.
Methane is generated by a number of things, including garden waste, kitchen scraps and nappies.
The gas is extracted and used to power large engines that, in turn, generate green electricity.
He told the BBC the plant's work was important.
""If we weren't here and you had the waste inside a landfill site, the methane would build in pressure and it would start to smell,"" he said.
""It would obviously create environment issues if no-one was here doing what we do.""
Outside the industry, others are also concerned.
Liam Hardy, head of research at environmental charity Green Alliance, said the UK was signed up to several treaties promising to reduce methane emissions, and this industry was a vital part of doing that.
He told the BBC that if the industry collapsed because of the move by the government, it would be a ""disaster"" for climate change.
""Because it's also really short-lived in the atmosphere, actually tackling methane emissions can have an immediate effect,"" he said.
""We should be thinking of action on methane as the emergency brake on climate change.""

Activists say ship aiming to sail to Gaza was attacked by drones,"The incident happened off the coast of Malta. The government said a fire onboard the ship was ""brought under control overnight"".",2 May 2025,Middle East,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27z0r8n5do,"Activists who were planning to sail a ship to Gaza say it was struck by drones in international waters off the coast of Malta - appearing to accuse Israel of being behind the attack.
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said its ship The Conscience was targeted at 00:23 local time on Friday and issued an SOS signal right after the attack.
The BBC was sent a recording of the distress call from the flotilla ship, recorded by a crew member on a nearby oil tanker. The captain of the flotilla ship can clearly be heard reporting drone strikes and a fire onboard.
The Maltese government said everyone aboard the ship was ""confirmed safe"" and that a fire onboard the ship was ""brought under control overnight"".
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said it had planned to sail to Gaza with people including climate activist Greta Thunberg on board and ""challenge Israel's illegal siege and blockade"".
The NGO called for Israeli ambassadors to be summoned to answer for ""violation of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel"".
The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the attack.
Organisers told the BBC that the group had been ""operating in total secrecy with a complete media blackout"" to prevent ""sabotage"" as they prepared to sail towards Gaza - where about two million Palestinians have been under a complete blockade by the Israeli military for two months.
Volunteer Surya McEwen said he and others had lost contact with the ship after the incident, which he said caused a fire on board and damaged the hull. They had since been told there were no major injuries.
""It's a full-on situation for them but they're recovering,"" he told the BBC, adding that the incident had been an ""unprovoked attack on a civilian vessel in international waters, trying to do a humanitarian mission"".
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was among those who had planned to board the ship once it departed for Gaza on Friday.
Speaking to journalists in Valetta, she said: ""I was part of the group who was supposed to board that boat today to continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.""
Thunberg added that as far as she's aware, the ship is still at the location of the attack because moving it would let too much water in.
""What is certain is that we human rights activists will continue to do everything in our power to do our part, to demand a free Palestine and demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor,"" she said.
The Maltese government said that 12 crew and four activists were on board the boat, while the NGO said 30 activists had been on board.
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition uploaded a video showing a fire on the ship. It said the attack appeared to have targeted the generator, which left the ship without power and at risk of sinking.
The Maltese government said a tugboat was sent to the scene to extinguish the fire, which they say was under control by 01:28 local time.
""By 2:13, all crew were confirmed safe but refused to board the tug,"" the statement said, adding the ship remains outside territorial waters.
Cyprus responded to the SOS signal by dispatching a vessel, the activists said, but that it did not ""provide the critical electrical support needed"".
Marine tracking software shows that the Conscience left Tunisia on Tuesday evening and is currently around 12-14 nautical miles off Malta.
The coalition is campaigning to end Israel's blockade of Gaza, which is also facing mounting international condemnation. Last month the UK, French and German foreign ministers described the Israeli decision to block aid as ""intolerable"".
Two months ago, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza – preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and later resumed its military offensive, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
Some humanitarian organisations such as the World Food Programme say they have already run out of food while community kitchens say their stocks are dwindling fast. On Friday the Red Cross said the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the verge of ""total collapse"".
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,418 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

The seawall being built in Japan's turtle haven,Locals and ecologists are troubled by the potential impacts a looming seawall could have on the biodiverse Japanese island of Amami Ōshima.,1 day ago,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250512-how-a-concrete-seawall-split-this-japanese-island-village,"Some locals and ecologists are troubled by the potential impacts a looming seawall could have on the biodiverse Japanese island of Amami Ōshima. So is there another way to protect its beach?
Rising before dawn on an early summer day in July 2022, Hisami Take took a walk along Katoku beach in Amami Ōshima, an island nestled in the far south of Japan. Looking along the beach, she saw an animal track on the sand stretching from the ocean, then U-turning back into the water.
The track, she says, likely belonged to an endangered loggerhead sea turtle that is known to come ashore to lay eggs. ""This year, no eggs were found. Maybe the shiny orange construction rope is signalling the turtles to turn away.""
Take, a 49-year-old Amami resident, and many other locals on the island fear that an enormous concrete seawall about to be constructed on the beach in place of the rope could make such tracks more common by blocking endangered species like the turtle from coming to the beach.
The construction firm did not respond to a request for comment. The local authority, Kagoshima Prefecture, responded to say that construction work was proceeding with consideration for the natural environment, and would not be carried out in the coastal area during the turtles' egg-laying season. It noted it had not been confirmed that the ropes on the beach affected turtle behaviour.
Opinion on the years-long development has split the local community. Scientists and many locals worry the seawall could immovably obstruct the already threatened wildlife of the biodiverse island and argue that natural solutions such as planting local species would provide better protection from coastal erosion. Advocates of the seawall, meanwhile, say it's necessary to give both people and local land vital protection from coastal erosion and typhoons, with some seeing it as welcome infrastructure development.
It's a debate that goes to the heart of how coastal communities will respond to rising seas and more intense storms due to climate change. Hard coastal protection measures like concrete seawalls have been implemented in some areas of the world for decades, but many scientists now favour natural defences, which aim to improve local ecosystems to bolster resilience. When the two are in competition, which wins out?
With its white beaches and beautiful coral reefs, Amami Ōshima is widely known for its candid natural beauty. While it makes up only 0.5% of Japan's land, much of it is a biodiversity hotspot: it is home to 95 globally endangered species, 75 of them endemic, and over 1,800 species of plants. In July 2021, a part of Amami Oshima, together with sites on three neighbouring islands, was registered as a Unesco World Heritage Site for its outstanding ecological significance.
Amami retains many of its rich forests and mangroves, but Katoku is its last coastal village without concrete defences and with a free-flowing river. The area is home to endangered species such as the leatherback turtle, which has lived since before the dinosaur extinction, and the Amami rabbit, an ancient species sometimes referred to as a ""living fossil"".
""I could not believe a place like this existed in Amami – so mystical and almost divine,"" says Take, recalling her first visit to Katoku when she was 19. ""Growing up in Amami, I never had a 'real' beach around. All the other beaches and rivers [on Amami Ōshima island] were hardened with concrete, but Katoku still has a beach, a river delta where freshwater flows freely from the Katoku mountains and a dynamic sand dune.""
Now, though, an enormous seawall is being constructed at the beach by Kagoshima Prefecture. It says it is building the wall, which will be 180m (590ft) long and 6.5m (21ft) high, ""for the safety and security of lives and assets of residents from coastal erosion caused by natural disasters such as typhoons"".
The decision to build the seawall was taken in response to concerns raised by local residents back in 2014. They submitted a request to the local Setouchi town council that governs Katoku village to take measures to prevent what they believed to be dune erosion caused by two typhoons that year. They were concerned such erosion could endanger an ancestral resting place, central to their religious tradition, which lies some 70m (230ft) above the waterline. However, they did not specifically request a seawall as the solution.
The project saw final approval by the Kagoshima Prefecture in January 2018, but in the meantime other local residents have come together to oppose the seawall, arguing it is in danger of disrupting the Katoku River, affecting the entire rare beach ecosystem. In September 2020, a petition with more than 30,000 signatures was submitted to the governor of Kagoshima, mayor of Setouchi town and Setouchi town council, urging for construction to be reconsidered. Scientists, environmental groups and residents say they have also submitted appeals to the Kagoshima Prefecture to reconsider the construction and hold open discussions with residents. Several told the BBC they did not receive a response.
The Kagoshima Prefecture said it was working to post information on its website to improve public understanding of its approach. It added that the Setouchi Office did provide a verbal response to petitioners, explaining that the project was started in response to requests from Setouchi Town and local villages for its early completion. It said that the decision to build a seawall and plant pandanus trees was reached after many discussions among a committee composed of experts in coastal, aquatic organisms and the environment, as well as local residents. The prefecture said it ""decided to proceed with the development in order to protect the lives and property of local residents"".
Meanwhile, in 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the official advisor on nature under the World Heritage Convention, designated the local Katoku River and neighbouring beach areas as a buffer zone. The designation means these areas are legally protected by the Japanese government.
The IUCN noted the seawall construction would continue, but its report included a statement from the Japanese government saying the seawall would be ""far from the mouth of the Katoku River"" to avoid any negative impacts on the river. Environmental monitoring would be continued after construction to watch for any unexpected impacts too, it said.
Construction started the following year, in February 2022, but locals say it appears to have been halted several times since, as well as disrupted by sit-ins by local protestors. It restarted again in July 2024 and is now in the final stages of building a road to allow work to start on the seawall. Even as construction is beginning, however, a legal case in opposition to the seawall is ongoing at the Japanese Supreme Court.
Filed in 2018, the plaintiffs consist of locals and the Japan Environmental Lawyers Federation (Jelf), who argue that Kagoshima Prefecture is misusing public funds by pushing ahead with the project. They contend the wall is unnecessary and will not help with any sand dune erosion if indeed there is any. Kagoshima Prefecture contest the allegations, arguing that the construction is necessary to protect the village from coastal erosion caused due to natural disasters such as typhoons, and asserting that the project follows proper procedures and legal standards. The prefecture added that it was continuing to work with the IUCN through various legal and other procedures.
Separately, some are concerned that the seawall is being built in a more problematic location than environmental overviews of the project first indicated – closer to the river mouth, risking its ecosystem and biodiversity.
After a request from the Jelf lawyers and NGO Save Katoku, Coastal Engineering Laboratory, an independent research team based in Tokyo, investigated the concerns around the impact of the seawall on the local ecosystem. In a September 2024 letter sent to Save Katoku and its defending lawyers and seen by the BBC, it concluded that the seawall is indeed set to be constructed ""within"" the river channel of the Katoku River. Coastal Engineering Laboratory told the BBC that it has not received any financial assistance from any of the parties involved in the legal case.
Kagoshima Prefecture noted that ""depending on the season, sea sand may block the estuary due to the influence of waves, and at that time, water that has nowhere to go may meander and flow along the beach"". It said that the seawall was planned in the position where the original sand dunes used to be, away from the meandering flow of water along the beach front, and not obstructing it.
""At some points of the year, the river's mouth – the entire beach – shifts seasonally, which means that the river can flow across the sand and reach right where the seawall is planned, for about six months,"" says Jean-Marc Takaki, head of the local non-profit Save Katoku says. ""This contradicts the government's own promise of building the wall far away… among many things it disrupts the natural meandering of the river and the whole sand process of the beach essential to maintaining the ecosystem."" The BBC contacted Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport but did not receive a comment by the time of publication.
Takaki is calling for an Unesco Reactive Monitoring mission to investigate these concerns and provide recommendations to ensure the protection and conservation of the river.
Locals also express concern about their lack of involvement in the decision-making process of the seawall. The Kagoshima Prefecture conducted surveys, including environmental studies, and three rounds of expert meetings from 2016-18, but Takaaki Kagohashi, a lawyer and longtime member of Jelf involved in the court case, says local residents were not consulted, except for the then-village-chief.
Kagoshima Prefecture underlined that its review committee of experts and local people is held in an open format and views are widely solicited on its website.
Shigeo Sakae, the current village chief of Katoku since April 2023, was not aware of the details of the seawall project. ""I was asked by the prefecture if I support a construction that protects the residents, so I said yes,"" he says. Katoku, he adds, is the only village on the island that has not yet built any hard coastal structures until this seawall project. ""All other villages have already completed their construction, but we are the only ones who haven't had anything done for us.""
Kamata Naruhito, the mayor of Setouchi town, says projects like the seawall are needed to revitalise the economy. ""Amami Oshima island has been recognised as a natural heritage site, so it is something very important that we must cherish and pass on to the next generation,"" he says. ""However, alongside that… public works projects are also necessary with the support of the central government.""
With intensifying typhoons and rising sea levels around the world, the tensions over the Katoku beach seawall will not be the last debate to emerge over the best way to protect local communities from flooding and coastal erosion.
Seawalls have long been considered a primary solution for coastal protection, particularly against storm surges and erosion. Hard coastal protection measures such as dikes, embankments, seawalls and surge barriers are now widespread, providing predictable levels of safety in many coastal cities and deltas around the world, according to a 2019 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
More like this:
• Where EV batteries go to die – and be reborn
• What we've learned about cleaning up major oil spills since Deepwater Horizon
• The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery
But these measures can come with a heavy cost both economically and environmentally, says Satoko Seino, associate professor at the department of ecological engineering at Kyushu University, Japan, who studies coastal seafloors.
""Concrete seawalls not only demand heavy investment but also incur ongoing maintenance costs,"" says Seino. Kominato beach, which lies next to Katoku on Amami Ōshima, once shared a similar landscape with a pristine sand beach supporting both human and wildlife. With construction projects including renovation and reconstruction of breakwaters, embankments, wharves, boat ramps, roads and land development totalling some 5.32 billion yen (£27m/ $34m) since the 1970s, parts of Kominato beach are now littered with neglected concrete.
Edward Atkin, director of eCoast Marine Consulting and Research in New Zealand, has studied Kominato beach and compared it with Katoku. In a 2021 assessment, he concluded that the Kominato seawalls exacerbated erosion and shortened the beach width, while the seawall itself has also been eroded by sea water. He noted that both Kominato and Katoku beaches had the same ""pocket beach"" structure, where the beach holds a closed off and highly sensitive sand system that moves around under different wave conditions.
Since around the 2000s, and especially in Europe and North America, there has been a shift in coastal management towards the use of eco-engineering and nature-based solutions – ways of working with natural ecosystems to address environmental challenges, says Seino. ""These approaches integrate natural systems which not only protect against storm surges but also preserve biodiversity,"" she says.
In areas where natural ecosystems like dunes and mangroves offer protection, experts frequently recommend nature-based solutions as more sustainable options, according to the IPCC. This chimes with research which shows that nature-focused solutions to societal challenges more widely often provide economic and social benefits.
In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has similarly encouraged the use of ""living shorelines"", an approach that uses ""green infrastructure"" such as plants and sand rather than concrete or rock to defend coastlines. Research has shown this method is effective at protecting against erosion and storm surges and can even be more resilient than bulkheads in protecting against the effects of hurricanes, while also providing other benefits such as soaking up nutrient pollution and supporting fish habitat.
Amendments to Japan's Seacoast Law in 1999 aimed to implement more sustainable coastal management and conservation plans, but progress has been slow, says Seino. ""Once people see concrete hardening as the answer, it's difficult to change that mindset."" The BBC contacted Japan's Ministry of the Environment but received no comment.
Since 2018, Japan's environment ministry has also been promoting an ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) initiative, an approach to disaster prevention which aims to also build a sustainable, safe and affluent society living in harmony with nature. In a letter to the IUCN on 8 November 2019, the Japanese government said an ""eco-friendly"" seawall would be built at Katoku beach, covering concrete embankments with sand and plants, presenting the project as a nature-friendly Eco-DRR initiative.
""Nice try, but it doesn't work like that,"" says Wesley Crile, a coastal dune restoration specialist at the University of Hawaii who has led on multiple community-based dune restoration projects on Maui Island in Hawaii.
Maui Island has a similar sand dune system and vegetation, including pandanus trees and morning glories, to Katoku. Crile highlights how the community uses natural processes instead of concrete structures to prevent coastal erosion.
""For example, morning glories, which are present both in Maui and Amami, can trap wind-blown sand with their cup-shaped leaves, gradually building up dunes,"" Crile says. If a storm takes some sand from the dune, the dune shape will be affected on the surface, he adds. ""But when the storm subsides, the sand process will restart and the dune can be rebuilt with time."" Japan's Ministry of the Environment did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Seino's coastal seafloor studies have similarly led her to support a natural dune restoration process at Katoku. Healthy beaches have a ""natural ability"" to recover, even if they are temporarily eroded, she says.
""It's like when a person falls and gets a scrape or a bruise – while it may look serious on the surface, their overall vitality isn't compromised,"" she says. ""Similarly, such a coastline remains resilient. Even if the surface layer of sand is completely stripped away, it will eventually come back. As long as the dune is in a healthy state, it will function as a natural seawall, basically.
In Katoku, planting projects led by volunteers and locals have taken place several times since 2015, before the seawall was approved. Planting of pandanus trees and morning glories – both also indigenous to Amami – mirrors the restoration initiatives in Hawaii that utilise the inherent regenerative power of coastal dunes.
""The area in front of the cemetery is now flourishing with tall pandanus trees, and the once-severe erosion has disappeared,"" says 90-year-old Hiroaki Sono, who has lived on the island for most of his life and leads the non-profit Environmental Network Amami. However, he adds, the long-term sand movements and characteristics of the beach should be studied ""more closely"" before any decision is made on how best to protect the habitat. Kagoshima Prefecture did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Local collaboration is a crucial part of implementing nature-based solutions, adds Naoshi Nagae, a conservationist and the head of the local Amami Nature School, who focuses on environmental education by leveraging the knowledge of locals. For example, as pandanus trees take time to grow, it is better to use transplants of young trees rather than seeds, he says. ""Ideally, these trees should come from the same village, or at least a neighbouring one, to avoid invasive species.""

The debate over the two proposed solutions to save Katoku Beach – building the seawall or restoring the natural sand dune through planting of local species – has sparked an ongoing conflict among the community at Amami. ""This seawall controversy is not just about nature and people's lives, it's a barrier dividing us,"" says Takaki.
Eriko Minayoshi, a traditional folk singer, has been part of a long-running sit-in protest against the construction. ""At the site, no one is offering any real explanation,"" she says. ""All they say is, 'You are blocking business, get out of the way.' Every day feels like an emotional weight. Even in my sleep, I am haunted by images of construction."" She has also begun to feel the toll of the protest on her body, she says. The construction firm did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Take believes that an open dialogue between the residents and the authorities is essential to finding solutions. ""Deep down, I know that everyone shares the same wish to protect the beach,"" she says. ""We need to work together to discuss and find what is truly best for everyone, for our Katoku beach.""

Birdwatchers' control tower disguise at Heathrow,A shelter for birdwatchers near Heathrow has been designed to look like an air traffic control tower.,30 Apr 2025,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz95l9gv745o,"A new shelter to allow watchers to observe birds at close quarters near Heathrow has been designed to look like an air traffic control tower.
Called a bird hide, it allows enthusiasts to watch wildlife at a nature reserve on land owned by the west London airport.
Heathrow said its 13 nature reserves were home to 79 bird species, including kingfishers and barn owls, as well as rare spiders and butterflies.
But a local MP says if Heathrow is serious about protecting and promoting biodiversity, ""it could start by taking its plans for a third runway off the table"".
The installation of the bird hide is part of an attempt by Heathrow to raise awareness of its nature plan, which it says ""outlines how the airport will better understand and reduce its impact on ecosystems"".
This includes expanding the amount of land the airport manages for conservation.
Munira Wilson, Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham, told BBC London: ""We welcome all initiatives that Heathrow and any other organisation takes to improve biodiversity and encourage people to take an interest in nature.
""But at the end of the day, as things stand, Heathrow wants to build a third runway.
""The Climate Change Committee and various experts have said there is no way that Heathrow will be able to meet its climate change commitments - ultimately, that's going to be very bad for our biodiversity.""
In January, the government announced its backing for an expansion of Heathrow as part of its plans for growing the economy.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she wanted to see ""spades in the ground"" in the current Parliament and for planes to start using a new third runway by 2035.
Heathrow said it had invested £250m in carbon and sustainability projects since 2022.
Rosie Howell, head of sustainable strategy at the airport, spoke to BBC London at the site of the new bird hide.
She said: ""We're located in a community and we can manage land in a way that benefits nature and the people that live around us.
""We're in a beautiful, natural spot that can co-exist with an airport that's on its doorstep.
""What we've done is to look at the land we have and to acquire extra land around the airport to make sure we can benefit biodiversity at the same time as operating here.""

Can this lynx born in a zoo learn to live in the wild?,It has been moved to Germany's Black Forest in preparation for its release,2 May 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8074ry1yr5o,"As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest.
A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.
Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.
But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.
It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.
This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.
Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.
""I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,"" he said. "" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.""
Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.
Though not officially classed as a ""big cat"" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.
Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.
""Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,"" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.
It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.
The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.
""Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,"" Dina says.
To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.
But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.
So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.
""Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,"" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.
Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.
""If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,"" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us.
We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.
There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign.
""Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,"" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.
The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.
""Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals."" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.
""We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.""
The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.

Public inquiry into huge solar farm to begin,"The £800m solar farm would cover 1,000 hectares of Oxford countryside.",1 day ago,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071e40yreko,"A public inquiry into plans to build one of Europe's largest solar farms begins on Tuesday.
For the next three days, open floor hearings will take place as part of the Planning Inspectorate's examination of the controversial Botley West scheme in Oxford.
The £800m farm would cover 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of countryside north of Woodstock, west of Kidlington and west of Botley.
It is considered a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, meaning the application must be considered by the government, not local councils.
The plan has split opinion, with developer Photo Vault Development Partners saying large-scale solar energy is crucial to meet the UK's climate targets, while local politicians and opponents calling it a cause of concern.
Campaigners also want Blenheim Palace, which owns 90% of the land, to use its influence to press for 2% of the project's annual revenue, instead of the proposed 0.2%, to be allocated to benefit local communities.
Blenheim Palace said: ""As we lend our land to this project we do so knowing it could deliver enough clean energy to power 330,000 homes, helping Oxfordshire's homes to be self-sufficient, whilst supporting our collective declarations in the battle against the climate emergency.""
It added it knew the arguments both for and against the development and it did not think those were ""exclusive of one another"".
Social enterprise The Low Carbon Hub has been running the Make Botley West Solar Farm Fair campaign, which is focused on ensuring the project delivers ""real and lasting benefits to the local communities that will host it"".
It said it had estimated in the first year 2% of revenue would create £840,000 in community benefit, but it added until the project was up and running it was ""very difficult"" to know the precise figure.
""Our proposed 2% of revenue model ensures communities receive a fair and proportionate benefit, one that is tied to the actual performance of the project – if that does well, then communities also benefit,"" it said.
West Oxfordshire District Council has previously said the scale of the solar park had ""potential for significant and widespread positive and negative impacts"".
As part of the planning process, relevant parties, including the local authorities in which the development sits, can submit their response to the plans.

Bilingual poetry book encourages writing in Welsh,"A bilingual collection of poems celebrating Wales' rivers gives Welsh and English ""equal weight"".",8 days ago,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkglkerp01o,"A new bilingual collection of poems celebrating Wales' rivers gives Welsh and English ""equal weight"" to encourage poets to write in their first language.
Fifty poets from Wales each write about specific waterways in rural as well as urban settings which are of particular significance to them in the collection named Afonydd, Welsh for rivers.
Some poems examine childhood memories, pollution or climate change, while in others the river is symbolic for the Welsh language, representing change.
Every poem is translated either from Welsh to English, or English to Welsh, Publisher Arachne Press said.
The publisher said it had been inspired by the success of its best-selling bilingual collection of poems: A470: Poems for the Road /Cerddi'r Ffordd.
The collection featured poems focusing on the impact of Wales' main artery from north to south, with poets reflecting on memories of the journeys they made along the road or its impact on the landscape.
""We were very aware that although great fun as a theme, a book about a road wasn't the most eco message we could send out,"" Arachne Press director Cherry Potts said.
""The advantage rivers had as a theme, is that in Wales in particular it is really inclusive, and poets could write about almost anything in connection to a river.""
For Afonydd: Poems for Welsh Rivers /Cerddi Afonydd Cymru, the publisher chose 50 poems from over 400 entries in response to an open call.
Each poem is published side by side with its translation either from, or into, Welsh, and the language the poem arrived in dictates which goes on the left page.
""We wanted to give Welsh equal weight. There is an ingrained assumption that to reach a big audience, poetry from Welsh poets must be in English,"" Ms Potts said.
""Because we wanted to encourage this group of poets to explore their first language, their mamiaith, we adopted the approach that whichever language the poem arrived in,  we would translate, or help the poet translate.""
Poet Natasha Gauthier, whose poem The Severn at Llanidloes is featured in Afonydd, said she was intrigued by the idea that the river Severn, ""transforms from a Welsh river into an English one, 'bends the knee' and gradually loses its Welshness, its identity"".
The Québecoise Canadian writer living in Cardiff grew up in Montreal, ""in a culture that has fought for its language and identity and is proud of that fight"", she said.
""So the idea of how Welsh survives against a 'rising tide' of English is a familiar concept to me,"" she said.
She is learning Welsh and while she submitted her poem in English, she said she loved the Welsh translation.
""The poet Christopher Meredith mentioned to me that 'hallt' (for 'salty English') in Welsh can also mean something that stings, that costs you dearly - his Welsh-speaking mother would use it to describe something expensive,"" she said.
""So I very much like that double meaning.""
Lesley James, whose poem Afon Lash Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness is also featured in the book, said a river can be an indicator of the social, economic and environmental health of a village.
She said she has fond memories of the River Lash, close to where she grew up in west Wales, but that she was ""astonished"" to recently find out it was among the most heavily polluted rivers in the United Kingdom.
Ms James also said the ""amalgamation"" of English and Welsh in the book ""can only have a positive effect"" on efforts to promote Welsh language.
""It is how most of us speak when we come from that part of the world,"" she said."
Mosquitoes in Scotland as far north as Shetland,The extent of Scotland's mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.,1 May 2025,"NE, Orkney & Shetland",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq59r8x7ro,"A Scottish summer is synonymous with the humble yet pesky midge.
But Glasgow University scientists have confirmed the continued rise of its distant cousin - the mosquito.
The country is now home to more than 20 different species of the biting insect, and some have been identified in Shetland - the most northern location to date.
More commonly associated with tropical climes, mosquitoes are a natural part of the Scottish ecosystem.
The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.
University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.
Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.
Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.
After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.
While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.
The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.
Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as ""tremendous"".
She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.
""In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.""
In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.
Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.
She said: ""There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits – understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.
""We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes – proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.
""Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.""
Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.
However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.
It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.
Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.
Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.
The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.
The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.
Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.
You can get involved in the project and submit your own sightings by visiting the Mosquito Scotland website."
Renewable energy's trouble with 'wind theft',"As wind farms expand, some can accidentally ""steal"" each others' wind – causing worries over some countries' energy transition to net zero.",7 days ago,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250506-renewable-energys-trouble-with-wind-theft,"As wind farms expand, some can accidentally ""steal"" each others' wind – causing worries over some countries' energy transition to net zero.
As offshore wind farms are expanding around the world in the race to meet net zero climate targets, a worrying phenomenon is attracting growing attention: in some conditions, wind farms can ""steal"" each other's wind.
""Wind farms produce energy, and that energy is extracted from the air. And the extraction of energy from the air comes with a reduction of the wind speed,"" says Peter Baas, a research scientist at Whiffle, a Dutch company specialising in renewable energy and weather forecasting. The wind is slower behind each turbine within the wind farm than in front of it, and also behind the wind farm as a whole, compared with in front of it, he explains. ""This is called the wake effect.""
Simply put, as the spinning turbines of a wind farm take energy from the wind, they create a wake and slow the wind beyond the wind farm. This wake can stretch more than 100km (62 miles) for very large, dense offshore wind farms, under certain weather conditions. (Though more typically, the wakes extend for tens of kilometres, according to researchers). If the wind farm is built upwind of another wind farm, it can reduce the downwind producer's energy output by as much as 10% or more, studies suggest.
Colloquially, the phenomenon is known as wind theft – though as Eirik Finserås, a Norwegian lawyer specialising in offshore wind energy, notes: ""The term wind theft is a bit misleading because you can't steal something that can't be owned – and nobody owns the wind.""
Still, he points out that the phenomenon can have a number of negative consequences for wind farm developers, and even, potentially, cause problems across borders (more on this later). There are in fact a number of ongoing disputes between wind farm developers over alleged wind theft, raising concerns in countries that rely on ramping up offshore wind energy to meet their net zero climate targets.
While the problem of wind theft has been long known in principle, it is growing more pressing due to the scale and speed of the offshore expansion, and the size and density of offshore wind farms, experts say.
In the North Sea, which is seeing an offshore wind boom, the impact of such wakes on offshore energy production is likely to increase in the next decades as the sea becomes more crowded with wind farms, according to simulations by Baas together with researchers from the Delft University of Technology and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The denser and bigger the wind farm, the stronger the wake effect, Baas says.
A new research project in the UK, launched this spring, aims to provide a clearer picture of the wake effect to help governments and developers improve their planning, and avoid disputes. The project will model wakes and their impact on wind farms' output in 2030, when there will be thousands more turbines in UK waters than today, says project lead Pablo Ouro, a research fellow in civil engineering at the University of Manchester.
""We have seen wake effects for years, and knew they happen,"" says Ouro. ""The problem is that in order to achieve net zero, we need to deploy a given amount of offshore wind capacity. So for 2030, we need to have three times more capacity than we have now, which means that in less than five years, we need to deploy thousands more turbines,"" he explains.
""[Some of] these turbines are going to be operating very close to those that are already operating, so things are getting more and more crowded. So these wake effects are now starting to have more impact,"" he says.
The UK government has pledged that by 2030, Britain will generate enough power from renewable sources, such as wind, to cover its electricity needs. A 2025 UK government policy paper highlights the need to better understand wake effects in this context, describing them as an emerging issue that creates uncertainty for offshore wind farms.
Currently, there are a number of disputes in the UK between offshore wind farm developers over potential wake effects, Ouro says. In his view, these disputes are partly caused by uncertainty over the precise impact of wakes. For example, current UK guidelines on how much offshore wind farms should be spaced apart to avoid wake effects, may not reflect the actual extent the wakes can reach, he says. Also, because offshore wind farms are built in clusters, it can be difficult to assess how they might all affect each others' energy output, he explains.
""When you have two wind farms, it's very simple to assess that wind farm A is interacting this much with wind farm B, and vice versa. But what if you have six wind farms, how do they interact with each other? That's what we don't know – but it's going to be happening for sure,"" as more and more wind farms are built, Ouro says.
""The other issue is that turbines are getting very big,"" he notes. Turbines have been growing taller and their blades getting larger to capture more energy from the wind. The latest turbines have blades that can span more than 100m (328ft), the length of a football pitch. Among the biggest offshore turbines, a single one can power around 18,000 to 20,000 average European households. But this increase in size could worsen the wake effect since a bigger rotor diameter may create a longer wake, Ouro says, adding that more research should be done to understand the impact.
Finserås led a study of wind wakes and regulatory gaps while undertaking doctoral research at the University of Bergen in Norway. The study analyses how the wake of a planned wind farm in Norway could negatively affect a downwind farm in Denmark. Finserås warns that unless the problem of managing wake effects is addressed, it could result in legal and political conflicts and make it harder to invest in wind energy.
""The North Sea and particularly the Baltic Sea, in Europe at least, will likely be a hub for a massive-scale build-out of offshore wind farms,"" Finserås says. ""So this issue of wake effects will very likely permeate the energy transition in the North Sea, and elsewhere.""
From an investment perspective, even relatively small wake effects can cause problems for offshore developers, Finserås says. ""There are huge costs to building an offshore wind farm,"" he explains, due to the sheer scale of these farms as well as all the complex related work, including deploying special-purpose vessels. To justify their investment and make a profit, ""it's very important for a developer to be able to project that the wind farm will produce a given amount of electricity for 25 or 30 years"", the typical lifespan of a wind farm, he says. Even a relatively small, unexpected reduction in that energy output can upset this investment calculation and make the wind farm not financially viable, Finserås says.
If operators or countries try to avoid these wake effects by securing the best spots for themselves, it can create another risk, he warns: wake effects may cause what's known as ""the 'race to the water' phenomenon, whereby states rush development in order to reap benefits from the best-yet available wind resources"". Rushing development could then increase the risk of ignoring other important aspects of wind farm planning, such as protecting the marine environment, he says.
Ouro, at the University of Manchester, also sees a growing risk of cross-border problems: ""All the disagreements that are filed to date [in the UK] are between UK wind farms, but what if tomorrow there's a dispute between a UK wind farm and a Dutch, Belgian or French wind farm? So, the sooner we anticipate this situation, and lay the groundwork for: 'Ok, that's how we're going to address this,' the better. It reduces uncertainty and is much better for the industry.""
Finserås recommends European countries address the problem of wind theft by cooperating and consulting with one another when planning wind farms, as well as introducing clear regulations that help manage wind as a shared resource. Essentially, wind could be treated like other shared marine resources for which there is regulation, such as oil deposits that cross state boundaries, or fish, he suggests. ""It's not like [states] haven't regulated similar issues before,"" he says.
To tackle these thorny issues, it's helpful that the European countries involved generally have good political relations, says Finserås.
""We have to decarbonise energy sectors, and we have to do so very quickly, that's the ambition of the European Union when it comes to offshore wind policies,"" he says. ""So there's no question that all of this is happening very quickly. But we shouldn't be prevented from finding good solutions just because things are happening quickly."" After all, he says, it's in nobody's interest to fight over the wind. ""There is an incentive to cooperate to find equitable solutions between states, despite the fact that [the wind energy expansion] is going ahead at full speed.""
It's not only Europe that's racing to better understand wake effects. China, for example, is rapidly expanding its offshore wind farms, and researchers there have cast a spotlight on the growing impact of wake effects on Chinese offshore wind farms.
Since the project was announced in March, Ouro has been flooded with emails from people interested in it, which in his view shows just how urgent the issue is. ""We need to understand this, we need to progress more on the modelling, so everyone is confident, because we need this amount of offshore wind to get to net zero. We have to deliver this.""

Net zero 'doomed' and royals 'on love island',Tony Blair's speaks out about energy policy and the Prince and Princess of Wales head to the Isle of Mull.,30 Apr 2025,The Papers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dekx9nw54o,"According to The i Paper, Sir Tony Blair has blown a hole in Labour's net-zero plans with his criticism of current approaches to tackling climate change. The Daily Telegraph calls it a ""significant intervention"". A Labour source quoted by The Times has a different interpretation, describing the comments as ""a public tantrum"". The paper itself says the former prime minister's remarks are the latest sign that the mainstream consensus on green policies is collapsing.
The Guardian, citing an unnamed source, says US President Donald Trump has made a trade deal with the UK a ""second order priority"", which will hamper British attempts to reach an agreement by the middle of next month. There is no comment from the White House. The Financial Times reports that a surge in imports by American firms in March, ahead of the new tariff regime, has led economists to ""slash"" their growth forecasts for the US.
The Mirror leads with a call to action from a mother-of-four in Gaza with its headline ""our children are starving"". Its front page shows a picture of destroyed buildings and Palestinians queueing for aid. The story is based on testimony from within Gaza secured by Save the Childen.
In its main story, the Daily Mail says it can reveal that Scotland Yard's cyber crime unit has been called in to investigate what the paper calls the ""devastating IT meltdown"" at Marks and Spencer. The paper says a group suspected of carrying out the hack is believed to be made up of thousands of teenagers from the UK and US.
The Daily Express focuses on the legal challenge by a transgender former judge to the Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman. ""Women's battle for safe spaces goes on"" reads its headline. The report says Victoria McCloud is preparing to fight the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, while noting she has the backing of the British Medical Association. It quotes the gender critical academic, Kathleen Stock, who calls Dr McCloud a ""moron"".
The Sun devotes its front page to a photo of the Prince and Catherine, Princess of Wales, known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay when in Scotland, beaming during a trip to Mull for their 14th wedding anniversary. ""Wills and Kate on Love Island"" says the headline.

Weight loss jabs 'at the chemist' and 'hottest' May,Weight-loss injections will be available over the counter and a heatwave arrives in the UK.,2 May 2025,The Papers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgny57kj3eo,"The Daily Mail says NHS patients will soon be able to get weight-loss jabs for the price of a prescription - less than £10.
It says that under a pilot scheme, people will need only a short, over-the-counter consultation - but it warns about blowing what it calls a ""doughnut-sized hole"" in the NHS budget.
The Daily Telegraph says the rollout of the jabs has been slow until now, because it has been handled by GPs, and the aim of the new scheme is to make it faster. It says the trial is part of ""Britain's war on obesity"".
The Financial Times says the removal of Mike Waltz as US President Donald Trump's national security adviser was partly because the Maga movement, which stands for Make America Great Again, had turned against him.
It says they felt he was out of step with the president, as he was too willing to use US power overseas. The Times describes Trump's decision as the first significant firing of his second term.
The decision by the Football Association to bar trans women from the women's game is welcomed by The Sun, which says it has ""seen sense at last"". Its editorial says the FA has ""shown the red card to the gender madness infecting sport"".
The Mail argues the footballing governing body should apologise for its previous policy, but the Daily Mirror quotes one campaigner saying trans women will now turn their back on the game entirely.
The Guardian says nine big banks have poured more than £75bn into companies developing huge oil, gas and coal schemes in recent years.
The group which published the figures, which campaigns against fossil fuels, says it's ""astonishing"" how much money flows from the UK to what it calls ""climate-wrecking"" projects.
And it wouldn't be Britain if the papers weren't excited by a burst of warm weather. ""Hot, hot, hot"" is the headline in the Daily Star, while the front page of the Daily Mirror says the country ""sizzled in a May scorcher"".
The Sun goes for ""record baker"", while the Telegraph fills much of its front page with a striking aerial photo of bathers at an open air pool in Hampshire - but adds that temperatures will be cooler over the bank holiday weekend.

Insect tower installed to boost nationwide research,The tower is part of a nationwide project using insects to study the effects of climate change.,20 Apr 2025,Shropshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2039r9g8zo,"A new tower has been installed at a university as part of a nationwide research project using insects to study the effects of climate change.
The 12m-high (39 feet) tower at Harper Adams University, near Newport, in Shropshire,  is designed to collect insects as they pass over its top.
Information about the various species collected is being sent on to Rothamstead Research in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.
The resulting data can be used to help farmers know about possible pest movements as well as to examine seasonal changes in insect populations and movement, said the university.
The tower is the latest in a series of new installations gathering data about the insects on the campus - with a moth trap installed in February 2024.
Professor of applied entomology at the university Tom Pope said: ""Most species of aphid are not pests of crops and so data on the timing of migrations and numbers of aphids provides a valuable resource in studying effects of climate change.""
Nikoletta Foskolou from the university's entomology group added with the tower installed the team were now preparing to collect samples to be sent for identification.

Campaigners challenge Luton Airport expansion plan,The government is accused of ignoring advice to reject the plans over environmental concerns.,7 days ago,"Beds, Herts & Bucks",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx4x8jwqd7o,"Campaigners against the proposed expansion of London Luton Airport have begun the first steps of legal action against the government.
The Luton and District Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (LADACAN) claimed the development consent order, approved last month, was granted unlawfully.
It alleged that Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander ignored the recommendation by planning inspectors that the expansion gets rejected due to environmental concerns.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said it was unable to comment due to ""ongoing legal proceedings"". Last month, Alexander said expansion would ""deliver significant economic benefits"" which was ""a key reason for my decision"".
LADACAN said it had sent a pre-action protocol letter to the secretary of state informing her of its intention for a judicial review.
A judicial review is a type of court case in which a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision or action made by a public body.
LADACAN said it had appointed a law firm and called on the government ""to accept that the decision was unlawful"".
It claimed the potential impact on climate change and ways in which it would be mitigated had not been fully assessed.
Andrew Lambourne, the organisation's chair, added: ""Everyone can see the worsening effects of climate change, and it's obvious that the damage it causes comes with huge costs.
""This in turn harms the UK economy, which suggests that the government should be dampening demand for carbon-intensive activities such as frequent flying, rather than encouraging it.""
Plans to expand London Luton Airport involve building a new terminal, new taxiways and almost doubling annual passenger numbers to 32 million by 2043.
When the plans were approved, a spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the decision would help to ""deliver growth"".
Luton Rising, the airport's owner which is owned by Luton Borough Council, said the expansion could bring ""significant economic, employment and social benefits"" to the town.
In regards to legal action, a Luton Rising spokesperson said: ""Luton Rising has received a copy of the pre-action protocol letter that was submitted to the secretary of state on behalf of LADACAN, and we are considering the grounds of challenge and determining our response and involvement in the legal case.""
Luton was the UK's fifth busiest airport last year, with 16.9 million people travelling on 132,000 flights.
Luton Rising said expanding the site could create up to 11,000 jobs.
LADACAN said it expected the secretary of state to respond to its letter in the coming days.

'Our club was living on a week-to-week basis',"Grassroots football generates over £1bn a year in London, but many clubs are struggling with costs.",2 days ago,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v29q9e8v3o,"""We were pretty much living on a week-to-week basis,"" says Paul Loding, captain and chairman of a grassroots football team in south-east London.
""It was expensive to rent the pitch, which was poor quality. Having to find a referee that you've got to pay for, even supplying kits and footballs. It is too much without adequate funding.""
Grassroots football generates more than £1bn a year to London yet many clubs say they are lacking sufficient funds to support their activities.
According to a survey conducted last year by Net World Sports, 70% of grassroots clubs across England and Wales were struggling to make ends meet.
There are 950 grassroots football clubs in the capital, which make up about 5,500 teams. They engage approximately 70,000 registered players including 30,000 youth participants and 650 players with disabilities, according to the London Football Association (FA).
The organisation estimates that they bring in a combined £605m in adult social care value and £105m in youth social value, along with the £1bn in direct economic value.
Mr Loding said his team, which began in 2006 as London Romans, used to rely heavily on player contributions to stay afloat.
However, in 2020 the LGBTQ+ inclusive football club partnered with Millwall Community Trust and is now known as Millwall Romans FC.
""The cost of everything has gone up so much in the last few years and we are now in a really lucky position that we do have the backing of Millwall,"" Mr Loding said.
""Providing a grassroots club is nearly impossible with the costs involved.""
The collaboration provides essential support, including access to better facilities and resources such as the use of Millwall FC kits and home ground.
The club trains twice a week at St Paul's Sports Ground in Rotherhithe.
Beyond the pitch, it engages with local schools and participates in events like London Pride to build community engagement.
Rising pitch rental costs have strained other grassroots clubs' resources too.
Paul Bickerton, CEO of London FA, believes collective action is needed to support the sport.
""The big challenge that clubs come back to me with all the time is accessibility of facilities,"" Mr Bickerton said.
""Getting the right facility at the right time, and then the cost of it, that's undoubtedly the barrier.""
The London FA's strategy for 2024 to 2028, titled London For All, aims to enhance grassroots football across the capital.
Objectives include developing and improving facilities, and boosting playing choice and experience.
""We've got a target by 2028 to get nine new 3G [third generation grass] facilities in, and we're making good progress against that target,"" Mr Bickerton said.
The strategy also focuses on building a network of volunteers, coaches, and referees to support the game's infrastructure.
The London FA hopes the strategy marks a step forward in tackling the challenges facing grassroots football in the capital.

Birmingham Pride in political parties parade ban,"Organisers say Labour, the only party booked to march at the parade, was being told it could not do so.",29 Apr 2025,Birmingham & Black Country,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1epp3v3zo,"Some political parties have been banned from Birmingham's Pride parade, with organisers citing what they call a lack of support in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling.
Judges in the UK's top court concluded this month a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.
Birmingham Pride said it had ""growing concerns about the role political parties have played in fuelling a climate of hostility toward trans+ individuals"".
Organisers of the annual LGBT+ festival added Labour, the only party booked to march at the parade on 24 May, was being informed it cannot do so. Labour said it would ""continue to protect the trans community"", adding laws to protect trans people remained.
Many groups have welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, however others have said it leaves trans people feeling ""very alone"".
The ruling received a mixed response from political parties.
Birmingham Pride said the parade was full and was not taking further applications, but added: ""The position is clear, any political parties supportive of trans rights would be welcomed and those that don't are not.""
Eva Echo, Birmingham Pride's director of innovation, said: ""The trans+ community is still ignored by politicians at local and national level. For too long we've been talked over, used for political gain and forced to watch as our rights are stripped away, and our existence twisted beyond recognition.""
She added: ""Those who do not fully commit themselves to supporting and protecting us throughout the year, do not have a place with us during Pride, just because it suits them.""
The two-day festival, one of the UK's biggest LGBT+ events, said it had growing concerns over promoting ""exclusionary interpretations"" of the Equality Act following the Supreme Court ruling.
Interim guidance over the use of single-sex spaces, in light of the Supreme Court ruling, said trans women should not use women's facilities, but should not be left without any facilities to use.
The Supreme Court had been asked to provide clarity on the 2010 Equality Act.
A campaign group had brought the case, arguing that sex-based protections for women should only apply to those who are born female.
Ultimately the court backed that position, but in the ruling Judge Lord Hodge said the law still offered trans people protection against discrimination.
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"", and added that the Equality Act protects trans people from discrimination.
The Green Party has called for the guidance to be withdrawn, calling it ""ill-considered and impractical"".
The Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey supported the ruling but said more debate was required in parliament to ensure people's rights are respected.
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the ruling was an ""outbreak of common sense from our judiciary.""
Birmingham Pride's decision follows Belfast and Southampton pride events in excluding political parties from taking part in marches.
Birmingham Pride added it was in ""active conversations"" with other prides across the country to ensure ""a united stance in support of trans+ rights"".

Labour said everyone in society deserved ""dignity and respect"".
""The Supreme Court judgement gives clarity and confidence for service providers,"" a  party spokesperson said.
""We are aware that many trans people will be worried in the wake of the ruling, and we remain clear that we will continue to protect the trans community.
""The laws to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment will remain in place, and trans people will still be protected on the basis of gender reassignment—a protected characteristic written into Labour's Equality Act."""
New scheme to care for police force's 250 dogs,"The scheme, announced for West Midlands Police, aims to enhance the welfare provision of the dogs.",5 days ago,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2el0m4jj9o,"A new animal welfare volunteer scheme has been launched as part of protecting police dogs working for West Midlands Police.
The project, announced by West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Simon Foster, aims to ensure the highest standards of care and welfare for the force's 250 police dogs.
It consists of independent volunteers, including vets and dog experts, who will inspect the force's dog kennels, training methods, vehicles and breeding programmes.
Welfare of police dogs became of particular concern in 2018 after an incident regarding another force, when a West Mercia Police dog died of heatstroke, after being taken ill in a force vehicle with a faulty fan in Worcester.
""West Midlands Police dogs serve our communities and help to keep us safe. The care and welfare of our working dogs is therefore of utmost importance,"" Mr Foster said.
The move demonstrated the force's commitment to ""accountability, transparency and the highest standards of care and welfare for our dogs"", and encouraged people to join the volunteer team, he added.
On the day West Mercia dog Ivy died in Worcester, in July 2018, temperatures reached 26C (78.8F) before she was found unresponsive in a ""climate-controlled police vehicle"".
Her handler had been attending a training session, while Ivy remained within the climate controlled pod with another dog in the back of the police vehicle.
Because of the hot day, the vehicle's engine was left running to allow the air conditioning to work.
However, a review, carried out by Staffordshire Police, found an extractor fan in the vehicle was malfunctioning.
The report stated that Ivy was left unchecked for two hours.
Speaking about the initiative volunteer Mark Doggett, who works for Guide Dogs UK as a training behaviour specialist, said: ""We'll be looking at and monitoring the welfare of police dogs, where we'll go out to training days and where dogs are deployed from, making checks to see that high standards are met.
""It's important because if the welfare of the dogs is at an optimum, West Midlands Police will get the most out of them and it's only right they're cared for properly as working dogs.""
Chief Constable Craig Guildford said the dog unit was an ""essential part of our force"".
""It is vital that we look after these incredible animals,"" he said.
""The Animal Welfare Volunteer Team will help us maintain the highest standards of care and ensure that our dogs are well-treated and well-trained to serve our community effectively.""

Peru kidnapping leaves 13 dead in gold mine,Miners were kidnapped and killed in a Peruvian gold mine after a confrontation with a criminal gang.,5 May 2025,Latin America,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3vdw5ek9qo,"Thirteen miners have been found dead inside a mine in Peru after being kidnapped several days earlier.
They were working at a gold mine owned by Peruvian mining company Poderosa, which is based in Pataz province, north of the capital Lima.
The victims had been sent out to confront a group of people involved in illegal mining in the area, but were kidnapped by a criminal gang which was trying to gain control of the mine.
The gang kept them hostage inside a mine shaft. For a week, they sent threatening messages to the miners' relatives.
There has been a spike in criminals attacking mines in the country in the past few years.
On Friday, the company - which employs 8,000 people - released a statement saying it was disappointed that the police were not doing enough to prevent illegal mining.
""The climate of violence continues to escalate in the region,"" the company said.
Peruvian news site Diario Correo reported that a video spread on social media -  allegedly recorded by the captors themselves - showed the miners had been executed at point-blank range.
It is not clear what prompted them to kill the group.
Since 2020, illegal mining has taken over several mines run by Poderosa, forcing them to abandon some operations and ""putting the physical safety of our employees and the artisanal miners at risk,"" the company said.
In March, criminals working alongside illegal miners near La Ciénaga ravine in the Pataz district attacked contractors at the mine, killing two people.
The same month the company also said illegal miners blew up a high-voltage tower supplying power to the mines and tried to ""invade"" several mine sites. Poderosa said the police and army were unable to take control, and called on the government to restore order.
The company said illegal mining and organised crime were able to operate with ""absolute impunity"".
Peru is one of the world's largest gold producers, mining more than 100 tonnes a year - or about 4% of the entire world's annual supply."

Solar 'part of food security solution' - developer,Concerns have been raised about turning agricultural land over to solar panels in the county.,30 Apr 2025,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x1321xp5o,"A project manager behind plans for one of the UK's largest solar farms said such developments were ""part of the solution"" to improving food security.
If approved, the High Grove Solar Farm would span 4,000 acres (1,619 hectares) across five sites near Swaffham and Dereham in Norfolk.
Concerns have been raised about the loss of good agricultural land to solar panels – and how that could impact food production in the UK.
But Michael Greslow, from the site's developers – RWE – said the biggest threat to farmland was climate change and that ""projects like High Grove solar farm are here to fight [it]"".
""Defra's own reports are clear on that, with wetter winters and extreme heats there's already lower yields affecting crops and degrading soil quality"" he added.
High Grove would cover an area the equivalent of 2,267 football pitches and should generate enough energy to power 363,000 homes.
It is one of several major solar farms which could be built in Norfolk, with a smaller development near Reepham given approval last week.
The government is keen for such developments to be put forward, with the aim of tackling climate change and making the UK less reliant on foreign energy.
However, solar farms are often controversial, with MPs from opposing parties calling for locals' concerns about High Grove to be listened to.
Conservative MP George Freeman said it would have ""massive repercussions"" for the area and he had formed ""an alliance"" with Labour's Terry Jermy to work with representatives from the area.
Freeman, who represents Mid Norfolk, said the development would directly affect 19 towns and villages with the site's infrastructure of solar panels, sub stations, pylons and cables dispersed ""across such a vast area"".
The former science minister added that while he supported ""the transition to renewable energy"" he ""long opposed the loss of productive farmland"".
Jermy, the South West Norfolk MP, said he had spoken to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband about his concerns that more solar farms were proposed for Norfolk than other parts of the UK.
""Renewable energy does not fall evenly across the country – in Norfolk we are flat – it's easy to get solar panels into the ground. We are disproportionately being impacted by solar farms,"" Jermy said.
Mr Greslow said RWE had made revisions to its initial proposals following feedback and had begun its next stage of consultation.
He said that further archaeological and environmental surveys would also take place and ""there will certainly be refinements before we lock in a final layout"".
The government is expected to make its planning decision on High Grove in 2027.
Miliband has said he is ""considering"" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy.

Council to spend £2.5m on making homes greener,Herefordshire Council says nearly a fifth of households in the county are living in fuel poverty.,24 Apr 2025,Hereford & Worcester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn91e99yp09o,"A council is planning to spend nearly £2.5m to make 200 households more energy-efficient and sustainable over the next three years.
Herefordshire Council has been given £2,485,440 from the government's Warm Homes: Local Grant scheme, which means it will spend an average of about £12,400 on each property.
The local authority said that fuel poverty remained ""a significant issue in Herefordshire"", affecting nearly one in five households compared to nearly one in eight nationally.
It added that while there would be no initial outlay from householders, they would be responsible for maintaining installed systems.
Broken and inefficient heating systems will be replaced with renewable air source heat pump systems, and wall insulation, double glazing and insulated doors will be installed.
The work, which will be carried out by the council's current contractors, could also extend to loft and underfloor insulation as well as solar panels.
To qualify, households need a low Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of D to G – which is thought to apply to more than half of all Herefordshire households. Park homes, which are not EPC-rated, are also covered.
Residents' combined gross annual income can be no more than £36,000.
The council said a combination of ""low incomes, above-average numbers of older, hard-to-treat properties and poor coverage of the mains gas network"" meant many people were living with less cost-effective and less sustainable heating systems.
The spending would also help it meet its goal of becoming a carbon-neutral council by 2030, it added.

Project aims to return 'keystone' elk to UK,"Experts say a major challenge was getting the public used to the idea that elk ""should be here"".",2 days ago,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2e7834yko,"Wildlife experts are ""very excited"" at the prospect of bringing back elk to the East Midlands - and to the UK - for the first time in about 3,000 years.
The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured £15,000 of funding from the Rewilding Britain charity to begin feasibility studies into their return.
The animals are regarded as ""keystone"" species which can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species.
Janice Bradley, from Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust (NWT), said one of the major challenges was getting the public used to the idea that elk ""should be here"".
European elk were originally widespread in Britain but were hunted to extinction in the Neolithic era.
Ms Bradley, head of nature recovery (north), said: ""They are one of our lost species.
""They used to roam all over the place, through lots of different habitats, throughout the UK.
""They would have roamed through the wetlands of the Trent, in and out of reed beds and pools, woods and grasslands, so they are native and were lost due to hunting, probably by Neolithic people, and we think they should be brought back to fulfil their role in optimising habitats for other wildlife.""
The new funding will pay for a disease risk assessment, to study whether reintroduced elk would bring infections to existing livestock or vice versa.
Ms Bradley thinks the successful reintroduction of beavers could be a good guide to the new project.
""We consulted with 2,000 households to say what was going on,"" she said.
""We would intend to do the same with elk, to inform residents and let them know what we are doing.
""But also helpfully get people excited and engaged.
""And engaging with landowners is very, very important part of any of the next steps.
""One of the first challenges is getting people used to the idea these animals are native to this country and they should be back here.""
The average Eurasian elk - along with the American moose to which it is closely related – stands between 1.4m to 2.1m (4ft 7in and 6ft 11in) high at the shoulder and can weigh from 380kg to 700 kg (838 to 1,543 lb).
Does Ms Bradley believe such animals can be brought back to the UK and allowed into the wild?
""Initially our elk and beavers would be in the same enclosure, bringing them back together in the UK for the first time in 3,000 years,"" she said.
""But because elk prefer to be in those big, complex wetland habitats, eventually we would be looking at elk along the Trent valley.
""They would very much stay in those habitats, they wouldn't be roaming across roads like deer,  but that's a very long way away yet.
""But I'd like to see them sooner rather than later.""

Inside the Arctic vault holding back-ups of great works,"An arctic vault holds digital back-ups of some of humanity's great works of art, history and technology.",6 days ago,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vnyn17p57o,"High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.
Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.
One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.
Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.
""This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,"" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.
Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.
Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.
""It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,"" Mr Bjerkestrand says.
""It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.""
Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.
Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.
The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.
It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.
""Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,"" said Mr Bjerkstand. ""There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.""
According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.
""It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!""
Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.
Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.
At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.
The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.
Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.
""It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,"" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.
His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. ""Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.""
At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.
""Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,"" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.
""We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.""
Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.
The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.
""We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.""
One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.
That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.
Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential ""digital Dark Age"", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.
That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.
Many firms offer long-term data storage.
Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.
For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.
Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.
That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.
The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.
Photographer, Christian Clauwers, who's been documenting South Pacific Islands threatened by sea level rise, was also adding his work.
""I deposited footage and photography, visual witnesses of the Marshall Islands,"" he says.
""The highest point of the island is three meters, and they're facing huge impact of climate change.""
""It was really humbling and surreal,"" says archivist Joanne Shortland, head of Heritage Collections at the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, after depositing records, engineers' drawings and photographs of historic car models.
""I have all these formats that are becoming obsolete.
""You need to keep changing the file format and making sure that it's accessible in 20 or 30, years time. The digital world has so many problems."""
Drought caused rebellion against Roman rule - study,"The University of Cambridge led the study about the rebellion, called the Barbarian Conspiracy.",21 Apr 2025,Cambridgeshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq7r99ng3o,"Three summers of extreme drought might have contributed to British rebellion against Roman legions, according to academic research.
The drought took place between 364 and 366 AD and may have been a determining factor behind the rebellion, called the Barbarian Conspiracy, which was an attack on Roman rule in Britain.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge analysed oak tree-ring records and surviving Roman accounts to argue that the droughts were a driving force in the pivotal events.
The findings have been published in the journal Climatic Change.
Picts, Scotti and Saxons inflicted crushing blows on weakened Roman defences in the spring and summer of AD367.
Senior Roman commanders were captured or killed and it took two years for generals to restore order.
Picts, people who inhabited northern Scotland in Roman times, attacked the province by land and sea.
The Scotti from modern-day Ireland invaded broadly in the west, and Saxons from the continent landed in the south.
The final remnants of official Roman administration left Britain some 40 years later.
Prof Ulf Büntgen said: ""Three consecutive droughts would have had a devastating impact on the productivity of Roman Britain's most important agricultural region.
""As Roman writers tell us, this resulted in food shortages with all of the destabilizing societal effects this brings.""
The droughts led to crop failure as they no longer had the wet climate they were used to in order to thrive. They happened during a poor period for Roman Britain where food and military resources were being stripped and placed elsewhere.
The researchers expanded their climate-conflict analysis to the entire Roman Empire for the period 350–476 CE.
They reconstructed the climate conditions immediately before and after 106 battles and found that a statistically significant number of battles were fought following dry years.

Helping to protect the future of chocolate,Scientists near Reading help protect the world's cocoa supply from pests and diseases.,26 Apr 2025,Berkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6de00j4yxo,"Tucked away in a corner of rural Berkshire, some non-descript greenhouses are playing a crucial role in satisfying our never-ending appetite for chocolate.
Work carried out at the International Cocoa Quarantine Centre in Arborfield, part of the University of Reading, is helping to keep the world's cocoa crops free of viruses.
The greenhouses - about the size of four double tennis courts - contain more than 300 mature cocoa plants from South America, West Africa and Asia.
Scientists put the plants through two years of quarantine before cuttings are sent worldwide to help create diversity in breeding cocoa plants.
Cocoa beans are the raw material for chocolate production, but prices have soared in recent years, caused by climate change and crop disease.
With 30% of global cocoa production lost through major pests and diseases, the centre's co-ordinator, Dr Andrew Daymond, said new varieties of cocoa needed to be ""more resilient"".
""We make sure that plant material is free of any pests and diseases - that's a process that takes two years,"" he said.
After quarantine, researchers send cuttings of disease-free plants to other research institutes around the world.
These can be incorporated into breeding programmes to create new varieties with ""built in"" resistance to pests and diseases, higher yields and greater tolerance to environmental stresses.
Dr Daymond said: ""It is a safe way of moving cocoa to create new types of cocoa in other countries.""
Most of the world's cocoa is grown in a belt near the Equator - so why is this work carried out in southern England?
Dr Daymond explained: ""It is better to do the intermediate quarantine in a colder country that doesn't produce cocoa as there are no risk of pests.
""Essentially, it is a safer place to have the facility.""
Also working at the centre is Professor of Archaeology at the University of Reading, Katie Sampeck.
She is exploring the full history of cocoa in chocolate which was produced as early as the13th Century.
Her research has examined how cocoa was harvested, processed and how the pods were split open to extract seeds for fermenting.
She said: ""We have been comparing the replica artefacts that we've been able to make to archaeological samples that come from the birthplace of chocolate in Central America.
""It is amazing, we think of it as a simple candy but it has a rich, complex history that we are learning much more about, just with these experiments.
""It is very surprising to be doing all of this here in Berkshire.""

A stunning reversal of fortunes in Canada's historic election,"After a campaign upended by Trump’s threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.",27 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78jv246n91o,"At a rally in London, Ontario, on Friday, the crowd booed as Mark Carney delivered his core campaign line about the existential threat Canada faces from its neighbour.
""President Trump is trying to break us so that America could own us,"" the Liberal leader warned.
""Never,"" supporters shouted back. Many waved Canadian flags taped to ice hockey sticks.
Similar levels of passion were also on display at the union hall where Pierre Poilievre greeted enthusiastic supporters in the Toronto area earlier in the week.
The Conservative leader has drawn large crowds to rallies across the country, where ""Bring it Home"" is a call to arms: both to vote for a change of government and a nod to the wave of Canadian patriotism in the face of US tariff threats.
In the final hours of a 36-day campaign, Donald Trump's shadow looms over everything. The winner of Monday's election is likely to be the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president.
National polls suggest the Liberals have maintained a narrow lead entering last stretch.
Still, Trump is not the only factor at play - he was only mentioned once in Poilievre's stump speech.
The Conservative leader has focused more on voters disaffected by what he calls a ""Lost Liberal decade"", promising change from a government he blames for the housing shortage and a sluggish economy, and for mishandling social issues like crime and the fentanyl crisis.
His pitch resonates with voters like Eric and Carri Gionet, from Barrie, Ontario. They have two daughters in their mid-20s and said they were attending their first ever political rally.
""We're pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,"" said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, ""there's no prospect"" their children will be able to do the same.
""I'm excited to be here,"" said Carri Gionet. ""I'm hopeful.""
Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.
Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.
Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.
By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.
It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.
Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.
For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is ""baffling"".
""Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,"" she said. ""It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.""
For Carney's supporters, they see a strong CV and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.
""I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,"" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.
Mr Brennan is a ""lifelong Liberal"" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.
The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released ""a massive pressure valve"", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.
""All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,"" she said.
Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's ""main character"", Ms Kurl said.
""The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.""
It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister never to have held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.
Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.
He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.
Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to ""Canada First"".
Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is ""Trump lite"", with his combative style, his vows to end ""woke ideology"", and willingness to take on the ""global elite"".
""I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,"" he has said.
More on the Canadian election:
Canadians have historically voted in either Conservative or Liberal governments, but smaller parties - like the NDP or the Bloc Québécois, a sovereigntist party that only runs candidates in the province of Quebec - have in the past formed Official Opposition.
In this campaign, both are languishing and face the possibility of losing a number of seats in the House of Commons as anxious voters turn towards the two main political parties.
If the Liberals and Conservatives both succeed in getting over 38% of the vote share nationally, as polls suggest is likely, it would be the first time that has happened since 1975.
The message from the NDP - which helped prop up the minority Liberals in the last government - in the final days of campaigning has been to vote strategically.
""You can make the difference between Mark Carney getting a super majority or sending enough New Democrats to Ottawa so we can fight to defend the things you care about,"" leader Jagmeet Singh said earlier this week.
The campaign has also highlighted festering divides along regional lines.
With much of the campaign dominated by the US-Canada relationship and the trade war, many issues - climate, immigration, indigenous reconciliation - have been on the backburner.
Even when the campaigns have focused on other policies, the discussion has centred on the country's economic future.
Both frontrunners agree in broad strokes on the priorities: the need to pivot away from dependence on the US; the development of oil, gas and mining sectors; protection for workers affected by tariffs; and increased defence spending.
But they disagree on who is best to lead Canada forward, especially when so much is at stake.
""It's time for experience, not experiments,"" Carney told his supporters in London.
Poilievre closing message was: ""We can choose change on Monday. We can take back control of our lives and build a bright future.""

Bid to reduce single-use plastic at railway station,Network Rail and City to Sea are encouraging use of refillable plastic bottles.,9 hrs ago,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkxkrnv712o,"Rail passengers are being encouraged to ditch single-use plastic as they travel.
Network Rail and Bristol-based environmental charity City to Sea have installed free water refill stations and signs and digital screens encouraging rail passengers to use bottles throughout Bristol Temple Meads station.
City to Sea estimates around five million single-use plastic bottles are discarded across the county every day.
""By placing refilling at the heart of one of the UK's busiest travel hubs, we empowered hundreds of thousands of people to refill rather than reaching for a plastic bottle,"" said partnership manager Cyan Stuart.
""This partnership with Network Rail shows just how powerful collaboration can be in driving behaviour change,"" she added.
The charity also provides an app which highlights where free water refills can be obtained.
City to Sea estimates the refill station has already stopped more than 69,000 plastic bottles from being discarded.
Bristol Temple Meads' station manager at Network Rail, Gabriella Colwell, said: ""We all have a part to play in tackling plastic pollution and we're proud to be working with City to Sea to make a difference at Bristol Temple Meads.
""By highlighting how simple and quick it is to fill up at the station, we're reducing the need for passengers to turn to single-use plastics.""

Anger flares at Just Stop Oil 'last day of action',A van appears to have been driven slowly towards protesters as hundreds marched through London.,26 Apr 2025,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7xpxp6xxmo,"A van appears to have been driven slowly into Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters as hundreds marched through London for their ""last day of action"".
A mass of people wearing JSO's orange vests rallied in Westminster on Saturday after the group claimed a victory on new oil and gas licences and said ""we're hanging up the hi vis"".
The group has drawn attention, criticism and jail terms for protests ranging from throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers and spray-painting Charles Darwin's grave, to climbing on M25 gantries.
During the march, a man in a white minivan appeared to edge it forwards until it was pressed against protesters. Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away.
The minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger.
People standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police ""officer, I'm being pushed back"".
The driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked.
Police reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest.
Other similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera.
In its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: ""Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history.
""We've kept over 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful.""
The Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution.
Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.
The Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment.

Why the mighty Himalayas are getting harder and harder to see,"Severe air pollution is obscuring visibility of the highest mountain peaks on Earth, hitting tourism hard.",2 days ago,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdl092jj5o,"I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.
Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.
The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.
And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.
Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.
The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day – but there was no such day during my two-week stay.
Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.
""I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,"" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.
""Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.""
During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region – but had hardly any luck there either.
Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.
Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.
June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.
Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.
But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.
Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.
""In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,"" she added
An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a ""major let-down"".
""It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,"" said John Carrol.
Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.
""Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,"" he told the BBC.
On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.
""We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,"" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.
However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.
The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.
But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.
""The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,"" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.
South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.
Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.
Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.
This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.
Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.
""Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,"" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.
In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.
Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.
This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.
""We are left to do business with guilt when we are unable to show our clients the mountains that they pay us for,"" said trekking leader Ms Chhetri.
""And there is nothing we can do about the haze.""

'We have more in common with America than the rest of Canada',"In Alberta, many voters feel alienated by the country’s elite - some are even tempted by Trump’s call to join the US.",26 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg8r85n1eo,"The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation.
Standing in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta's future.
Who thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands.
Who thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands.
""How many people would like Alberta to join the US?"" Another show of support from half the crowd.
Mr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.
The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.
Mr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.
""We're not interested in that"", he said. ""We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.""
Jeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.
""We have a lot more culturally in common with our neighbours to the south in Montana… [and] with our cousins in Texas, than we do anywhere else,"" he said.
Previously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open.
In an opinion piece for national newspaper the Globe and Mail, Preston Manning - an Albertan considered one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in Canada - warned ""large numbers of Westerners simply will not stand for another four years of Liberal government, no matter who leads it"".
Accusing the party of mismanaging national affairs and ignoring the priorities of western Canadians, he added: ""A vote for the Carney Liberals is a vote for Western secession – a vote for the breakup of Canada as we know it.""
This sense of ""western alienation"", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.
That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.
National polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.
Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote ""yes"" in an independence referendum.
She said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.
""He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?"" Ms Schneider said.
An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.
Political analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would ""not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,"" Mr Modry, the activist, said.
That wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.
In Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a ""national unity crisis"" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.
While Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as ""nonsense"", critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada's future.
Even those within the separatist movement have different ideas on how best to achieve their goals.
Lorna Guitton, a born-and-bred Albertan and a volunteer with the Alberta Prosperity Project, told the BBC in Lethbridge that her aim was for the province to have a better relationship with the rest of Canada.
She described the current union as ""broken"", and believes a referendum, or the threat of it, will give Albertans ""leverage"" in future negotiations with Ottawa.
But Ms Guitton also dismissed any notion of it becoming a 51st US state.
""They've got enough of their own problems. Why would I want to be part of that?"" she said. ""I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada.""
At his ranch outside of Calgary in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Mr Rath has a different view.
As he tended to his race horses, he spoke of the political and social attitudes of free enterprise and small government that are shared by Albertans and many Americans.
""From that perspective, I would see Alberta as being a good fit within the United States,"" he said.
He is currently putting together a ""fact-finding"" delegation to travel to Washington DC and bring the movement directly to the Trump administration.
Many voters in Alberta, however, dismiss the notion of independence altogether, even if they agree that the province has been overlooked.
Steve Lachlan from Lethbridge agrees the West lacks representation in Ottawa but said: ""We already have separation, and we need to come together.""
And the Liberals are not entirely shut out from the province. Polls suggest that Alberta may send more Liberal MPs to Ottawa than in 2021, partly due to changing demographics that led to the creation of new ridings in urban Edmonton and Calgary.
James Forrester, who lives in the battleground Calgary Centre district, told the BBC he had traditionally voted Conservative but has leaned left in recent years. This time, he will vote Liberal because of the ""Carney factor"".
""I feel he's the best guy to deal with Trump,"" he said. As for the separation sentiment: ""I'm not worried about it.""

"Volunteers help plant 50,000 trees in five years",Swindon's council and Wiltshire Wildlife Trust plan to plant thousands more with help of volunteers.,29 Apr 2025,Wiltshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7gl3x033o,"More than 50,000 trees have been planted across a town during the past five years, exceeding expectations and providing rewarding work for volunteers.
Wiltshire Wildlife Trust wanted to plant trees across 494 acres (200 hectares) - but 568 acres (230 hectares) have been covered, with more trees still to come.
High demand has led to trees being planted in some unused allotments which are prone to flooding.
The wildlife trust and Swindon Borough Council worked together on the Great Western Community Forest and Swindon Forest Meadows projects, launching Trees for Climate five years ago.
Karl Scaplehorn, who began volunteering with Swindon Forest Meadows, said: ""I joined the wellbeing group five years ago.
""It's very rewarding, I've learned new skills, gained new confidence and the people are great. It's good to be out in nature. I'd recommend it.""
The rewards for volunteer James Pitter include a boost to his career. He graduated with a degree in wildlife biology last year and has now secured a job working on bat ecology.
""Employers wanted practical experience and skills,"" he said.
""I've learned new skills and got more experience. I've been involved in tree planting, I've managed people, worked on infrastructure like paths and fences and cleared habitats.""
Peter Field started volunteering with the project in 2020 after he retired, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
He said: ""I was a history teacher, so I've learned a lot more about nature than I knew, and being outdoors is good my health, both my body and head.
""There are a lot of interesting projects, and it gives me a sense of purpose and wellbeing to come and volunteer here.""
Neil Pullen, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust's conservation officer, said the tree canopy in the borough has increased from 8% to 13%.
The trust has also been collecting seeds from native trees in Swindon.
""There are great 'cultural' trees in Swindon which we'd like to take seeds from,"" he added.
""The mulberry at the Richard Jefferies Museum, for example, or the great willow in Wroughton. If we could use the seeds from those trees here, we'd be preserving the cultural legacy as well as the genetic one.""
Other smaller projects have been going on, such as counting Great Crested Newts and clearing flood meadows.
""We have an amazing history and culture of trees and nature here in Swindon and we should shout about it and celebrate it,"" said Mr Pullen.

Reform take Durham as Farage warns council workers,"Reform UK secures 65 seats, as Nigel Farage warns civil servants ""working from home"".",2 May 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg419g63qelo,"Reform UK has taken control of Durham County Council after winning more than half of the seats.
It secured 65 councillors, gaining heavily from Labour, the Conservatives and independents, with all 98 results declared.
Party leader Nigel Farage MP, who visited the area during the election campaign, spoke at a celebration event in Newton Aycliffe.
He warned those at the council working on climate change or diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, or anyone who ""thinks they can go on working from home, I think you better all be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly"".
He criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for not taking Reform seriously when he joked the party would ""have the Conservatives for breakfast"".
""But he missed a bit. We were going to have the Labour Party for lunch and that's what we have done,"" Farage said.
Among the newly elected councillors is former GB News presenter Darren Grimes, who is from County Durham, and who won one of two seats for Reform representing the Annfield Plain and Tanfield ward.
""I gave up a job in telly land to stand here and do this,"" he said.
""I'm obviously personally delighted but I'm also really humbled by the number of people who put their trust and faith in us to deliver for them.""
He said if Reform took control of the council, they would ""get the auditors in"" to make sure no money was being wasted.
The council was previously run as a coalition between the Liberal Democrats, Tories and independent councillors.
Liberal Democrat leader Amanda Hopgood - who previously led the council - has retained her seat, with her party securing 14 councillors, increasing its number by one. The Green Party also picked up an extra seat, taking its number of councillors to two.
Labour has been left with just four seats on the council, with local leader Carl Marshall one of the political casualties, losing his seat in Stanley to Reform.
Marshall said the council was in ""decent financial nick"" but Reform would have to have some ""very challenging discussions because of the cost pressures"" County Durham faced.
The Conservatives have just one councillor from the previous 16, with local party leader Richard Bell holding on to his Upper Teesdale seat. There are 14 independent councillors.
Labour MP for Blaydon and Consett Liz Twist, who attended the Durham County Council count, said the local election results showed her party needed to ""move faster"" when enacting its policy changes.
""We have a clear plan and we need to make sure people understand that plan,"" she said.
Reform also won its first seat on Hartlepool Borough Council following a by-election.
Amanda Napper took the Throston ward seat from Labour with 889 votes.
Speaking after the count, she told the Local Democracy Reporting Service her priorities would be to tackle anti-social behaviour.
""When you see the state of Throston ward it makes you realise how much hard work it needs to pull it into shape, so I'm fully eyes wide open to the amount of work needed,"" she said.
Elsewhere in the North East, Labour managed to hold off Reform in a tightly run  race for North Tyneside mayor.
Karen Clark was elected to the post, replacing Dame Norma Redfearn who stepped down from the role, which effectively leads the council.
In Northumberland, the Conservatives held on to 26 county council seats to remain the largest party there, but fell short of the 35 needed for a majority.
Reform surged into second place, with 23 new councillors elected.

Tuvalu unveils first cash machines in 'momentous' ceremony,Tiny cash-based Pacific nation gets electronic banking for the first time.,16 Apr 2025,World,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3vyvdz1pko,"The tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu has unveiled its first ever cash machines in a move hailed as momentous by the prime minister.
Their instalment marks the first time the island's 11,000 inhabitants have had access to electronic banking.
Five machines and 30 sale terminals have been installed on Funafuti, the country's main island, including at its airport.
Feleti Teo, the prime minister, said the move ""not only marks a momentous occasion but it is also historic as the bank moves into a totally new era"".
""We've been in an analogue space all along, these were dreams for us,"" Teo said according to the Guardian.
""These machines don't come cheap. But with government support and sheer determination, we were able to roll out this service for our people.""
The ceremony took place at the headquarters of the National Bank of Tuvalu in the village of Vaiaku on Funafuti. It was also attended by traditional leaders, members of parliament and business officials.
Until now, Tuvaluans have had to physically visit a bank to get money, and lengthy queues form outside as workers withdraw salaries on pay day.
Shops will also be able to process electronic payments for the first time.
The cash machines will initially only accept prepaid cards, however. The bank plans to introduce debit and credit cards that can be used internationally at a later date.
The head of the national bank, Siose Penitala Teo, said the move to electronic banking and payments would open the door to economic empowerment.
Tuvalu is a group of nine small islands in the South Pacific which won independence from the United Kingdom in 1978.
Formerly known as the Ellice Islands, all are low-lying, with no point on Tuvalu being higher than 4.5m above sea level.
Local politicians have campaigned against climate change, arguing that it could see the islands swamped by rising sea levels.
In November, Teo delivered a national statement at the COP29 Climate Conference in Azerbaijan, warning that rising sea levels as a result of melting glaciers will one day mean Tuvalu is entirely submerged."
Scientists study green roof at uni's 'living lab',The Open University is the latest building in Milton Keynes to get a green roof.,29 Apr 2025,"Beds, Herts & Bucks",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25xq6wxldo,"A university has added a green roof on its campus so scientists can study the impact of growing plants on top of buildings.
The Open University (OU) said its ""living roof lab"" in Milton Keynes would ""contribute to crucial research on the ecological and urban benefits"" of green roofing systems.
Milton Keynes has more intensive green roofs than any other UK city outside London or Edinburgh, according to Chris Bridgman, whose company is working with the OU.
""This research is really important to help us lobby government, to make sure green roofs are used to help tackle climate change,"" he said.
The two-year project will collect data from the ""experimental site"" on top of the OU's Stuart Hall building.
Dr Kadmiel Maseyk, leading the research, said the team would test eight different combinations of substrates and vegetation, from crushed brick and limestone to sedum and wildflowers.
Dr Maseyk said although ""we do know quite a lot about the benefits"" of green roofs, the phenomenon had not been widely tested in the UK.
""The majority of this research comes from Europe and North America, but it's important to understand how this translates into the UK.
""We are looking at our specific requirements, both in the way the UK climate is now - and might change in future - and the kind of native vegetation we could use,"" he said.
Green roofs can suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, provide habitats for pollinators, and help to insulate buildings.
""Cooling very important due to the urban heat island effect, as cities heat up more quickly,"" he added.
Sarah Smyth, who manages the YMCA café, said their green roof ""fills me with so much joy"".
""We get the opportunity to have salads and vegetables that are grown up here and use them in our kitchen. It's organic: no spray, and no air miles, what could be better?
""It's magical, being able to come up here, seeing what's ready to pick.
""I do think we should do more of this. Every single roof in Milton Keynes should be covered in green roofs.
""Think about how much CO2 you'd be absorbing, how different our city would from anybody else's,"" she said.
Mr Bridgman said green roofs could also help to reduce flash flooding and ""prolong the roof life by up to three times, by protecting the waterproof layer from sun and rain"".
""Our council are really behind this, ensuring it is included in developments, and we've seen a huge increase in the number of green roofs that are included in planning permission.""
Dr Maseyk hopes the research will encourage the government to back the idea on a national scale.
""We hope to inform policy-making, so green roofs are captured more in planning decisions and become a much more integral component of buildings in the future,"" he said.

Australian politician fined for supplying cocaine,David Speirs initially dismissed evidence against him as a 'deepfake' but admitted later that he lied.,24 Apr 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr783dd08k3o,"An Australian politician has been convicted of supplying drugs after he initially dismissed a video showing him snorting a white substance as a ""deepfake"".
Former South Australian Liberal party leader David Speirs was fined A$9,000 (£4311; $5,720) and ordered to complete 37.5 hours of community service by an Adelaide court on Thursday.
Speirs was arrested in September after footage of him snorting off a plate was published by News Corp. He initially denied wrongdoing and reportedly told the news outlet it was a ""deepfake"" and that he had never used cocaine.
However, he later admitted that was a lie and the ensuing scandal and charges led to his resignation from parliament.
Last month, Speirs pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine to two men in August.
Speirs' defence said he used drugs ""as a form of escapism"" from the stress of his work, but the offences did not occur in a work capacity.
The case had sparked intense media scrutiny, with prosecutors arguing that it was in the public's interest given Speirs' senior position in politics.
His lawyer had previously asked the court not to record the conviction so his client could travel overseas, but the magistrate said the offences were ""too serious"".
""The need for public denunciation for this type of offending and the need for general deterrence is too great to refrain from recording a conviction,"" magistrate Brian Nitschke said on Thursday.
Nitschke acknowledged Speirs' defence that the offences occurred during a time of stress but added it was ""certainly no excuse"".
Speirs stepped into the role of South Australia's Liberal leader in 2022 and had served 10 years as a member of parliament.
He did not speak to media after his sentencing."
Club's £1m pitch is 'gift to the community',Spalding United has announced a £1m investment in the Sir Halley Stewart Playing Field.,1 May 2025,Lincolnshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creqr7d90l5o,"A non-league football club in Lincolnshire has announced a £1m investment in its ground.
Spalding United will be laying what it calls a ""state-of-the-art"" artificial pitch at the Sir Halley Stewart Playing Field.
The floodlights and the changing rooms will also be improved.
The club, known as the Tulips, described the investment as a gift to supporters and the wider community.
Spalding United, which competes in the Southern League Premier Central, has a 25-year lease on the playing field.
Club owner Andrew Killingsworth said: ""This is a pivotal moment. We're not only elevating our facilities to support our promotion ambitions but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable future.""
Chief executive Leigh Porter added: ""This is a big first step for us. It's massive in the current climate.""
Mr Porter said the new artificial pitch was the same type used by Chelsea at their training ground, with officials from Spalding travelling there to see it for themselves.
Spalding United said the investment would help expand its footballing operations, introducing new teams across all age groups and strengthening its women's and junior sections.
Work began this week and should be completed by early August.

Why arsenic levels in rice are rising,"Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.",18 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250417-how-climate-change-could-affect-arsenic-in-rice,"Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.
Rice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.
So it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.
The presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.
Yet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Researchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice – and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).
But a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.
They found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.
""Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health – it's a long laundry list,"" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. ""And two metrics of climate change – the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures – are resulting in greater amounts.""
It's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions ""business as usual"" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.
While the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.
""We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature – but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,"" says Ziska.
More like this:
• The foods that eat up carbon
• Saving Italy's polluted sea
• Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants
Of course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice – so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.
Still, this is ""one of the most comprehensive studies"" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. ""This is as robust as you’re ever likely to get.""
Humans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.
Over the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.
This is particularly true of inorganic arsenic – the term used for arsenic that doesn't have carbon atoms attached to it – which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why ""natural"" doesn’t always mean better).
This means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.
And, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.
Lowering the arsenic in your rice
If you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.
First, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.
Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.
The UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.
The problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska – in irrigated paddy fields.
Rice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. ""That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,"" Ziska says. ""But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil."" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.
""When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,"" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.
And this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. ""This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,"" Ziska says. ""It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.""
Ziska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.
What worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's ""cancer potency factor"", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that ""arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed"", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.
Aside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight – which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease – or have developmental neurocognitive effects.
For individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day – or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person – would raise the relative risk of developing bladder cancer or diabetes by about 3%.
But across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.
Inorganic arsenic
If everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that – compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic – an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.
The amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.
So, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?
""We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,"" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. ""But we need to do something differently.""
Researchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process – where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again – does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. ""But that just increases cadmium,"" Meharg says. ""And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat."" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.
There is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.
Because some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser – one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.
Another approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.
There also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. ""Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,"" says Meharg.
Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.
""There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,"" Ziska says. ""It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.""
* This article was updated on 25 April 2025 to clarify that the EPA review found the consumption of arsenic in rice would raise the relative risk of developing bladder cancer or diabetes by 3%. The earlier version stated the risk for diabetes was 1%.

Council considers ban on garden bonfires,A west London council considers creating a bylaw to ban people from having garden bonfires.,3 days ago,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmkwjvz9r9o,"A west London council is considering creating a by-law to ban people from having bonfires in their gardens, with the aim of reducing pollution.
The proposal by Hammersmith and Fulham Council would prevent burning household or garden waste outside, but would not apply to barbecues, domestic fire-pits and indoor wood burning, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
According to Public Health England, deaths from particulate air pollution in Hammersmith and Fulham in 2023 were one per cent above the England average.
A new by-law can take up to six months to establish, requires a public consultation and the outline of the by-law must also be approved by the Secretary of State.
Particulate pollution (PM) refers to the mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air that can be either naturally occurring or human-made.
The council must carry out studies of the borough's domestic wood burning emissions and an analysis on the impacts of outdoor fires on public health.
Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, councils must investigate smoke complaints if it is considered a ""statutory nuisance"" which can lead to an abatement notice requiring it to stop or be reduced.
However, Hammersmith and Fulham Council says this law is ""reactive"" - it only applies if someone complains and doesn't ban burning outright, hence their proposed by-law.
""Outdoor fires and wood burning create harmful particulate matter emissions, for which it is considered there is no safe level,"" a report by the council said.
""Short term exposure to high particulate matter emissions can cause asthma episodes and play a part in a multitude of other longer-term effects.""
The by-law would have ""climate adaptation and resilience benefits"" reducing the risk of fires becoming ""out of control"" in warmer and drier weather, the report added.

Israel fires largely controlled after mass evacuations,A national emergency was declared and events for Israel's Independence Day on Thursday were cancelled as the fires spread near Jerusalem.,2 May 2025,Middle East,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2vlewj09o,"Fires that have ravaged large parts of central Israel since Wednesday have largely been extinguished, the country's Fire and Rescue Authority says.
More than 150 teams have been battling the blaze, which has scorched around 20 sq km (7.7 sq miles) of land in the Latrun area - between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Israel's ambulance service said at least 12 people had been treated for smoke inhalation, but no fatalities have been reported. Seventeen firefighters were injured, according to Israeli broadcaster Kan.
Authorities said hot and dry conditions, with strong winds, made controlling the fires more challenging, and a senior official warned they could flare up again.
""I've been in the service for 24 years, and I've been through many fires,"" said Shlomi Harush, a deputy commander of Ayalon fire station. ""There's no doubt that this is one of the toughest fires I've seen.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had declared a national emergency in response to the fires, and hundreds of people evacuated their homes, but an evacuation order for 12 towns near Jerusalem has now been lifted.
Countries including France, Italy and Spain had dispatched aircraft to assist in the emergency.
The fires led to the cancellation of most official events celebrating Israel's Independence Day on Thursday, and there was a nationwide ban on lighting fires for barbecues - a traditional part of the day.
A major highway linking Jerusalem and Tel Aviv has now reopened. Videos posted online earlier this week showed people abandoning their cars as flames and smoke whipped across the road.
Israeli authorities have provided conflicting accounts for the cause of the fire.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the fires were ""part of the climate crisis, which must not be ignored"".
Netanyahu blamed the fires on arsonists and said that 18 people had been arrested, but Israeli police later said that only three suspects were in detention, and they were not linked to the wildfires."
"Fire came at worst time for wildlife, says charity","The large wildfire destroyed about 1,230 acres (50 sq km) of land on Dartmoor.",8 days ago,Devon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dgdm2pvego,"A large wildfire that destroyed about 1,230 acres (50 sq km) of land on Dartmoor happened at ""the very worst time for wildlife"", a charity has said.
Farmers, Dartmoor National Park rangers and firefighters all helped tackle the blaze at the Dartmoor Forest area near Cut Hill.
The fire started on Sunday and was extinguished at about 17:00 BST on Monday. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the blaze was still unknown.
Steve Hussey, from Devon Wildlife Trust, said the long dry spell had ""made wildfires a real risk to some of our most loved countryside"".
He said: This large fire on Dartmoor comes at the very worst time for wildlife.
""Spring sees birds nesting, small mammals giving birth to their young, and reptiles emerging from their hibernation.
""Animals including skylarks, field mice and adders will be among the many that are affected by its destruction.
""Wild places can and do bounce back in time from wildfires, but the increasing instance and ferocity of the fires we're seeing as our climate changes is putting an extra burden on nature.""
A spokesperson for the fire service said they urged people to avoid lighting outdoor fires and to fully extinguish cigarettes.
Although the wildlife trust does not manage the land which was affected, it also urged people not to light open fires in the countryside.

'Carney's not the messiah!' How 10 Canadians decided who to back,The BBC spoke to 10 voters across the country about the issues and politicians who influenced their vote.,28 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r54kej8jwo,"Election day is finally upon us as a short but packed campaign reaches its climax.
Later on Monday, Canadians will discover who will lead their country into what seems like a difficult and uncertain future as the country faces a trade war with its biggest economic partner, the US.
The BBC has spoken to 10 voters about who they are voting for and what their chief concerns are. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.
Here is what they had to say.
Gwendolyn, 69, is voting Conservative and said the last Liberal government destroyed Canada.
The reason I'm voting for the Conservative Party is because during the last 10 years, the Liberal government has really brought Canada to its knees. It's really made Canada a cautionary tale about what not to be.
Mark Carney is not a Messiah. He seems to be a very nice man, but not much more. I don't trust him, I see him as another Justin Trudeau, possibly even worse.
My top concern is not this so-called crisis with the US; I want Canadians to have some hope for the future, while right now there's a sense of despair.
I know many people saw Pierre Poilievre as an attack dog when he was the opposition leader, but since he's been campaigning to be PM, I've seen a different side of him. He seems to really be able to connect with ordinary people.
It's absolutely baffling [that the Conservatives lost a 20 point lead]. I think people are going to be very, very disappointed. The Liberals are the same party; Carney is just one person. And he's not going to change anything.
The 66-year-old engineer is a Conservative Party member, but voted Liberal this election.
Rather than vote for a party, I voted for the leader of the party. I voted Liberal, and that has much to do with Carney and the experience that he has.
When I'm hiring someone for work, I ask for a CV. You see the things [Carney] has done at the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, and his competence and contacts impress me.
Poilievre is a career politician, and we've had nine years of a career politician.
I'm a Conservative Party member, I would normally have voted Conservative, but I don't think Poilievre has the required experience [to be prime minister].
It's probably the first time in my life I'm voting for a leader as opposed to a party.
Adam, 52, is a British-Canadian doctor working at a hospital on a remote Indigenous reserve.
The NDP is offering more to Indigenous people, and that's a big reason why I'll be voting NDP.
Indigenous voices and needs are getting lost in this election. So I'm most concerned about what Canada's next government is going to do about, for example, the scandal that there are reserves in one of the richest countries in the world where people still don't have clean running water. I judge a country by how it treats its neediest.
I think we can't forget about that just because of what is happening with US and Canada at the moment.
Stacey, 56, is so frustrated with the Liberal government that she is voting Conservative for the first time in her life.
I have been a lifelong federal Liberal Party voter and Liberal Party member. This year I voted Conservative, and I also got my Conservative membership.
The last 14 years of the Liberals hasn't done anything. There's been a lot of things that they did that have disaffected people.
I used to be in the military, and it drives me insane as a vet to see how this government has gutted the Canadian armed forces. If the US was going to try to take Canada, we wouldn't have a hope. If Russia decided to attack our north, we wouldn't have a hope.
I know that Trump is a big problem. But Mark Carney, all he's so far campaigned on is 'I'm the best man to deal with Trump'. All the big issues that were there before - housing, affordability, etc - those are still there. He's just Trudeau-lite. He's more of the same.
Alex, a 25-year-old recent graduate, said this election is about leadership.
I'm voting for my local Liberal candidate, and I want Mark Carney as our PM because I think he's the man for the job right now.
My election issue is leadership. It's about who's going to lead us, especially against the US.
Carney is not really a politician, which I like. He doesn't speak in soundbites. I also appreciate that he's way less showy - [former prime minister] Trudeau was a celebrity, but he's more down to earth.
I have a very unfavourable opinion of Mr Poilievre.
Most Canadians don't like Donald Trump, but there's a section of the Conservative base that does like him. And I do see a link between Trump and Poilievre. They're not the same, but [Poilievre] is definitely fishing in the same right-wing waters.
Cole, 21, will cast his first ever vote in a federal election for the Conservatives.
I've just been very disappointed by the Liberal leadership for the past decade - it's been half of my life - and I want to see a change.
It is the primary job of whoever becomes prime minister to focus absolutely on domestic policy and to make Canada stronger.
So I don't think renegotiating trade deals with the United States is going to be as important as dealing with internal issues.
And particularly in western Canada, [the Conservative] platform is focused on us a lot more than the Liberals' [platform] is.
Michael, a 60-year-old trucker who travels between the US and Canada, said he doesn't want to see populist politics in his home country.
I voted Liberal this time. Traditionally, I've been more centre/centre-left as a voter and in the past I've either voted for the Green Party or NDP.
I've respected Carney for years since he was the governor of the Bank of Canada and how he dealt with the 2008 crisis. Whether we like it or not, we're going to be hurting economically for the next five or 10 years. So we need someone who is an expert.
I've seen populist movements in countries like the US, Hungary, and Turkey, and that worries me. Finding groups of people - migrants, immigrants, whatever - to blame for society's problems instead of trying to figure out a solution worries me quite a bit.
I know Pierre Poilievre is not a Trump person, but my belief is that he saw how Trump built power in the US, and uses the same sorts of tactics to build his power here. That was a big turnoff.
The 20-year-old geography student said he voted for the New Democratic Party because they are the most different from the leadership in the United States.
I believe the NDP cares the most about people. They have a clear plan for housing and for public transit, and as artificial intelligence takes over jobs, they have a plan to increase welfare. I think they care the most about equally distributing the wealth among people, and are not ultra capitalistic.
My main concerns are housing, affordability and especially the environment. Recently, the Liberals and Conservatives have abandoned speaking about the environment. I thought the carbon tax was a good measure. I think it was misunderstood, and the NDP still supports [it].
Myron, 45, said he wants to see a united Canada at the end of this election.
I voted early because there's really only one clear choice right now. I voted for the Liberals. If the previous PM had stayed in power, then I would have had a very difficult decision to make.
Our country works better together, and I think somebody who knows how to use financial levers is a very good candidate.
I grew up in rural Manitoba, which is a very blue [conservative] area, and that's how I was raised.
Over the years, I've had life experiences that have shown me that the world isn't black and white, and that it's not simple to solve all its problems.
The 52-year-old said she supports the Liberals because Mark Carney has the most experience to deal with the US.
I plan to vote for the Liberals for Mark Carney. I believe that he has the best experience for the job in the face of the threat from the United States.
I have voted for all three parties in the past - Liberals, Conservatives and NDP. But this time, the Conservatives have gone way too far for me in their populist message.
I was most concerned with our relationship with the United States and climate change.
I think the Conservatives have backed away from climate change - they keep talking about 'axing the tax' and don't want to pay carbon tax. But climate change is real; it's a real thing and it's happening.
When Mark Carney said it would be a privilege  to work for Canada, and that he was leaving the US and coming home to deal with this crisis - that really caught my attention.

Spain rules out cyber attack - but what could have caused power cut?,The Spanish grid operator said the preliminary assessment suggests there was no cyber attack.,29 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209yrl3258o,"The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday.
Red Eléctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest ""there was no kind of interference in the control systems"" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro the day before.
But the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear.
The grid operator said on Tuesday they ""cannot draw conclusions"" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures ""to ensure that this does not happen again.""
Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.
Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.
Follow live: Travel chaos continues
Sánchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was ""suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds"".
Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two ""disconnection events"" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.
One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.
However, Sánchez later said the power cut was ""not a problem of excessive renewables"". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.
So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.
The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.
If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.
""When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,"" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.
If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have ""cascading effects"" and lead to a black-out, she added.
But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.
Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy ""because of its intermittency"", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.
""It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,"" she said.
Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that ""if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,"" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.
""Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,"" he said.
""All sorts of systems fail,"" he added. ""Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.""
Red Eléctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.
Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.
Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.
The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an ""electricity island"" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.
Sánchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.
Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.
The message in Portuguese said that ""due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'"".
""These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.""
However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator ""did not put out this statement,"" without giving further details."
New £50m bypass opens after delays,West Sussex County Council says delays were caused by 'the worst rains in 200 years'.,5 days ago,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xgljwy40yo,"A new £50m bypass designed to divert traffic away from a number of villages in West Sussex will open on Friday.
Vehicles can begin using the A284 Lyminster Bypass (North) from 14:00 BST.
It was initially set to open in autumn last year but West Sussex County Councillor Joy Dennis said building work was delayed due to ""the worst rainfall in 200 years"".
Ms Dennis, councillor for highways and transport, said: ""We're anticipating far less congestion and a much easier flow of traffic for residents and businesses to move from the A27 down to Littlehampton while avoiding the villages of Lyminster and Wick.""
Ms Dennis also said the bypass would help to reduce waiting times caused by a level crossing in the area.
Built on a flood plain, the new road has a 225m (738ft) viaduct spanning Black Ditch, an ancient waterway, to allow for potential changes to water levels due to future climate change, the council added.
Steve Horton, regional director of Jackson Civil Engineering, said: ""One of the issues we've had to overcome with this job is the existing ground conditions, because we're working on very soft, deep soil which are former river beds.""
There is also a ""very unique"" Pegasus crossing on the bypass, allowing pedestrians, cyclists, horses and farm vehicles to cross the road.
""We're cutting through an existing bridleway, so we're accommodating the equestrian crossing and were aware it was also used by cyclists and pedestrians,"" said Mr Horton.
The opening of the road is the end of a ten year project, with initial planning beginning in 2015.

What Pope's speedy election says about Church's priorities,"The new Pope is seen as someone who could unite traditionalist and progressive within the Church, writes the BBC's religion editor.",5 days ago,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2epnpr3ko,"The fact that the conclave was over quickly suggests that from the outset, a significant number of the voting cardinals felt Robert Prevost was the one amongst them best equipped to take on the challenges a pope faces.
In the lead up to the election - during the formal meetings of cardinals, and the informal dinners and coffees they had to discuss the type of person they were looking for - it was apparent that two words kept coming up, ""continuity"" and ""unity"".
There was a recognition among many that Pope Francis had started something hugely impactful, through reaching out to those living on the margins of society, to those on the peripheries of the Catholic world and also to those outside the faith.
There was appreciation for his endeavour to become a voice for the voiceless and focus on the poor and those whose destinies were not in their own hands.
But there was also a sense that work had to be done to resolve the (sometimes very public) splits between those of different schools of thought within the Church hierarchy, often characterised as traditionalist and progressive.
It was in that context that Robert Prevost's name started to be talked of as a serious contender. As someone who supported Pope Francis behind the scenes, but who different factions could still think of as one of their own.
But the voting cardinals had been tasked by the Church with considering not just what the institution and Catholic believers needed, but also what humanity needed at a difficult juncture, with war and division the backdrop.
Again, Cardinal Prevost - the US-Peruvian dual national, who was talked of as feeling as at home with his North American peers as he was with Latin American colleagues - was seen as someone who, as pope, could connect different worlds.
Pope Francis was sometimes criticised for lacking an ability to win more allies in the US on the big issues of migration, climate change and inequality, because of a disconnect in understanding the most effective ways of communicating his arguments to them.
For those who had in their minds that the primary requirement being sought of a new pope was an ability to bring ""continuity"" and ""unity"", during his speech on St Peter's balcony, Leo XIV gave strong clues as to why the cardinals chose him.
In his talk of ""building bridges"" and people globally being ""one people"" he evoked echoes of Pope Francis and also talked of unity at its fullest.
In these early days, his past will be heavily scrutinised.  His political views examined, his track record on dealing with abuse dissected, and his comments over the years on social issues charted.
Much of this is already in the public domain so it can only be assumed that the cardinal electors felt there was nothing of enough consequence to impair his ability to lead the Catholic Church and be the global moral voice they were looking for.
Huge challenges lie ahead. But with resolution after just four conclave votes, he starts out with a strong mandate from the men he will need the most through his papacy."
Highest ever number of volunteers for overseas aid,"The volunteers helped with projects in Nepal, Malawi and Rwanda, a report says.",28 Apr 2025,Jersey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce84pl53v9go,"A record number of people from Jersey applied as volunteers last year in the three countries where it sends aid.
Jersey Overseas Aid teams supported education, housing and environment projects in Nepal, Malawi and Rwanda.
A new report has revealed 126 people applied to volunteer there last year - up from 107 the year before.
The report said volunteering ""showcased the generosity and dedication of islanders to international development"".
Teachers from the island supported schools in Rwanda with English coaching and mentoring.
In Nepal, volunteers worked with charities on climate projects, and in Malawi people helped to build houses.
The organisation has sent volunteers from Jersey to aid projects since 1972.
Deputy Carolyn Labey, Minister for International Development & Chair of Jersey Overseas Aid Commission, said in the report last year was ""a standout year for our humanitarian funding"".

Peter Dutton: The ex-cop who took Australia's opposition to the brink,"One of the country's most experienced but polarising politicians, he failed to win the premiership.",3 May 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45254762,"In 2002, a fresh-faced former policeman stood up in Canberra's Parliament House and introduced himself to the nation.
Peter Dutton warmly thanked the community which had elected him, before launching into a strongly worded speech against crime, trade unions, and refugee advocacy groups.
""As a police officer,"" he said, ""I have seen the best and the worst that society has to offer. I have seen the wonderful, kind nature of people willing to offer any assistance to those in their worst hour, and I have seen the sickening behaviour displayed by people who, frankly, barely justify their existence in our sometimes over-tolerant society.""
Dutton vowed to fight for the ""forgotten people"" of Australia who were ""fed up"" with the ""boisterous minority and the politically correct"" - a stance he has steadfastly clung to during his climb to the top of the Liberal-National Coalition.
Sometimes likened to Donald Trump in both policy and rhetoric - a comparison he rejects - the 54-year-old's hard-line brand of conservativism and combative statements made him one of Australian politics' most polarising figures.
But he was also one of its most experienced, with 20 years as an MP under his belt, many of them spent as a senior minister handling key portfolios like health, immigration, defence and home affairs.
He took over leadership of the Coalition after its worst defeat in 70 years, but in only one term made it competitive again, a feat even some on his side of the aisle had thought impossible.
With a 2025 campaign focusing on energy, housing and government efficiency, his goal now was making Labor's Anthony Albanese the first prime minister in almost a century to be voted out after a single term.
Instead, in a double blow to his political career, he lost the election and his seat in the Queensland electorate of Dixon.
The eldest of five children, Dutton has always been a ""responsible"", ""straight-down-the-line person"", his family say.
He grew up in the suburbs of Brisbane, joining both the Liberal Party and the Queensland Police Force after school - two moves that would shape his world view.
After nine years, including time investigating high-profile violent crimes and a car chase which left him badly injured, he resigned from the force to work with his father on a family business while waitimg for his political breakthrough.
That came in 2001, when he beat Labor frontbencher Cheryl Kernot for the House of Representatives seat of Dickson, catching the eye of then Prime Minister John Howard, who would go on to become Dutton's role model and mentor.
""I was impressed by him from the word go,"" Howard - the nation's second longest-serving leader - told the Good Weekend Magazine in a 2014 profile.
Dutton quickly climbed the ladder, landing his first ministerial position within three years, and by the time the Coalition returned to power under Tony Abbott in 2013, he was one of the leading conservative voices in the party.
He has taken on an array of portfolios, but it is in immigration, home affairs and defence where he really cemented his reputation.
In immigration and home affairs, he strictly enforced Australia's controversial policy of sending all asylum seekers who arrived in the country by boat to offshore detention centres, and aggressively deflected criticism of the strategy.
He became a frequent critic of China, steadily increased the investigative and surveillance powers of federal law enforcement, and as defence minister helped negotiate the landmark Aukus defence pact with Britain and the United States.
Dutton is also known for his stances on tense debates in Australia.
He was among several politicians who boycotted the 2008 national apology to the Stolen Generations - the name given to tens of thousands of Aboriginal children who were forcibly taken from their families under infamous government policies until 1970 - though he now says that was a ""mistake"".
And as opposition leader in 2023, he was instrumental in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum - which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them - arguing the proposal was divisive, constitutionally risky and ultimately would not help improve the lives of Indigenous people.
Dutton has also weathered a string of scandals. He apologised over remarks criticised as racist, been caught on camera appearing to joke about the impact of climate change on the Pacific, and once called a journalist a ""mad witch"" in an expletive-laden text message that he accidentally sent to the journalist herself.
He has long had great ambitions, in 2018 famously challenging Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for the party leadership. Turnbull - who had felled his predecessor Tony Abbott the same way three years earlier - did not have enough votes to win the contest, but neither did Dutton, leaving Scott Morrison to sweep through and take the job of prime minister instead.
Dutton finally ascended to the top job after Morrison led the party to an election wipe-out in 2022.
At the time, polling painted Dutton as deeply unpopular, and some from his own party questioned whether the conservative firebrand could rebuild Liberal support in the moderate areas they lost it.
Dutton insisted the tough jobs he had held in government had made it hard to ""show a softer side or a different side"" to his character.
""All I would say is I'm not going to change, but I want people to see the entire person I am and reserve and make their own judgement,"" he said, in his first news conference as leader.
More recently however, Dutton tried to project a more mellow image, of a shy, family man, who will govern in the style of his still broadly respected mentor Howard.
He opened up about his personal life, revealing struggles with alopecia, a skin condition which causes hair loss, and what he believes is PTSD from his time in the police.
He told interviewers about his first marriage at the age of 22, which lasted only months, and about his daughter who was born from another short-lived relationship and whom he calls ""the best mistake I ever made"". He also has two adult sons with his second wife, Kirrily.
He promised to introduce a government efficiency tsar - like Elon Musk is to America - who would cut public service jobs, also took aim at government diversity and inclusion initiatives. However, he sought to distance himself from gender and abortion debates, and has ruled out withdrawing the country from the Paris Climate Accords.
His flagship policy was a nuclear power scheme which he said would help Australia lower its emissions, offer cheaper power than renewables, and create new jobs, at a cost of A$300bn ($189bn; £146bn).
Nuclear power is currently banned - both at a federal level and by many states - and experts, including Australia's science agency, said Dutton's scheme could not have been delivered within the specified timeframe or for that price. Many argued it was a tactic to delay the country's transition away from the lucrative coal and gas industries.
Lowering the cost of living was also a key part of his pitch to voters. Central to that was a promise to fix the housing crisis by slashing construction red tape, cutting immigration and allowing Australians to dip into their superannuation to buy their first home - though critics say bolder reforms which are electorally unpopular with older, wealthier voters are necessary.
Dutton also matched Labor's promise to fund more free doctor appointments, has said state governments will face pressure to stamp out crime, and that Australia's ""strained"" relationships with the US and Israel will be repaired under his watch.
Albanese argued the coalition under Dutton was ""more conservative than they've ever been"", and accused him of pursuing ""cold-hearted, mean-spirited"" politics which target vulnerable people.
""What I want is a campaign that's about policy, substance, that's about hope and optimism for our country,"" he said when announcing the election, adding that Dutton was ""all about fear"".
Dutton painted Albanese as ""weak"" and ""woke"", and said he has sent Australia backwards - a view the majority of Australians ultimately rejected.
Conceding the election on 3 May 2025, Dutton said it had been an ""amazing honour"" to have served as an MP for more than 20 years and that defeat was ""not the true story of who we are"".
""We have an amazing party. It will rebuild.""

Heritage site set for huge Viking festival,The Viking Festival at the pre-historic site is expected to be the biggest in the UK this year.,4 May 2025,Peterborough,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k0pj57pyo,"A Viking festival believed to be the biggest in the UK this year is being staged at a pre-historic heritage site this weekend.
Flag Fen near Peterborough is hosting the event which runs until Monday and will attract 380 Viking re-enactors from across Britain.
It will feature a battle dating back to the year 1010 - with an Anglo-Danish army from Cambridgeshire and East Anglia facing off against a Viking force.
One of the organisers says the appeal of Viking history is ""universally popular"" and goes down particularly well in the city which has strong Viking heritage.

Jacqui Mooney, the general manager of Flag Fen Archaeology Park, said that while  they do not have Viking archaeology at the Iron Age site, the area around has strong links to the period with nearby Fengate derived from a Viking name.
She said it was a chance for people to learn more about the Viking way of life.
""It's a fun sort of education where you don't realise you are being educated.
""We have had the Viking festival here for over 15 years. It's so successful because the landscape is so perfect because it is protected and untouched, and the re-enactors can tailor the area to how they want.""

Visitors can discover what life was like in a real Viking encampment, learn about their diet and watch traditional crafts such as woodworking, metalworking, cooking and weaving in action.
As part of the event, there is a mock Viking burial which they then excavate to reveal more about how the Vikings lived and died.
Jacqui Mooney said the event was vital to help fund the running of the heritage site.
""Just like most heritage attractions it takes a lot more money to run the site than we get from people coming through the door,"" she said.
""We're always looking at ways to make the site more viable and to protect the archaeology.""

Organisers said the event would feature a re-enactment of the Battle of Ringmere which was fought on 5 May 1010 , as an Anglo-Danish army from Cambridgeshire and East Anglia, faces off against a Viking force commanded by Thorkell the Tall.
It will show re-enactors charging into battle, ""swords flashing and shields clashing, recreating the intensity and drama of ancient warfare"".
But Ms Mooney said it will also show that the Vikings did not just come to Britain to fight and pillage but to settle and make the country their home.

"More than 700,000 trees planted in Surrey",The county is more than halfway towards its goal of 1.2 million by 2030 - one for every resident.,6 days ago,Surrey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9e9y48k1vo,"More than 700,000 trees have been planted in Surrey as the county council aims for 1.2 million saplings by 2030.
In the past year, Surrey County Council said its initiative had created about 49,000 new trees and hedgerows.
This brings the total number of trees planted to 768,832 since 2019 – more than halfway to the county's target of planting one tree for every Surrey resident.
A range of community projects have been supporting the challenge.
Staff at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Dorking took part in a workshop, planting 20 fruit trees and three young oak trees in a new orchard.
Pupils on the eco council at Broadwater School in Waverley learned about the importance of trees and planted 753 trees to create a ""reflection area"".
Meanwhile, an orchard of 10 fruit trees was created at Goldsworth Park Medical Centre in Woking as part of the NHS Forest scheme, which aims to transform green spaces within healthcare sites to improve health, wellbeing and biodiversity.
Marisa Heath, Surrey County Council's cabinet member for environment, said: ""Trees play a vital role in enhancing the appearance of Surrey's green spaces, while also strengthening our climate resilience.
""We couldn't do this alone, so I thank all the partners, communities and residents who support this initiative. I encourage you to continue to do so to achieve our target for the benefit of our communities and future generations to come.""

New 44-acre nature reserve for former dairy farm,The site will be allowed to be reclaimed by nature once it is bought.,24 Apr 2025,Somerset,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0el5qj4xlqo,"A wildlife charity is planning to buy a former dairy farm and allow it to be taken over by nature.
The 44-acre Ebdon Farm near Wick St Lawrence, North Somerset, will be bought by the Avon Wildlife Trust within two years.
The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation charity has purchased the farm and has given the Trust two years to raise the funds to buy it.
Biodiversity surveys have started and the site will eventually be only lightly managed to make it as natural as possible, the trust has said.
Shelly Easton, Head of Nature's Recovery at Avon Wildlife Trust said the site is on low-lying land that is difficult to farm so it needed ""intensive interventions as a dairy farm which left little room for nature"".
She added: ""We plan to create a new climate resilient nature reserve which can help tackle the climate and ecological crises, promoting natural processes and healthy ecological functions.
""The land also sits around two kilometres from the coast, making it the ideal location for the Severn estuary's wading birds and wildfowl to roost when the tide is high.""
Peter Lord CBE, co-founder of Aardman Animations in Bristol, has also been a major donor to the project, says the Trust.
""I had a delightful visit to Ebdon Farm and this project is a wonderful and inspiring one,"" he said.
""I admire the team's knowledge and enthusiasm for the site, and I can't wait to see nature return and thrive here.""
The current phase of the site survey involves setting down rectangles of dark matting at the edge of some of the fields to assess the local reptile population.
""We'll put them out and leave them for a few days,"" said Jenny Greenwood, the charity's monitoring and mapping manager.
""Then we'll come out and check on them and hopefully the reptiles will then come to us!""

Wireless water butt tech helps to limit flood risk,The technology allows for water to be released ahead of heavy rainfall to increase tank capacity.,5 May 2025,Shropshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr78dp4507vo,"Water butts using wireless tech have been rolled out to businesses in Shropshire to help mitigate the risk of flooding.
Shropshire Council is backing the project, The River Severn Partnership Advanced Wireless Innovation Region (RSPAWIR), which it says uses the devices to manage heavy rainfall.
The tanks monitor how much water is stored inside them and can be emptied gradually ahead of downpours to allow for more storage when needed.
A smart water butt capable of holding 10,000 litres of rainwater was recently installed at a defence engineering company in Telford.
""The tanks will collect and store rainwater off the roof at Rheinmetall BAE Systems for industrial use on site and are programmed to release it into the drainage system just ahead of a rainfall event so there is capacity to take pressure off the river when needed,"" the project's programme manager, Matt Smith, said.
Adrian Stones, from the company, said a recent expansion had encouraged it to understand how ""resilient it is to climate change"" including flooding risk.
""We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with the River Severn Partnership and Shropshire Council for helping RBSL tackle flood risk and to assist with preventing flooding beyond our site.""
The system, designed by Sustainable Drainage Systems Limited (SDS), also has benefits during periods of drier weather.
Dr Neil Sewell, Director of New Technology Services at the firm said: ""By 2050, England is projected to require an additional five billion litres of water per day, equivalent to 2,000 Olympic sized swimming pools.
""This is an unsustainable trajectory if we continue relying on conventional drinking water infrastructure alone.
""Yet, a significant proportion of our current usage involves using drinking-quality water for applications that simply don't require it.""
The council received £4m from the government to fund wireless innovation in Shropshire. Mr Smith's team is also working with local farmers to see how the tech could protect against floods in rural communities.
""By extending the project to include the smart water butts to businesses in the catchment area we are able to demonstrate how a similar principle could be applied to manufacturing as well as to agriculture,"" he said.
Mr Smith said he was looking to work with other businesses in the Telford area that had large roof spaces needed for the water collection."
Chilli vs the chiller: Lord Sugar hires new Apprentice,"He bills the battle between Indian-flavoured pizzas and air conditioning as ""chilli vs the chiller"".",17 Apr 2025,Culture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpqg0wdd6o,"Warning: This story contains spoilers about the Apprentice winner
Lord Sugar has hired his newest business partner in the final of the 19th series of The Apprentice.
He had a choice between Anisa Khan, who sells Indian food-flavoured pizzas, and Dean Franklin, who runs an air conditioning company, in a battle he billed as ""chilli versus the chiller"".
The final signalled the end of a bruising 12-week process that started with 18 budding entrepreneurs vying to become Lord Sugar's latest protégé.
In the end, Lord Sugar chose to give his £250,000 investment to Dean, from Essex, despite noting there had been ""a few rocky moments"" where he had only remained in the programme ""by the skin of your teeth"".
""I can't believe I've just won The Apprentice,"" Dean said. ""This is going to mean the world to me and my family. My kids are going to be over the moon.""
He made it through to the final despite having a difficult time in the penultimate episode, the interviews with Lord Sugar's famously tough advisers.
He froze and started laughing after one interviewer, Mike Soutar, challenged his nonsensical claims about climate change, including that there was ""an increase in climate control"" and ""the climate zone is depleting"".
He was also asked about his company's website, which says his engineers would ""always treat your home as if it were their own"". Soutar then produced a picture from Dean's social media showing a sex toy that he had stuck to a customer's air conditioning unit.
In the final, the show's previously fired contestants returned to help Dean and Anisa create advertising campaigns for their companies.
Dean tasked some of his team-mates with making a TV ad - which had to be hastily reshot because it showed someone being persuaded to buy air conditioning to heat up their house, not cool it down.
During the episode, Lord Sugar said air conditioning made Dean an ""honest living"" but he needed to show a ""scalable proposition"".
Ownership of Dean's company was previously split between his existing business partner and their two wives, with each having a 25% share.
Lord Sugar will now be given the wives' 50% in return for his investment.
He asked Dean: ""They'll give it to me and they won't get the hump over that then, will they? They won't make you sleep in the spare bedroom?""
Dean assured him: ""They know the plan. We're still married so what's mine is hers. So it makes no difference.""
The amount Lord Sugar invests has remained the same since 2011, and previous winner Tom Pellereau - the first to receive that sum - said: ""Fourteen years ago, £250,000 went quite a lot further than it does today.
""My controversial point is, I do think they should double the money.
""I think £500,000 or £1m would be an incredible prize,"" Pellereau told BBC Radio 5 Live.
The Apprentice final is available to watch on BBC iPlayer."
Flood victims future-proof their homes,People in Oxford have flood plans in place for when the water levels rise after heavy rain.,23 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgmr1310xo,"Residents in Oxford are flood-proofing their homes as climate change threatens to bring heavier rain and more extreme weather in the future.
Some residents recall that 2007 was the worst year for flooding, when many of them had to move out of their homes.
One business owner, who could not get buildings insurance, turned the ground floor of their building in to a flood plain so water could flow freely inside and out.
Despite the changes many people have had to made to their houses they still get anxious every time it rains.
Simon Collings, who lives on Osney Island in West Oxford, said 2007 was the worst year for flooding.
""Dealing with the aftermath of a flood, particularly if it's been widespread across the country, is very difficult because insurers are under pressure and loss adjusters are under pressure,"" he said.
Mr Collings said he learnt a lot from his experience and now has a flood plan for when the water levels rise.
Where he lives properties are mainly affected by ground water flooding, water comes up from underneath the floor boards.
When water levels are high in the surrounding rivers, he moves furniture upstairs, puts his washing machine and dishwasher on wooden pallets and drops a submersible pump in to the void underneath his flood boards.
Water is then pumped out of the window via a hose and runs out on to the street.
Flood gates are put on the downstairs front and back doors and he then blocks the air bricks at the front of the house.
Jacqui Mangold owns a yoga studio on Osney Island and is unable to get flood insurance.
Because of that they designed the ground floor of the building to let water in and out.
Cupboards are raised on stilts, electric sockets are higher up and there are valves at either end of the building so the water can flow freely.
Ms Mangold said: ""We haven't been flooded here, but we bought a building that was a commercial building, part of the planning constrictions was that the building allows water in.
""In a certain sense, we are the flood plain here.""
Sasha Mlynek, a young mother who lives around the corner from Simon, said the water levels were always on her mind.
""Nothing really prepares you psychologically for what it's like to have to lift up your floorboards and see that your floor is completely flooded through and you're inches from flooding inside and it really scared us,"" she said.
""It would be wonderful if we could get granting to support to put in a permanent pump under floor.
""Climate change is meant that the amount of rain that falls, falls fast and there is a lot of it.""
Richard Powell, chairman at the West Oxford Bowls Club, said they have spent £25,000 on repairs to the club house, caused by frequent flooding over the years.
""We get flooded quite regularly, the green gets about two foot of water on it,"" he said.
""We have all the people come together and try and put the club back together, if we get flooded.""
Along with a number of other members he is currently damp proofing the walls to prevent further damage.
Mr Powell said: ""Bitumen is painted on to the bottom of the building to hopefully stop the water from coming in.""
Robbie Williams from the Environment Agency is the project director for the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme, something some residents believe will help the city in future years.
""This scheme is a nature based scheme that effectively captures all the flood water above Oxford,"" he said.
""It channels it naturally across the west side of Oxford. We're going to create a new stream and a wetland corridor.
""That will keep all the water left, west of Oxford, rather than in Oxford.""
A number of residents aren't happy with the current scheme that is expected to be announced this Spring by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
Chris Sugden from the Hinksey and Osney Environmental Group said he is not against a scheme as such.
He said: ""The channels that they are proposing to drive through beautiful, excellent meadows, which had been here thousands of years doing their job will be totally destructive of wildlife.
""Very rare grasslands cannot be compensated for and cost far too much.""

Council question ban 'death knell for democracy',A review recommends stopping opposition parties from asking questions at cabinet meetings.,24 Apr 2025,Tyne,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48w4jmgjzo,"Proposals to ban opposition party councillors from asking questions at a council's cabinet meetings have been branded a ""death knell for democracy"".
An independent review at Labour-led Newcastle City Council has recommended reforms that include preventing opposition questions at the meetings, where the political leadership makes major decisions.
It also suggested reducing the number of scrutiny hearings and scrapping committees devoted to investigating the council's finances and climate change commitments.
A council spokesperson confirmed the review would be subject to debate at its constitutional committee in May, but any substantial changes would require the approval of the full council.
The council insisted the Centre for Governance and Scrutiny (CfGS) review presented ""impartial"" advice that would not necessarily be implemented.
The CfGS said cross-examination of the council's executive at cabinet meetings ""can detract from the core purpose of the meetings and might easily lead to confusion for public and other observers"".
Independent councillor, Marc Donnelly, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service it was ""the death knell for democracy in Newcastle"".
He said: ""It is taking power away from the people and placing it into the hands of a very small few in the council. It will lead to less scrutiny, less debate and less discussion.""
The CfGS also said the council's remaining scrutiny committees should meet only six times a year rather than 10, claiming that ""fewer, more productive meetings would achieve more and have greater impact"".
Colin Ferguson, Liberal Democrat opposition leader, warned the review ""decimates accountability, erodes scrutiny and centralises decision making away from our communities"".
While Labour has been in charge at the council since 2011, the authority is currently in no overall political control after former leader Nick Kemp and five others quit the party to become independents.
The Labour group, led by Karen Kilgour, said it would meet to consider the recommendations and decide how to proceed.
A spokesperson for the council said the report was commissioned as part of the Newcastle Charter ""to seek impartial, expert advice on how our democratic processes could be improved"".
""This ongoing review, which all members have had the opportunity to help shape, aims to help ensure that our structures and practices reflect a modern organisation, that democratic processes are open and transparent, with effective democratic decision-making processes in place to make the best use of everybody's time,"" they said.

"How Canada party platforms compare on key issues, from the US relationship to housing","In this consequential election, what are the main federal parties' commitments on the major issues?",24 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdx9992r8ko,"Canadians are set to vote on Monday in an election seen as one of the most consequential in years, as the country looks to its future amid a trade war with the US.
So what are the main federal political parties promising?
Their platforms address key issues on the minds of voters, from their approach a suddenly volatile US-Canada relationship to the rising cost of living to energy and climate change.
Here is a breakdown on where each party stands on some of the major issues:
Canada, like many countries, has been grappling with higher prices for everyday goods while wages have failed to keep up, and all the parties are pitching ways to keep more money in the pockets of Canadians.
Both the Liberals and the Conservatives are proposing tax cuts for people in the lowest tax bracket, with the Liberals promising a one-percentage-point cut and the Conservatives proposing dropping the tax rate from 15% to 12.75%.
Conservatives are also in favour of removing the federal sales tax on purchases of all new homes and Canadian-made cars, while the Liberals have vowed to scrap sales taxes on homes under C$1m ($720,000; £540,000) for first-time buyers.
The Bloc Québécois, a party that focuses on Quebec interests and only runs candidates in the province, wants to pass a bill that would increase Old Age Security - benefits for pensioners - payments by 10%. The party also wants to limit credit card interest rates.
The left-wing NDP has proposed scrapping the federal sales tax on essentials like energy, phone and internet bills. It has also vowed to double the income received by Canadians with disabilities.
The main theme of the campaign has been how Canada's next prime minister will tackle a trade war with  its closest economic ally and neighbour, after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty.
Most of the leading federal parties agree on some form of retaliatory tariffs in response to those put in place by the US, though they have different ideas on how the money raised by these levies would be used.
The Conservatives promised to put it towards tax relief, especially for workers affected by tariffs. The Liberals have also said they would use money raised by counter tariffs to help workers and businesses and the NDP vowed to put ""every dollar"" collected towards supporting those affected.
Additionally, the Liberals have said they will spend C$5bn on measures to diversify trade internationally and within Canada and invest in infrastructure like ports and railroads, and C$2bn to protect Canada's auto industry.
The Conservatives are also remove trade barriers between provinces, and will call a meeting with premiers within a month of taking office.
They also want to pursue a trade and mobility agreement with the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
The Bloc has called for pandemic-style support for affected workers and are pushing for more support for Quebec's aluminium industry, which has suffered under Trump's metals levies.
The NDP have proposed a 100% levy on all Tesla products if Trump moves ahead with his full threatened tariffs on all Canadian goods, and to bar the president from the upcoming G7 summit in Alberta in June.
Canada has been criticised - including by President Trump - for lagging behind on its military spending, falling well short of the Nato target (which is 2% of a country's GDP).
Both the Liberals and the Conservatives say they will aim to reach that goal by 2030.
The Liberals say they will spend C$18bn over the next four years, which will go to purchasing new equipment like submarines and heavy icebreakers that can be used in Canada's north.
The Conservatives are pledging C$17bn in that same time frame, and are vowing to build new Arctic military bases in Iqaluit and Churchill, Manitoba.
The NDP has a longer timeline of 2032 for reaching the Nato target. The party would also cancel Canadian contracts for US-built fighter jets and aircrafts, and also bolster and set up new military bases in the north.
Home prices have skyrocketed in the last decade across the country.
The Liberals want to create a standalone federal entity that would act as a developer for affordable housing. Through it, a Liberal government would supply C$25bn in debt financing for prefabricated home builders.
They have also vowed to more than double annual housing starts in Canada to 500,000.
Conservatives want to tie federal funding to cities based on the number of homes they have built. Their goal is to build 2.3 million homes in Canada in the next five years - about 460,000 a year.
Conservatives would also sell off 15% of federal buildings so the land can be used for the construction of affordable homes.
The NDP's platform is focused on building three million affordable homes in the next five years by speeding up approvals and spending C$1bn for the construction of rent-controlled homes.
The party has also vowed to set aside federal land to build a total of 100,000 rent-controlled units by 2035.
One of the Conservatives' key promises was doing away with an unpopular consumer carbon pricing pricing programme put in by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Liberal leader Mark Carney repealed it in his first week as prime minister. A similar tax on large industrial emitters, however, remains in place.
The Liberals have vowed to ""improve"" that tax to maintain the push on reducing emissions while ensuring Canadian companies are still competitive.
They plan to support carbon removal and sequestration technologies and speed approval of clean energy projects.
Conservatives say they will repeal all carbon pricing, which they say will in turn reduce regulations and help boost the economy.
They also want to scrap a cap on oil and gas emissions, and do away with Bill C-69, an environmental assessment act for major infrastructure.
They have promised to bring in a tax credit to boost clean Canadian manufacturing to help lower emissions.
The Liberals, on the other hand, want to build a Canada east-west electricity grid, though Carney has said that he, too, is open to the construction of new pipelines to reduce dependence on the US.
The NDP said they would keep the industrial carbon price, and is against building an LNG pipeline in Quebec.
It also opposes a proposed pipeline that would transfer oil from Alberta to New Brunswick, prioritising an east-west electricity grid instead.
The NDP, the Bloc and the Green Party want to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies while the Bloc wants a cap on oil-and-gas sector emissions.
The Greens additionally want to transition to a fully renewable electricity system by eliminating coal, oil, and gas-fired power generation and invest in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy.
They also want to cancel all new pipelines and oil exploration projects."
Dundee maritime attraction gets £3.55m funding boost,Discovery Point will use the Heritage Fund award to build new exhibition space and a restaurant.,17 Apr 2025,Tayside & Central Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vn30j17po,"A popular Dundee tourist attraction exploring the city's maritime history has been awarded £3.55m for the next stage of its redevelopment.
Discovery Point includes Captain Scott's Antarctic exploration ship RRS Discovery, which is currently undergoing a major restoration project.
The Heritage Fund money will also go towards two new exhibition galleries and a restaurant in its visitor centre.
Dundee Heritage Trust said it hoped the funding would help secure the ship's future as ""one of the world's most-important historical vessels"".
RRS Discovery was purpose-built in the city to take explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott to the Antarctic in the early 1900s.
The ship returned there in 1986 to a permanent home in the city.
Last year the Hope Cross, a poignant memorial to polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton from his crew, went on display at Discovery Point after a journey of more than 7,000 miles from the South Atlantic.
The new attractions add to a 360° virtual recreation of Dundee in 1901 that was opened in the centre in 2022.
The new exhibitions will shed light on the early explorers' fascination with Antarctica and how Discovery's pioneering voyages continue to shape global climate science.
Building work on the project is expected to begin next year and conclude in 2028.
Dundee Heritage Trust chairman David Henry said: ""The next stage of Discovery Point Transformed marks an exciting new chapter in our ongoing mission to preserve and celebrate Discovery's extraordinary legacy.
""By combining innovative exhibitions with essential conservation work, we will ensure that RRS Discovery continues to educate and inspire for the next century."""
Are twins allergic to the same things?,"If one of a pair of twins is allergic to something, does that mean the other twin will be sensitive too?",26 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250425-do-twins-become-allergic-to-the-same-things,"If one of a pair of twins is allergic to something, does that mean the other twin will be sensitive too?
Allergies, whether spring sneezes due to pollen or trouble breathing triggered by a certain food, are caused by a combination of someone's genes and the environment they live in. The more of these things two people share, the higher their chances of being allergic to the same things. Twins are more likely to share allergies because of everything they have in common, but the story doesn't end there.
Allergies are really complex and a lot of factors play a role in who gets them and who doesn't.
Your immune system makes defence proteins, antibodies, whose job is to keep watch and attack any invading germs or other dangerous substances that get inside your body before they can make you sick.
An allergy happens when your body mistakes some usually harmless substance for a harmful intruder. These trigger molecules are allergens. The antibodies stick like suction cups to the allergens, setting off an immune system reaction. That process leads to common allergy symptoms: sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, itchy, watery eyes, and a cough. These symptoms can be annoying but minor.
Allergies can also cause a life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention. For example, if someone ate a food they were allergic to, and then had throat swelling and a rash, that would be considered anaphylaxis.
The traditional treatment for anaphylaxis is a shot of the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the leg muscle. Allergy sufferers can also carry an auto-injector to give themselves an emergency shot in case of a life-threatening case of anaphylaxis. An epinephrine nasal spray is now available, too, which also works very quickly.
A person can be allergic to things outdoors, like grass or tree pollen and bee stings, or indoors, like pets and tiny bugs called dust mites that hang out in carpets and mattresses.
A person can also be allergic to foods. Food allergies affect 4% to 5% of the population. The most common are to cow's milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame. Sometimes people grow out of allergies, and sometimes they are lifelong.
Each antibody has a specific target, which is why some people may only be allergic to one thing.
The antibodies responsible for allergies also take care of cleaning up any parasites that your body encounters. Thanks to modern medicine, people in the United States rarely deal with parasites. Those antibodies are still ready to fight, though, and sometimes they misfire at silly things, like pollen or food.
Hygiene and the environment around you can also play a role in how likely it is you'll develop allergies. The more different kinds of bacteria that you're exposed to earlier in life, the less likely you are to develop allergies. Studies have even shown that children who grow up on farms, children who have pets before the age of five, and children who have a lot of siblings are less likely to develop allergies. Being breastfed as a baby can also protect against having allergies.
Children who grow up in cities are more likely to develop allergies, probably due to air pollution, as are children who are often around people who smoke.
Children are less likely to develop food allergies if they try foods early in life rather than waiting until they are older. Sometimes a certain job can contribute to an adult developing environmental allergies. For example, hairdressers, bakers and car mechanics can develop allergies due to chemicals they work with.
Genetics can also play a huge role in why some people develop allergies. If a parent has environmental or food allergies, their child is more likely to have allergies. Specifically for peanut allergies, if your parent or sibling is allergic to peanuts, you are seven times more likely to be allergic to peanuts.
Back to the idea of twins: yes, they can be allergic to the same things, but not always.
Researchers in Australia found that 60% to 70% of twins in one study both had environmental allergies, and identical twins were more likely to share allergies than fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins only share about 50% of their genes, the same as any pair of siblings.
More like this:
• Climate change is making allergies worse
• Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies
• The science of probiotics and skin
A lot more research has been done on the genetics of food allergies. One peanut allergy study found that identical twins were more likely to both be allergic to peanuts than fraternal twins were.
So, twins can be allergic to the same things, and it's more likely that they will be, based on their shared genetics and growing up together. But twins aren't automatically allergic to the exact same things.
Imagine if two twins are separated at birth and raised in different homes: one on a farm with pets and one in the inner city. What if one's parents smoke, and the others don't? What if one lives with a lot of siblings and the other is an only child? They certainly could develop different allergies, or maybe not develop allergies at all.
Scientists like me are continuing to research allergies, and we hope to have more answers in the future.

Why the trees behind shea butter beauty cream are under threat,One man's struggle to save Uganda's once-profitable trees that produce shea butter.,1 May 2025,Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewge4lvv0o,"A former biology teacher-turned-environmentalist is on a crusade in Uganda to save the once-flourishing trees from which shea butter is made - the cosmetic known as ""women's gold"".
Mustafa Gerima wants local communities to stop chopping down the trees to make charcoal - which they say is more profitable than the oil, also used in cooking, that is extracted from its fruit.
He gave up teaching to dedicate himself to the trees when he returned home six years ago and was shocked to find the Mount Kei Central Forest Reserve, once lush with wild shea trees, had been turned into a near-barren expanse dotted with stumps.
Now nicknamed ""Bwana Shea"" or Mr Shea, he walks from village to village in the north-west of the country rallying people to protect what he sees as a vanishing treasure.
Local people, he said, had lost interest in the trees and began chopping them down as farmers were experiencing failed harvests.
""Thirty years ago, the shea nut tree had a pattern of its production. It flowered in December then by the time it reached April, it would be ready,"" Mr Gerima told the BBC.
""But now because of climate change there is this prolonged drought. Hence it affects the production of shea nuts.""
The growing popularity of charcoal from the shea nut tree has made the situation worse. It is said to burn for longer than other charcoal.
""Our community is affected by poverty. So they look at the tree as a cheap alternative source of income,"" Mr Gerima said.
Uganda is losing an estimated 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of forest cover each year, and a significant portion of that includes shea nut trees, according to the country's environment ministry.
Shea trees grow in the wild from West to East Africa - a vast strip known as the ""shea belt"". But the shea tree population has dramatically  plummeted in recent year, it says.
This loss, combined with the poor harvests, has had a direct impact on people like Mariam Chandiru, a local shea butter producer for many years in the northern town of Koboko.
""We would get good money to take our children to school and take care of our families. But now my business is collapsing, it is a huge setback,"" she told the BBC.
""I used to sell up to five jerry cans of shea oil a week, right now I can only fill two jerry cans at most.""
It has traditionally been women who have gathered the nuts of the shea tree to produce Nilotica shea butter, prized globally for its cosmetic and culinary uses.
Professor John Bosco Okullo, a leading agroforestry expert from Uganda's Makerere University who has been studying shea nut trees for more than two decades, also blames years of widespread insecurity for the problems.
""In the 1990s, communities used to own and protect the shea trees,"" the academic, who is part of a European Union project aiming to conserve and utilise the tree, told the BBC.
This was before much of the north of the country was ravaged by a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, whose fighters were notorious for abducting children - forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves.
The rebels have largely been wiped out, but nearly 20 years of conflict drove people to leave their villages and find safety in camps.
Other communities were affected by dangerous cattle raids - also leading to the displacement of thousands of people in the early 2000s.
""After cattle raiding and civil unrest by the Lord's Resistance Army displaced people, the sense of ownership was lost,"" said Prof Okullo
""When people returned, they adapted to short-term gains like charcoal burning.""
Prof Okullo agrees with Mr Gerima that climate change has further exacerbated the situation.
""The productivity has gone down. The trees are not flowering and fruiting the way they used to. Rain fluctuation has disrupted the shea tree's natural cycles,"" he said.
Rapid urban expansion is another threat.
""Most of these places which used to have shea trees now have new districts, new hospitals, schools,"" Prof Okullo said.
""You find the shea trees are being cut for development. We need affirmative planting. Otherwise, if we are waiting for natural regeneration, it is going to be difficult.""
Despite what seems like a gloomy outlook, Prof Okullo takes heart from campaigners such as Mr Gerima.
The former teacher's most widely known initiative involved a 19-day, 644km (400-mile) walk in 2020.
He trekked from Uganda's capital, Kampala, to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquarters in Nairobi, capital of neighbouring Kenya.
""Right now, there are a lot of NGOs mobilising communities,"" Prof Okullo said.
""People are planting new trees and protecting those regenerating from stumps.
""Some are even using grafting techniques to shorten the juvenile phase - it used to take 15 to 20 years before fruiting, now some trees are fruiting much earlier.""
To meet rising demand and support sustainable supply chains, the professor and his colleagues are embracing technology.
""We are teaming up with our colleagues in computer science and physics to use Artificial Intelligence so that we can map the mature shea trees and try to project the yield,"" he said.
The Ugandan government has also recognised the vulnerability of the shea nut tree. In 2023, it made the cutting down of trees for charcoal illegal.
But enforcement has been patchy.
""There was a presidential order to stop cutting shea trees, but it's been difficult to implement,"" Prof Okullo said.
""The demand for charcoal is highest in urban areas. Those who cut the trees aren't the ones using the charcoal. We need to provide alternative energy sources for cities to reduce the demand.""
For Mr Gerima, it remains a personal issue.
""Seeing people cut the tree has always caused me a lot of pain in my heart,"" he said.
He continues his long walks to raise awareness, speaking to local councils, organising planting drives.
""This must not be one man's issue - it must bring in a concerted effort, a collective responsibility.""
His next steps include launching a grassroots tree-monitoring initiative and partnering with schools to integrate conservation into the local curriculum.
He says his mission is not just to save a tree but to preserve a way of life.
""We need to think about our future generations. If they come and only find stumps, what will they think of us?""

Two penguin chicks born at Newquay Zoo,The two Humboldt penguin chicks hatched in April after their eggs were laid in March.,30 Apr 2025,Cornwall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrzvjp9dx5o,"Two penguin chicks were born at a Cornish zoo recently, keepers have said.
The Humboldt penguin chicks, from separate breeding pairs, both hatched in April after their eggs were laid in March, Newquay Zoo said.
Senior keeper Dan Trevelyan has successfully reared many penguins in his time at Newquay Zoo.
He said the team was thrilled to welcome the chicks but it was a ""critical period"".
""While everything is going well, we're monitoring them closely to ensure they stay healthy and strong,"" he said.
For one breeding pair - Oreo and Humbug - it was their first time as parents.
However, 28-year-old Ebony and her partner of 20 years, Patch, have successfully raised many chicks over the years and are even grandparents to some of the zoo's current penguins.
""Ebony and Patch are experienced and reliable parents who've successfully raised several offspring over the years,"" Mr Trevelyan said.
""It's fantastic to see Oreo and Humbug stepping up as first-time parents.""
The zoo recently held a pool party to celebrate several penguin birthdays, a spokesperson said.
The event included special talk for visitors, behind-the-scenes insights and enrichment activities - a bubble machine to stimulate playful behaviour.
Humboldt penguins are native to Peru and Chile and classed as Vulnerable because of habitat loss, overfishing, and climate change.
Newquay Zoo said the species was part of a coordinated breeding effort across European zoos.
""While the chicks remain safely tucked in their burrows next to the penguin pool, visitors might be lucky enough to catch a glimpse - or even hear a tiny chirp - on their next visit,"" the spokesperson said.

Date set for opening of £50m bypass,West Sussex County Council says the bypass aims to improve travelling and boost the local economy.,24 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywe8wl433o,"A date has been set for the opening of a £50m bypass in West Sussex.
The newly-constructed A284 Lyminster Bypass (North) is due to open to public traffic at 14:00 BST on 9 May.
It was due to open in autumn last year but was delayed due to ""bad weather"".
Councillor Joy Dennis, cabinet member for highways and transport at West Sussex County Council (WSCC), said the ""important new road"" aims to support the local economy and improve the network in West Sussex.
""It will make it much easier to reach Littlehampton and Bognor Regis from the A27 by taking heavy traffic away from Lyminster and Wick villages,"" she added.
The council said the bypass also aims to provide ""better and safer"" routes to Littlehampton for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians.
Built on a flood plain, the new road has a 225m viaduct spanning Black Ditch, an ancient waterway, to allow for potential changes to water levels due to future climate change, the council added.
The bypass is also linked to the provision of 1,260 new homes.
The project was delivered by the council and Jackson Civil Engineering, with partial funding from the Department for Transport.

When Pope Francis received a signed Man Utd shirt,The Greater Manchester Mayor presented the pontiff with the shirt during a Vatican visit in 2023.,21 Apr 2025,Manchester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjlnxjx3w1o,"Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has recalled the moment he handed Pope Francis a signed Manchester United shirt at the Vatican.
Mr Burnham visited the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in 2023 as part of a climate delegation from the region.
Speaking to BBC News after the death of Pope Francis, aged 88, Mr Burnham said the shirt had been a gift from Argentinian Man Utd player Lisandro Martinez.
""[Martinez's] pride in the Pope being from his own country was just obvious, and it was something of a moment to be able to hand over the gift in the heart of the Vatican,"" Mr Burnham said.
Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1936.
He was ordained as a priest in 1969 and became Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992.
He was elected as pontiff, taking the name Pope Francis, in 2013 after the previous pope, Benedict XVI, stood down.
Mr Burnham said he remembered the Pope's face ""lighting up"" when he told him about the work that was being done to help homeless people in Greater Manchester.
He said Pope Francis had ""nodded vigorously as if to say 'Carry on with that, we want more of that'"".
""I hope the church builds on Pope Francis's legacy and chooses a successor very much in his likeness,"" Mr Burnham added.
Pope Francis had been unwell for some time, and was last seen in public on Easter Sunday, when he took part in a service at St Peter's Basilica.
His Easter address was delivered by a member of the clergy. In it, he said: ""There can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.""
Mr Burnham said Pope Francis ""spoke for equality and compassion and for humanity, in a world where we see political leaders target minorities and marginalise people in the search for votes"".
He added: ""He was a leader on the world stage, a voice we needed to hear.""

"Trump deep sea mining order violates law, China says",The US president speeds up permits for a practice opposed by many countries and environmentalists.,25 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v37z333lo,"Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order aimed at stepping up deep-sea mining within US and in international waters.
The move to allow exploration outside its national waters has been met by condemnation from China which said it ""violates"" international law.
Thursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors.
The deep sea contains billions of tonnes of potato-shaped rocks, called polymetallic nodules, which are rich in critical minerals like cobalt and rare earths.
The latest US executive order was issued to ""establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration"", it reads.
The move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters.
Many countries, including China, have delayed issuing permits until countries agreed a framework for how resources could be shared.
""The US authorisation... violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday.
China dominates global production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium.
Trump has been frustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say.
""We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,"" a US official said on Thursday.
To achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in ""areas beyond national jurisdiction"".
The administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (£225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs
The EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out.
Environmentalists and scientists are concerned that marine species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process.
""Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean,"" said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group.
""The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn't restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it,"" he added in a statement released on Friday.
It is not clear how quickly deep-sea mining could begin but one mining company, The Metals Company (TMC), is already in discussions with the US government to obtain permits.
TMC's CEO Gerard Barron has previously said he hopes to begin mining by the end of the year.
Along with others in the mining industry, he disputes the environmental claims made and has argued that the abyssal zone - 3,000m to 6,000m below sea level - has very low concentrations of life.
""Here there's zero flora. And if we measure the amount of fauna [animal life], in the form of biomass, there is around 10g per square metre. That compares with more than 30kg of biomass where the world is pushing more nickel extraction, which is our equatorial rainforests,"" he previously told the BBC.
A recent paper published by the Natural History Museum and the National Oceanography Centre looked at the long term impacts of deep sea mining from a test carried out in the 1970s.
It concluded that some sediment-dwelling creatures were able to recolonise the site and recover from the test, but larger animals appeared not to have returned.
The scientists concluded this could have been because there were no more nodules for them to live on. The polymetallic nodules where the minerals are found take millions of years to form and therefore cannot easily be replaced."
Why Australia's opposition is vying for votes on Chinese social media,Chinese Australians are a crucial group that deserted the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election.,2 May 2025,World,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx4vr5nqr8o,"With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.
And they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.
Nearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.
Grange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy ""to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little"".
""Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,"" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.
Despite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition.
Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.
Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.
And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.
In order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.
A former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.
He is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.
Henry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more ""extensive targeting"" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.
""I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,"" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.
Even non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.
Liberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.
But visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.
The Chinese Australian electorate have become more ""politically mature"", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.
""Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,"" she says.
Some are frustrated that the community is being ""seen merely for votes"".
""When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,"" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.
She points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being ""Chinese spies"".
""This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,"" she says.
These are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.
In the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation.
It is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.
In 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.
A recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the ""so, so important"" relationship between China and Australia: ""It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.""
How the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.
""[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,"" he says.
For some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. ""[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,"" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid."
Extra funding for council's climate change plans,Dorset Council will spend an extra £6m to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a faster rate.,27 Mar 2025,Dorset,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lp0n2jrp0o,"A council has agreed to spend an extra £6m on reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a faster rate.
It will bring Dorset Council's target to become a carbon neutral authority forward by five years to 2035.
With the new funds total spending on climate projects at the council over five years is likely to reach £25m, much of which is expected to come from the government.
Council leader Nick Ireland, who leads the authority's climate change programme, said he was ""confident"" it could meet its own targets five years early.
The decision, made by cabinet on Tuesday, will mean more solar panels, switching street lights to lower energy bulbs, more support for house owners with insulation and more efficient heating systems.
A target of £500,000 could be saved at Charminster Highways Depot through changes to heating systems and insulation.
Replacing old lights with LEDs in council buildings could also save £600,000.
While £2.12m could be saved by installing an extra 2.25MW of solar panels.
Ryan Hope, Liberal Democrat councillor for Weymouth, said it was good to be ""an ambitious council"" that was aiming to ""lead on climate change"".
He added that the sooner the investments were made, the quicker the savings.
But former portfolio holder for climate Ray Bryan said advances in technology might achieve the targets without the additional investment.
Blandford councillor Nocturin Lacey-Clarke raised doubts about what he claimed was the lack of detail for some of the work.
He questioned whether property leased to others by the council, including farms, came under the scope of the council's own plans.
""I wouldn't want us to sign a blank cheque. I would exercise caution,"" he said.

Man sets off on 53-mile walk dressed as a curlew,Matt Trevelyan made the Eurasian curlew costume out of polystyrene and bamboo.,21 Apr 2025,North Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp91knr7ygpo,"A man is walking 53 miles (85km) in a homemade bird costume to raise awareness and funds for conservation projects.
Matt Trevelyan, a farming officer for Nidderdale National Landscape, began the two-day challenge on Saturday and has been walking along the Nidderdale Way.
He crafted the 10ft-long (3m) costume of a Eurasian curlew - Europe's largest wading bird - out of polystyrene and bamboo.
Mr Trevelyan said: ""Those who know me well know I was eventually going to build a giant curlew. She's a real beauty. I wanted to represent curlews well because they're such a beautiful bird.""
The challenge coincides with World Curlew Day on Monday, which was created by Mary Colwell in 2017 to raise awareness of the dangers curlews face due to habitat loss, land-use changes and climate pressures.
Starting in Pateley Bridge, Mr Trevelyan's walk will pass through Middlesmoor, Guisecliff Wood and Brimham Rocks.
He said: ""Nidderdale is really a stronghold for curlews, in fact the whole Pennine chain is a stronghold. But like other former strongholds there's been a huge decline in numbers.
""In the breeding season, getting chicks to fledgling stage is the problem. So curlew are really seriously on the decline.
""The causes of this are changes in the way we manage the landscape, particularly silage making.
""But it's not just farming; farming can be good for curlews. It's also predation – we have a high number of foxes and crows. And on top of that climate change and a whole host of issues.""
Mr Trevelyan used his skills as a former puppet maker to create the costume.
He said: ""The distinguishing thing about a curlew is its wonderful long bill.
""It's got a 4ft-long curved bill, which I'm quite worried about snagging in trees on the way, or tripping over and it snapping, but I've got a splint and I've got strong tape in case that happens.
""It's very lightweight luckily, but I am a bit worried about getting up on the tops because it's quite windy today.
""If it takes off, that's a victory, if I've made something that can fly that's really good news.""

Work set to start on new city flood defences,Offices are set to be demolished and trees chopped down as part of the project.,3 days ago,Derbyshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c057g62gp87o,"Construction work is set to start on the second phase of a major flood defence scheme for Derby.
A new flood wall and floodgates are set to be constructed as part of the Derby Riverside scheme, which aims to protect properties along the east bank of the River Derwent from Causey Bridge to Derwent Bridge.
Workers are also set to demolish riverside office blocks in Stuart Street to create a new riverside green area which Derby City Council says will create more space for flood water to pass through the city in ""a controlled corridor"".
Preparatory work has already started on the site, with contractors set to start demolition and construction in June, the authority said.
A number of trees will be chopped down along the route, which the council says is necessary to allow the defences to be built and to make sure there are no obstructions in the riverside park which is designed to let flood water flow away.
The Derby Riverside scheme aims to protect Breadsall, Darley Abbey Mills Bridge, the area between North Riverside and Meadow Lane, and sites at Derby Junction Railway Bridge, Pride Park, Ambaston and Shardlow from floods.
It is part of the wider three-phase Our City Our River project, which aims to protect an area between Alfreton Road Industrial Estate and Alvaston Park.
The river burst its banks in 2023 and caused widespread flooding along the eastern bank of the Derwent following Storm Babet.
Councillor Carmel Swan, cabinet member for climate change, transport and sustainability, said: ""These works are crucial as we continue to future proof the city against extreme weather and unlock the potential for regeneration along the river.
""We can now look forward to seeing work begin on site in the near future.""

Wetlands site to be restored thanks to cash boost,"The transformation aims to improve the habitat for rare and endangered species, the attraction says.",5 days ago,Lancashire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74z4v3ez0lo,"A key wetland centre which has degraded due to a lack of money is being restored thanks to a funding boost.
Martin Mere Wetland Centre in Burscough, Lancashire, a Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) reserve, aims to use the money to improve the habitat for rare and endangered species, wetland grassland and reedbeds, boost flood resilience and water quality.
The three-year project is being funded by the CMA CGM Group, maritime, a land, air, and logistics solutions firm, with UK staff also helping do some of the work.
John Blessington, of CMA CGM, said it was ""incredibly proud"" to be funding the revamp of the site which attracts 200,000 visitors a year.
Martin Mere which opened to the public in 1975 is a designated SSSI (site of special scientific interest), an SPA (special protection area) and a Ramsar Site (a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention).
However, it said a lack of funding and deteriorating water quality had degraded the wildlife habitat and significantly reduced its biodiversity.
The restoration of the 600-acre (2.4 sq km) site will include:
Staff at CMA CGM UK, which has its head office in Liverpool, will also be involved in volunteering.
Some employees have already taken part in scrub clearance and rebuilding hedges.
The partnership with WWT is part of the firm's commitment to support large-scale environmental initiatives that boost biodiversity .
Mr Blessington said: ""Wetlands are vital to help fight the climate and biodiversity crises.
""The centre is known to many of our staff who have fond memories of school trips there and they are looking forward to learning more and being part of the site's transformation.""
Louise Greenwood, reserve manager at WWT Martin Mere, said: ""Each year, our wetlands at WWT Martin Mere provide a safe sanctuary for over 100,000 wetland birds and give visitors a chance to see this breathtaking wildlife up close.
""We're delighted to welcome CMA CGM as a partner to join us on our mission to restore and protect these vital habitats and make sure more people can connect with nature and appreciate its wonders.""

Community groups called on to run sports pavilion,Woking Borough Council is calling on community groups to apply to run the West Byfleet Pavilion.,2 days ago,Surrey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39xnpvev4wo,"Voluntary and community groups are being given the opportunity to take on the running of a Surrey sports pavilion as a bankrupt council aims to make savings.
West Byfleet Pavilion is the latest community asset to be handed over by Woking Borough Council.
The arrangement sees land or buildings leased to independent groups which then manage the asset.
Woking effectively declared itself bankrupt in 2023, and final decisions on the treatment of its £2bn debt are expected to be taken by government in June.
Community centres were prioritised for transfer from the council to be run by independent groups.
Even if the council sold everything it owned it would still be more than £1.5bn in debt, a report previously found.
The pavilion, in West Byfleet Recreation Ground, has flexible indoor space suitable for a variety of community uses, and access to outdoor sports pitches and green space, according to the council.
Ellen Nicholson, portfolio holder for climate change and leisure on the council, said it was a ""fantastic opportunity"" for a local organisation to run the pavilion, ""ensuring this much-loved community space continues to serve local residents for years to come"".
She said the programme aimed to empower local groups to ""deliver services that matter most to them"".
""We particularly welcome partnership applications that reflect the vibrant sports community and diverse range of organisations already associated with the site,"" she added.
The deadline to submit an expression of interest is 17:00 BST on 13 June.

Stately home supports No Mow campaign,The stately home is allowing wildflowers to bloom in its lawns for the month of May.,1 day ago,Lincolnshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q0g7g5wr1o,"Gardeners at a National Trust property taking part in the No Mow May campaign have said they ""can't praise it highly enough.""
The national initiative urges people to let wildflowers bloom for the entire month, which creates a habitat for pollinators and a food source for birds and animals, according to Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust.
Belton House, near Grantham, is letting part of their grounds grow wild.
Damian Mitchell, head gardener, said: ""It's a fantastic opportunity to see what you've got lying in the seedbank of your garden.""
May marks the onset of summer and is the start of the wildflower season, national charity Plantlife said.
The gardening team at Belton House, near Grantham, said visitors love to see the contrast between the landscapes.
Mr Mitchell added: ""We still have those lovely, manicured lawns that people expect at large houses, but then as they move out into the wild areas they see all of these fantastic blooms and insects.
""We don't have any negative comments, because people really get what we're doing.""
A spokesperson from Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust said: ""Increasing insect numbers and biodiversity is an important part of tackling climate change.
""Changing the way we treat our gardens is one of the best ways we can all get involved.""
About 97% of flower-rich meadows have been lost since the 1930s, according to Plantlife.

Major roadworks scheme to start in May,National Highways has announced that the upgrade will start on 19 May.,7 days ago,Nottinghamshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq808vy3d59o,"Roadworks on a major route through Nottingham, which are expected to last a year, will start this month.
National Highways said works between the Priory and the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) roundabouts on the A52 Derby Road will begin on 19 May.
The agency hopes the scheme, which includes resurfacing the road, will make journeys ""safer and smoother"" for drivers.
Nottingham City Council leader Neghat Khan said the upgrade would make it easier to get around the city.

National Highways will build a combined cycleway and footway on the eastbound side of the A52 during the work.
The scheme also involves rebuilding parts of the ageing drainage system as well as upgrading street lighting, bus stops and pedestrian crossings on the road section.
Khan added: ""It's a big step towards building a better-connected, climate-resilient Nottingham where modern infrastructure supports healthier lifestyles, strengthens our economy and meets the needs of future generations.""
National Highways said the westbound carriageway will be closed for the first four months of the work, followed by the closure of the eastbound carriageway.
Programme development manager Ian Doust said: ""By doing all of this work at the same time we can significantly reduce the number of road closures and amount of roadworks needed.""
The work is set to be complete by spring 2026, although an exact date is yet to be confirmed.

Wildlife trust's call to protect hoverfly 'heroes',The International Union for the Conservation of Nature classes hoverflies as a threatened species.,20 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1me8jzjerlo,"A wildlife trust has called on gardeners to help protect and save hoverflies.
The Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT) and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said hoverflies are the second most significant pollinator after bees.
They are also food for birds and help break down gardens' organic matter but intensive agriculture, pesticides and climate change have meant their population has declined, BBOWT and the RHS said.
In 2022, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature added hoverflies to its Red List of threatened species.
""Hoverflies are a tiny but essential part of the natural world,"" Andy Coulson-Phillips, BBOWT's principal ecologist, said.
""They are vital for pollinating both wildflowers and garden plants alike, so we'd love everyone across our three counties to invite them into their gardens or outside space.""
Stingless hoverflies are often mistaken for wasps, bees or hornets. Common species include Batman, Footballer and Marmalade, named after their distinctive markings and colours.
Hoverflies have only one pair of flight wings but bees and wasps have two.
They can be easily identified by their behaviour, rather than the way they look, because they hover or zigzag around plants.
Vicki Hird, strategic agriculture lead for The Wildlife Trusts, said hoverflies are the ""hidden heroes of our gardens and countryside"".
""Whatever their shape, size or disguise, they are critical for our food security,"" she added.
The RHS's senior wildlife specialist, Helen Bostock, said the gardening charity wants people to ""open their garden gates to hoverflies this summer"".
She said: ""Gardeners can help attract them by planting open, easily accessible flowers.
""In spring, they'll be drawn to aubretia. In summer, they'll love blackberry flowers, oxeye daisy, marigolds, fennel, cow parsley and poppies. Come autumn, they can be seen on heather, aster and even common ivy.""

Passengers invited to try out new rail system,Passengers will be able to take a ride on the battery-powered vehicle along a 220m test track.,5 May 2025,Coventry & Warwickshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygn69p943o,"People can have a go on Coventry's Very Light Rail system after bookings opened for a free ride on the test track.
Those rides are taking place over four weeks from the end of May and passengers will be able to travel along a 220m (241yds) stretch between Greyfriars Road and Queen Victoria Road, the city council said.
That will be the first chance for people to experience travelling on the battery-powered vehicle, the council said.
The test vehicle can take up to 17 seated passengers and there is space for a wheelchair or pushchair. Once the system is operational, the vehicle will be able to hold 60 passengers, seated and standing.
The council has described the system as like a tram but more flexible and affordable than a tram - and an alternative to cars.
Councillor Jim O'Boyle said: ""Coventry Very Light Rail is just one part of our plans to revolutionise transport in our city, tackle climate change, improve air quality and provide a new reliable and accessible travel option.""
The free rides have been organised so people can provide feedback on the experience, the authority said with bookings able to be made online.

EV charging points approved for 20 car parks,"The EV points will be in car parks near residents with no off-road parking, Kirklees Council says.",7 days ago,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp919p9j4e2o,"At least 20 car parks in the Kirklees district will be fitted with new electric vehicle charging points after plans were given the go-ahead by the council.
The points would be located at council-run car parks, aimed at residents with no off-road parking, the authority said.
The £2.5m project is being funded by the government and is the first phase in improving infrastructure for electric vehicles across the region, a spokesperson said.
Councillor Moses Crook, the council's deputy leader and cabinet member for transport and highways, said: ""These new chargers mean that if someone wants to make the switch to an electric vehicle, it will be a more practical option.""
Installation of the charging points was expected to begin later this year, the council said.
Meanwhile further expansion into on-street locations was planned for later phases of the scheme.
Crook said the pilot scheme was ""a critical step in making electric vehicles more accessible"".
""We know many households without off-street parking are currently limited if they have an electric vehicle,"" he added.
The initiative was also part of the local authority's plan to become net zero and ""climate ready"" by 2038, a spokesperson said.
Councillors had previously heard that chargers would need to be installed in three priority locations before the others could be put in.
These were on Spring Wood Street in Huddersfield, New Street Car Park in Honley and Shaw Cross Community Centre in Dewsbury.
EV points would then be installed in Batley, Birstall, Dewsbury, Holmfirth, Huddersfield, Cleckheaton, Heckmondwike, Netherton, Denby Dale, Cowersley, Skelmanthorpe, Emley, Liversedge and Moldgreen.
The council said although it did not intend to charge for the use of parking bays while charging, the authority or EV leaseholders may eventually decide to introduce a payment or require a permit for the bays in future.

Interactive art trail explores life by the sea,The trail aims to tell the stories of Devon families with a strong connection to the sea.,5 days ago,Devon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4v94q37l4o,"A new interactive art trail aims to tell the stories of Devon families with a strong connection to the sea.
The Voices of the Exe Trail, created by the University of Exeter's Resilience of Coastal Communities project, features 10 markers across Exmouth.
Each marker tells a different story and uses audio clips accessible by scanning a QR code.
A mural to celebrate the trail was designed and painted by Exmouth artist Gary ""Garf"" Cook on the side of The Strand Inn pub in the town.
The launch event for the trail will take place from 15:00 BST at Bumble and Bee in Exmouth's Manor Gardens.
The trail will be in place until October 2026 and it is wheelchair accessible, said organisers.
Dr Louisa Evans, from the university, said: ""Our coastal communities are vital for the UK's island identity but also hotspots of deprivation and at the forefront of risks from climate change.
""We spoke to families who represent the resilience of coastal communities, but these oral histories often get parked in a museum and forgotten.""
The trail was a partnership with Exe Estuary Management Partnership, Exmouth Town Council and Mindfully Wired Communications.
It was funded by the Sustainable Management of UK Marine Resources programme.
The family of Debra Quine, who runs cafes in Exmouth, is one of those featured in the trail.
Ms Quine said: ""I've met people in my cafes who have never seen the sea before and the look on their faces and the impact it has is amazing.
""I'm delighted to be part of the Voice of the Exe Trail and hope these stories give people an insight into what life by the water is like.""

How can I reduce my water usage?,BBC South's environment correspondent Jon Cuthill looks at his own water footprint.,29 Apr 2025,Hampshire & Isle of Wight,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg181pjp3po,"I'm BBC South's environment correspondent and I have something to admit - I have no idea how much water I use each day.
Have you ever thought about your water usage? I mean, really thought about it?
From the washing to the cooking, the dishwasher to the hosepipe, the shower to the dog bowl.
A survey by Water UK found 46% of people thought their entire household used 20 litres (four gallons) of water a day.
But in reality, for the average household in the UK it's more than 500 litres (110 gallons).
Dr Julia Brown, associate professor in sustainable environmental management at the University of Portsmouth, thinks there's a lack of understanding across the UK.
""I think in this country our levels of water literacy are just chronically low,"" she said.
""I don't think it's necessarily our fault, I just think it's something we take for granted.""
The pressures on our water supplies in the south of England are ever-increasing.
New housing developments need supply and climate change is stressing our rivers and aquifers.
Even reading this article has an impact - computer servers need cooling and as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more embedded in our daily lives, the internet is becoming increasingly thirsty.
Thames Water has been talking to the government about the challenges of water demand in relation to data centres and how it can be mitigated, the BBC understands.
While lately the spotlight has been on the amount of raw sewage going into our rivers and seas, Dr Brown says the focus should be more about reducing our water consumption.
The National Audit Office has recently predicted a five-billion-litre daily shortfall by 2050, based on current usage.
""There isn't a week that goes by where there isn't something in the media about waste water,"" Dr Brown says.
""And that's hugely important – I think we need to hold water companies to account undoubtedly.
""But we're losing sight of the fact that the more fresh water we use in our homes the more waste water we are putting into the system.""
The average Southern Water household of four people uses about 160,000 litres (35,195 gallons) of water a year. Of that, 148,000 litres (32,555 gallons) is treated as waste.
In order to reduce the amount of water we use, we first need to work out our water footprint - that's how much we're using.
And when it comes to water, it turns out our feet have been changing size.
In the 1960s, average water consumption was 85 litres (19 gallons) a day per person. By 2002, that had increased to 155 litres (41 gallons).
Although the amount of water we use on average has fallen slightly, currently at around 139 litres (34 gallons), it's still higher than comparable countries like Germany.
Technology is playing a part in reducing consumption with the advancement of eco programmes for dishwashers and washing machines.
But at 50 litres (11 gallons) on average per clothes wash, some are calling for us to reduce how often we clean our clothes.
In France, the government-backed organisation the Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) kicked up a stink by suggesting jeans could go 30 days before a wash, t-shirts could be worn five times and even gym kit could be worn three times before hitting the laundry bin.
Showering accounts for about 40% of the average household's daily water usage, according to Wessex Water.
And while a long hot shower may help de-stress, anything longer than 10 minutes will use more than the average bath.
As for baths, which on average use 80 litres (18 gallons) of water, every inch lower saves about 5 litres (1 gallon).
The installation of water meters should make understanding how much we use per household more straightforward.
But measuring the impact we have on our water supplies is more complicated.
To accurately calculate my water footprint, I need to take into account not only what I use at home, but what I also buy.
It is known as ""virtual water"", an idea first originated by Prof Tony Allan, a geographer at King's College London.
Dr Brown says water is involved in producing most of the things we buy.
""So our household water footprint we can calculate by looking at what we do within the home,"" Dr Brown says.
""But we can also factor in, for example, the clothing we use and buy as well as particularly the food that we're consuming.""
It turns out a lot of water goes into making our food.
A 200g (7oz) tray of tomatoes grown in a hot climate like Spain needs around 16 litres (4 gallons) of water.
Avocados can require anything between 140 litres (31 gallons) and 260 litres (57 gallons) each.
Meat such as grain-fed beef is even more water intense. A 250g (9oz) steak needs over 3700 litres (814 gallons) over the three years it takes to produce.
And it's not just food with a water footprint. Oxfam estimates one cotton t-shirt requires 2,700 litres (594 gallons) of water to produce.
While I'm learning there are lots of ways I can reduce how much water I use, there's one issue that all water company customers are only too aware of - leaks.
The question of: ""Why am I trying to save water if it's already being wasted?"" is one that surfaces every time.
According to figures released by the government, the national average of leaks across water companies in England between 2023 and 2024 was just under 46 litres (10 gallons) per person.
But as water companies in our region invest to make our supplies more resilient in the future, the bottom line is water is a finite resource.
And Dr Brown believes our attitudes to it must change.
""I think we're sleepwalking into this in many ways,"" she says.
""And I think we really need to be more mindful about our water, where it comes from, the impacts we're having locally and also globally as well.""
Join us tonight on BBC One from 18:30 BST, when South Today will be live from the River Thames in Streatley, Berkshire, for a special programme about water.

New Reform councillor promises no quick fixes,Reform UK's performance wiped out a Conservative majority held for nearly 30 years.,4 May 2025,Kent,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9ekx3mz4yo,"A newly-elected Reform UK councillor in Kent has said the party is ""not going to fix all the problems straight away"".
The party secured a majority of 45 seats on Kent County Council at the local election on Friday, all but wiping the Conservatives off the political map at the authority.
David Wimble, who was elected councillor for Romney Marsh with 64% of the vote, said: ""We need to be realistic about what we can and can't do.""
Appearing on Politics South East, he said: ""I think the biggest worry is that they will expect to go in and make changes straight away and all of the panel here today know that's just not possible.""
He added: ""Somebody stopped me today and said 'when are you going to stop the boats then?'. This is the county council.""
Some Reform UK leaflets delivered in Kent did feature national party messaging, including a pledge to ""stop the boats"".
When challenged about this promise, Mr Wimble said he focused his campaign purely on local issues and on ""the things that we can do"".
The new councillor sought to temper expectations, emphasising that the new cohort would need time to get up and running.
He said: ""People are saying 'what are you going to do on day one?'.
""Well, it's not easy to do anything as a snap decision. Our party is made up of 57 new members, of those 57, I think six of us have had previous political experience.""
Mr Wimble rejected concerns over lack of experience.
""All the [candidates] that have been elected have got experience of running their own businesses,"" he said.
""They've had the problems of paying the wages at the end of the month. They've got the problems with the rates and council tax and things like that.""
Meanwhile, the outgoing Conservative leader of the council, Roger Gough, urged Reform UK to take the issues facing the authority ""seriously"".
Speaking directly to Mr Wimble, Mr Gough said: ""The county is now in your hands. What I would say is, please take the issues on that seriously.
""Because ultimately, issues like equality and diversity, climate change, they are tiny amounts of expenditure in the context of the council compared with the really big issues – adult social care, children's social services, special educational needs – those are the things that any successful council is going to have to grapple with.
""That's going to be the way to build a secure future for the county and the council.""
Mr Wimble said the party ""takes it all very seriously"".
The local Reform UK party will meet this week to vote for a council leader.
Mr Wimble has thrown his hat in the ring and said he would like to share the position with another councillor.
The new leadership would be in place by ""next weekend"", he added.

Mayor reveals schools receiving green scheme money,"City Hall said the scheme could save schools an average of almost £15,000 on their energy bills.",14 Apr 2025,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn4pewq4lo,"The mayor has revealed which London schools will benefit from his £2.9m Greener Schools programme, which aims to install solar panels, heat pumps and other technology across the capital.
A total of 38 schools in 16 boroughs will receive funding through the pilot, with councils contributing an extra £9.6m to the project, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
City Hall said it believed the scheme could save schools an average of almost £15,000 on their energy bills as a result of the measures, which also include insulation and LED lighting.
The funding will also enable sustainability projects to take place, such as water conservation initiatives, the Sir Sadiq Khan's team said.
Schools in Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington Kensington & Chelsea, Lambeth, Lewisham, Newham, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and Westminster have been selected for the scheme.
Sir Sadiq said he hoped to eventually see the project adopted by the government as part of a scaled-up national scheme.
He argued if all of London's schools were to use similar energy-saving interventions, this could save over £50m annually from the education budget.
The mayor's office pointed out the scheme has inspired aspects of the government's Great British Energy project, which it announced last month would see rooftop solar panels installed at 200 schools and 200 hospitals.
""This investment will help schools reduce their energy costs, so they can spend more on vital resources such as books, technology and staff, and cut carbon emissions so schools can play their part in tackling air pollution in the capital,"" Sir Sadiq said.
""Working with the boroughs, we've been able to leverage a further £9.6m to fund more vital projects in more schools, helping to meet our target of achieving net zero by 2030, as we continue working to build a greener and fairer London for everyone,"" he added.
Executive headteacher Helen Bruckdorfer, from one of the schools taking part in the initiative, Brecknock and Torriano Federation, said: ""This funding will help us enhance energy efficiency and implement sustainable solutions, such as solar PV and LED lighting.""
She added: ""Addressing climate change and promoting sustainability are fundamental to the partnership between Camden Council and its schools, and this initiative is a significant step toward a greener, more sustainable future for our community.""
Headteacher at Durants School, Rachel Carli, said the school is ""committed to supporting the health of our planet"" and the funding ""will play a pivotal role in advancing the goals outlined in the Enfield Schools Climate Action Plan"".
The 38 schools to get funding from the mayor's Greener Schools initiative are:
Hunters Hall Primary School (Barking and Dagenham)
Village Infants' School (Barking and Dagenham)

Funding cut is 'catastrophic' for dance company,Echo Echo Dance Theatre Company's say their funding application for more than £112K was rejected.,6 days ago,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6y335g16o,"A Londonderry dance company has said they will have no other option but to close after 100% of their funding was cut.
Echo Echo Dance Theatre Company said their funding application for more than £112,000 was rejected by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI).
""If this decision stands, it will be terminal for the company,"" Echo Echo artistic director Steve Batts said.
In a statement, ACNI said it is their policy not to provide details of the reasons for an applicant's rejection from any scheme to a third party, unless the rejected applicant granted permission for such disclosure.
The spokesperson confirmed that Echo Echo's application to the 2025/26 Annual Funding Programme (AFP) was unsuccessful.
They said that following this decision, the organisation was offered an award of more than £28,000 to assist with its transition out of the AFP portfolio.
""We want to reassure the dance community in Northern Ireland that public investment in dance in the Derry city and the north west region remains a priority and we will be working to ensure that provision for dance continues,"" the spokesperson added.
Organisers from Echo Echo said they met ACNI officials earlier this week, but were disappointed with the outcome of the meeting.
The Derry dance company said the funding would have covered the wages of three staff members as well as some overheads.
""This is a terrible decision with no basis in fact or reason,"" Mr Batts told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme.
""Full-time jobs will be lost, artists will lose employment opportunities, confirmed projects with funding in place are now at risk, and a bespoke arts centre will close.
""We have read the detailed feedback provided on the Arts Council application, and we will contest this in the strongest possible manner.
""We will not take this decision lying down and will do everything in our power to keep the doors of Echo Echo open for our amazing artists.""
Kelly Quigley is a freelance dance artist, but the majority of the dance classes she teaches are contracted through Echo Echo and take place in the studio on Magazine Street in the city.
""I am in utter shock. I just cannot believe that a company of this magnitude and reach could have its funding cut so unceremoniously,"" she said.
""It is really disheartening to see the work of local artists being placed in jeopardy.
""We should be celebrating the fantastic talent in the city, not doing things that could potentially harm it.
""I don't think people realise the ripple effect these cuts could have — particularly if this building has to be sacrificed.
She said it would ""impact people not just here in Derry, but in Belfast, across Ireland, and even in Europe"".
Majella Bernard said that, for her, the dance classes she attends are incredibly important for her mental health.
""Taking part in Echo Echo classes for the past 12 years has been my salvation and has opened a door to the creative arts in my life that was never there before,"" she said.
""The sense of community and family here makes it one of Derry's most welcoming and inclusive places.
""I'm devastated that we will be losing a large chunk of our funding — it is a brutal blow,"" she said.
""Cutting a vital lifeline for an arts group in the current financial climate makes no sense,"" she added.
A spokesperson for the Arts Council said representatives met Echo Echo on Tuesday.
""At that meeting, we provided information on the funding review process, which the group may choose to access,"" the spokesperson said.
""This information is also linked in the group's rejection letter, and Echo Echo indicated their intention to request a formal funding review in due course."""
What did Canadian voters make of the big debate?,Seven voters across the political spectrum took us into their thoughts after watching candidates debate.,19 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99pg5yg0e3o,"Canada's election campaign has ramped into top gear with voting day just over a week away.
The leaders of major parties participated in debates on Wednesday (in French) and Thursday (in English), pitching their visions for the future of the country during an uncertain time.
On stage were Liberal leader Mark Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh and the Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet.
The BBC has spoken to seven voters who watched Thursday's debate, as they work out who to cast their ballot for on 28 April. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.
Kim, 36, said she liked that the leaders focused on substance during the debate, and found Mark Carney to be a breath of fresh air.
Today's debate was surprising in terms of the dynamic between the candidates. I think it was a bit more centred around content than blaming one another.
I find it refreshing that Carney is not a career politician, and it showed in the debate. The way he spoke was business-like - in both the French and English debates - and he was able to express his points very clearly compared to practiced politicians.
Pierre Poilievre felt like a broken record, constantly looking at the camera to send his message. It was like watching an advertisement.
My values align with the NDP, but I don't think Singh can be a leader for the Canadians. So my vote is still for Carney, as I think he has the best plan.
John, who is 64 and works in construction, was disappointed by the overall quality of the debate but said the Conservative leader was the clear winner.
The debate was all very respectful. I didn't get a sense that anyone was having a go at each other, unlike in the good old days of hot-headed debate - those days seem to be over.
Pierre Poilievre was the winner at the end of the day. I don't think there was a big difference between him and Carney, but Poilievre was better for sure.
Poilievre made some good points, pointing to the nine-and-a-half years of the Liberals in power and the catastrophic mess they've made. Carney tried to pitch himself as some kind of Lancelot figure, but didn't come across as different to what was there before.
At the end of it, I was disappointed. I didn't feel anyone left the table with a phenomenal finish.
Thomas, 29, has lived in the UK and is voting in his first Canadian election.
I think it was a pretty good debate, and nothing too crazy was said. The Liberal and Conservative leaders stayed on track, sticking to their initial messages.
The loser of the debate was Jagmeet Singh. He came across a bit desperate and frantic in the way he was trying to attack on multiple fronts.
The key thing that stood out for me was that all the leaders were emphasising a strong Canada in the face of foreign influence.
My big concerns were the environment, the cost of living and a strong Canada - they addressed those issues well, although I don't think anything new was brought up.
On the whole, the debate was civil, useful, and very Canadian.
54-year-old Thierry said the debate highlighted the contrast in rhetoric between the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada.
Pierre Poilievre showed a more prime ministerial attitude today, rather than being the attack dog he has been over the past few months.
But his pre-formatted spiel was very annoying - it was as if he was trying to beat it into voters that 10 years of Liberal government was bad for Canada.
We also saw a Mark Carney who was very confident, very respectful, quite the opposite of what the Conservative party has shown so far in mimicking the Republican party in the US in terms of rhetoric.
The standout moment was when Mark Carney told Poilievre that the carbon tax and Trudeau were ""both gone"" - to me that was akin to a smash that is unexpected in a tennis match. A highlight, and a very effective and honest response.
Lindsey, a 61-year-old retired civil servant, was impressed with the performance of Yves-Francois Blanchet.
This debate reinforced a few things, but didn't change anything.
From a western Canadian perspective, the Bloc Quebecois leader had a few good comments. I liked that he said he was willing to work within the Canadian federation as long as Quebec's sovereignty is respected. It's not something we understand in western Canada.
He's not someone I'll be able to vote for, but I was impressed by his performance.
The 57-year-old university professor said the debate reinforced his feeling that Canada is in good hands whoever is elected.
I'm personally confident that either Pierre Poilievre or Mark Carney are capable leaders, and I'm not worried about whether the wrong person wins.
I'm more worried about the next year when the world might be on fire, as Trump seems prepared to make such extreme moves. Nothing is off the table with him.
If we go into a crisis, I'm sure Poilievre and Carney will put aside their differences and work together and do the job as well as it can be done.
So to the extent that Canada can be well prepared in the face of this looming threat, I'm confident that whoever the leader is is going to be able to manage it as well as it can be managed.
41-year-old Adrienne said the debate showed off the strength of Canada's democracy, but hoped for more of a concrete discourse on climate policy.
I am proud of the quality of the debate - it was respectful, dignified dialogue between high-calibre politicians. Canada has once again demonstrated to the world that it is a strong, multi-party democracy.
Mark Carney's idea of free trade in Canada by Canada day is a winning policy, and the concept of a national bureau to address the housing crisis - which was mentioned during the French debate - is one that should be explored.
But I found it difficult to relate to the picture that the Conservative leader was painting of the current Canadian experience in the sense that there is widespread chaos and crime.
I wish there was more in the public discourse about the climate crisis and that leaders had to commit to climate action. I agree that Canada could be a clean energy superpower, but that they made no commitment was a little disappointing - which could have happened had the Green party been invited.
In the lead-up to election day, BBC Voter Voices is hearing from Canadians around the country about what matters to them."
Scotland's most remote railway adventure,"Running from Inverness to Britain's most northerly junction, the Far North Line passes through sheep meadows, traditional villages and the world's only Unesco-listed blanket peat bog.",27 Apr 2025,Travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250423-scotlands-most-remote-railway-adventure,"Running from Inverness to Britain's most northerly junction, the Far North Line passes through sheep meadows, traditional villages and the world's only Unesco-listed blanket peat bog.
As the train pulls out of Inverness Station, bound for the utmost reaches of the Scottish Highlands, a familiar thrill tingles through my fingers. Having once called the area home during four summer work seasons, I still feel an unshakable connection to this remote, untamed scenery. And now, at last, I have returned to unite two of my great passions – the romance of rail travel and the peaty moorlands of northern Scotland – in one journey.
It's 07:00 and I'm on the Far North Line that stretches from Inverness to Thurso and Wick at the very tip of mainland Britain. Covering 168 miles and taking around four hours, it's the northernmost railway in Scotland, cutting through the Flow Country; a blanket peat covering much of the northern Highlands. Studded with bog pools and home to a vast array of unique flora and fauna, the Flow Country is the largest and most intact peat system in the world. In 2024, it was named the world's first and only peatland Unesco World Heritage Site. But, for me, the Flow Country's true appeal is its ethereal remoteness.
The sun has blanketed the Highlands for most of my visit, but now, the ground is covered with a dusting of frost that twinkles lightly in the early morning glow. As the train chugs past the village of Conon Bridge and the quaint port town Invergordon, the landscape stays gentle, with hills and farmland rolling past my window. There's no convivial chatter; an early morning start in northern Scotland means people silently clutching their takeaway coffee cups, perhaps preparing mentally for the day ahead. Gazing out of the window, I see a train passing, heading to Inverness. I am going in the opposite direction, deeper into the Highlands, where hurry always seems to fade away.
The Far North Line was built in stages in the late 19th Century, driven by a more pragmatic goal than my quest for remote landscapes. The tracks were created to boost trade, particularly in fishing and agriculture. The first terminus, Dingwall, opened in 1862, followed by Invergordon the next year. Golspie was reached in 1868, Helmsdale three years later, and finally, Thurso and Wick in 1874.
However, the line's creation was not without its struggles. Harsh weather, tricky terrain and financial difficulties threatened its completion.

The Duke was eager to build a railway that, conveniently, would run close to his doorstep, Dunrobin Castle. On 20 June 1870, an Act of Parliament granted him permission to extend the line from Golspie to Brora and on to Helmsdale. But construction had already begun in anticipation, and by 1 November that year, the Dunrobin-to-Helmsdale section was operational.
Today, Dunrobin Castle Station is one of the Far North Line’s most enchanting stops. Designed in 1902 by L Bisset, its Alpine cottage-like architecture evokes scenes from a Grimm Brothers fairy tale. But on my journey, the train swishes past the station, a humble request stop where passengers press a button should they wish to board.
Soon after Dunrobin, the train reaches the seaside. The 10 miles between Brora and Helmsdale are among the journey's most scenic. I see waves crashing against the shoreline's jagged black stones, sheep grazing on the green fields and a man with two border collies on their morning walk. Then, after Helmsdale, the tracks turn inland, deeper into the Highlands. We are now approaching the Flow Country.
The blanket bog covers 1,544 sq m, about 2.5 times bigger than the metropolitan area of London. When it was inscribed by Unesco, it joined other natural marvels like Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the Galápagos islands on the Unesco list because, as the organisation states, it's ""home to a distinct combination of bird species and displays a remarkable diversity of features not found anywhere else on Earth"".
Earlier that week, I met with Dr Roxane Andersen, a professor of Peatland Science at the University of the Highlands and Islands, in the village of Lochinver, to discuss the landscape and its recently acquired Unesco status.
Catch the train
Running from Inverness to Thurso and Wick, the Far North Line offers several stops perfect for exploring the area. Trains depart from Inverness four times a day, Monday to Saturday, and once on Sundays. Catch the first train at 07:00, explore, and hop back on the next service departing from Inverness at 10:41, 14:00, and 18:31 – or stay overnight to enjoy the Highlands at a slower pace. Apart from Forsinard and Dunrobin, ideal stops include Tain, home to the historic Glenmorangie whisky distillery just 1.5 miles from the station.
As someone who has been studying the area for more than a decade and was closely involved in securing its World Heritage status, Andersen knows the bogland through and through. It is a land of striking contrasts – hauntingly beautiful, even mysterious at times, stretching from the hills of the west coast to the gentler terrain of the east. Moreover, this vast bogland plays an indispensable ecological role.
""Like all peatlands, the Flow Country plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate because it slowly but steadily takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and stores it as dead vegetation, or peat, for millennia. In doing so, it cools the climate,"" said Andersen.
Along the Far North Line, Forsinard is the best stop to explore this unique landscape. Here, the old train station serves as Forsinard Flows Visitor Centre, open from April to October. From the train station, I stroll the 1 mile Dubh Lochan Trail along a wooden platform to the Flows Lookout Tower, which is open year-round. The platform is dotted with information posts about the landscape, from the trees that used to grow here to the workings of the bog's pool systems.
""There are places where one can actually walk for tens of kilometres in one direction without seeing another person, without crossing a road,"" said Graham Thompson, a local resident and tour guide. ""It truly is magnificent to still be able to experience this in the UK.""
Reaching the wooden two-storey lookout tower, I remember Thompson's words; indeed, there is no one around but relentless wind and an occasional gust of drizzle to keep me company.
I climb the tower and take in the view. The brown peat dotted with dark pools of water extends over the horizon. In its bleakness, the landscape has a strong impact. Here, amidst the bog and water, the creatures that thrive – insects, birds and the occasional mammal such as otters and red deer – form a delicate balance that makes this place truly one of a kind.
""It is Britain's last remaining wilderness,"" Thompson told me. And as I stand there, I can feel it.
But the Flow Country is no Paradise Lost. For centuries, it has struggled against the pressures imposed by human actions. On a riverside bench in Lochinver, I listened as Andersen explained how the area was shaped by the aftermath of the Jacobite uprising and the Highland Clearances, when this remote landscape was reshaped into vast estates dedicated primarily to sheep grazing. Once-peopled valleys and straths were emptied, with communities pushed to the coast, leaving behind the bogs and hills.
A more recent struggle dates to the 1980s, when commercial forestry introduced non-native trees and large sections of the bog were drained. While Thompson believes things are getting worse, with wind farms springing up everywhere, Andersen takes a more optimistic view, highlighting the transformation of both the landscape and the people.
""Now all these people sit around the table together and have a shared vision of what could happen in this landscape for the future. And I think that, as a society, the shift from 40 years ago to where we are today in such a short time is truly inspiring.""
I leave the viewing tower and Forsinard behind, Andersen's words of hope lingering in my mind, and hop back onto the Far North Line, continuing my journey to the small harbour town of Thurso.
As the train pushes further north, keeping away from the coast, I reflect on the sights I've seen. The Far North Line has delivered most of the typical Scottish imagery, from border collies and sheep to dramatic coastlines and wild bog landscapes. It has been a great alternative to the NC500, a popular and often over-crowded drive around the Highlands, offering a romantic way to experience the wild beauty of the region.
We pass Georgemas Junction, where the line splits towards Thurso and Wick, before finally reaching Thurso, the last train stop before the sea. Along the way, we've passed Beauly Station, home to Scotland's shortest train platform – at just 15.06m long, only one carriage door can be opened for people to exit or enter the train – and we've also passed Altnabreac, the country's most remote station; surrounded by boglands and located 10 miles from the closest road. Georgemas itself is the UK's northernmost junction. But more than these superlatives, this journey has been about slowing down and allowing the mind to wander.
Few rail journeys provide such a deep sense of solitude and reflection – a quiet, uninterrupted passage through some of Britain’s most remote landscapes, hiding multitudes of stories in its peated layers. It truly is, as Andersen put it, a ""legacy of past events"".

Peak rail fares to be scrapped by Scottish government,More expensive fares for those travelling on trains during busy times will be removed from September.,8 days ago,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x8xe2140jo,"Peak rail fares across Scotland will be scrapped from September, the first minister has announced.
John Swinney said the move would encourage more people to travel by railway, and put ""more money in people's pockets"".
A pilot scheme scrapping peak-time ScotRail fares was introduced in 2023 but ended in September following ""limited success"".
The Scottish Greens welcomed the government's U-turn on the policy and called on the first minister to do more to make public transport cheaper.
In his programme for government speech, Swinney told MSPs: ""Last year, in the face of severe budget pressures, we took the difficult decision to end the peak fares pilot on our railways.
""But now, given the work we have done to get Scotland's finances in a stronger position, and hearing also the calls from commuters, from climate activists and from the business community, I can confirm that, from 1 September this year, peak rail fares in Scotland will be scrapped for good.
""A decision that will put more money in people's pockets and mean less CO2 is pumped into our skies.""
Peak fares cover tickets bought before 09:15 on weekdays and certain services between 16:42 and 18:30.
In October 2023, ScotRail launched a pilot scheme which scrapped peak rail fares to encourage people to use the railway rather than their cars, but it ended in September 2024 following ""limited success"".
Transport Scotland said the scheme, which saw ticket prices subsidised by the Scottish government and standardised across the day, ""did not achieve its aims"" of persuading more people to swap car journeys for rail travel.
Passenger levels increased by a maximum of about 6.8% but the scheme required a 10% rise to be self-financing.
Currently, an anytime day return between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverly costs £32.60, while an off-peak ticket costs £16.60.
Swinney also announced that an alcohol ban on trains would be scrapped. He described the rules, which were introduced during the pandemic as ""counterproductive and ineffective"".
He said the ban would be replaced with ""new regulations that focus restrictions more effectively on particular times and locations"".
Concessionary travel passes used by those who take part in anti-social behaviour on public transport could be suspended, under new plans.
The first minister said work is being undertaken to develop a ""behaviour code"" which if broken could lead to the suspension or permanent ban of bus passes.
It comes after a Scottish government report found operators have reported a rise in incidents of anti-social behaviour on the bus network since the introduction of free bus passes for under 22s.
Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: ""Earlier this year, they said they wouldn't do it. They even voted against Green calls to do it. We've finally got there,"" she said.
The train drivers' union Aslef called it a ""landmark decision"", which would boost ""the appeal of rail travel over using a car.""
Aslef Scotland organiser Kevin Lindsay said: ""Ending peak-time fares removes a tax on people commuting to work, making rail travel genuinely affordable for many more people across Scotland.""
The Scottish Trade Unions Congress (STUC) also welcomed the move, calling it a victory for workers"".
The rail union, RMT said it was the ""right decision"" and a clear victory for rail workers and passengers, while the TSSA said the move was ""long overdue"".
STUC deputy general secretary Dave Moxham said: ""Peak fares were, simply put, a tax on workers that hit commuters directly in the pocket.
""We can now ensure we build an interconnected, cheaper and greener rail network that puts people before profit and puts peak fares out of commission for good.
A spokesperson for Transform Scotland, the national alliance for sustainable transport, said it was ""perverse for rail passengers to be penalised"" with peak fares, a charge that was not faced by drivers."
Swinney leads Scottish tributes following Pope's death,"Scottish religious and political leaders have paid tribute to the pontiff, who has died at the age of 88.",21 Apr 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grw94x42no,"Scottish political and religious leaders have paid tribute to Pope Francis following his death at the age of 88.
The pontiff, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, had recently been treated in hospital for pneumonia.
His death came a day after he appeared in St Peter's Square to wish happy Easter to thousands of worshippers.
First Minister John Swinney expressed his ""deep sadness"" at the Vatican's announcement.
Swinney praised the Pope for his ""principled"" leadership and expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to the Catholic community.
The first minister hailed the pontiff's ""peacefulness and his ""focus on reconciliation"".
""He was a man who was always on the side of the poor, he was always on the side of those who faced injustice,"" Swinney told BBC Scotland News.
John Keenan, bishop of the diocese of Paisley, said: ""I think everyone felt some kind of connection with Pope Francis.
""And so I think the sense of loss is not just in the church but it really is shared across the country and across the world.""
He met the Pope several times, once presenting him with a bottle of malt whisky in his office in the Vatican.
""Any time I met him he asked about the people of Scotland,"" Keenan told BBC Scotland News.
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said he was ""deeply saddened"", praising Pope Francis for dedicating his life to ""serving the poor and dispossessed"".
Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater hailed the Pope's ""commitment to securing peace for the people of Palestine and tackling the climate emergency"".
Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said it was ""heartbreaking for millions of Catholics in Scotland and across the globe"".
He posted: ""Pope Francis preached a message of inclusion and tolerance, especially for the poorest and most marginalised.""
Flags at the Scottish Parliament are being flown at half mast in tribute.
Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone expressed her ""deepest sympathy"" to the Catholic community on behalf of the parliament.
She added: ""We will remember his compassion and humanity.""
Pope Francis had been expected to visit Scotland in 2021 for COP26, the UN climate conference.
However, he was unable to attend while he recovered from colon surgery in Rome.
In 2017, the pontiff said his church enjoyed a relationship of ""true fraternity"" with the Church of Scotland.
He described the relationship between the churches as one of ""mutual understanding, trust and co-operation"".
The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Rt Rev Shaw Paterson, expressed his condolences following the Pope's death.
He said: ""May the blessed memory of Francis continue to serve as an example to the faithful people of God in our shared pilgrimage and in our common task of caring for God's creation.
""May he rest in peace.""
The primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Rev Mark Strange, praised the Pope for having ""positive dialogue"" with his church.
He added: ""His willingness to be open and approachable allowed him to get close to people, and to love and be loved by so many.""
Outside St Peter's Church in Partick, Glasgow, Margaret Miller said Francis had been a ""really good Pope"".
The churchgoer, who had just been baptised this weekend, told BBC Scotland News: ""For me, he gave me a lot of hope.
""That's what I'll remember.""
Another churchgoer Rosella Gallagher said: ""I'm so sad but he was so wonderful yesterday … so I've got lovely memories of his last day.""
Vicky Appleyard, attending lunchtime mass at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh, met Pope Francis as a 15-year-old at her communion in Buenos Aires in 1991.
She told BBC Scotland News: ""As a pope, he was extremely inclusive. I am someone from the LGBT community and he expressed so much love.""
Sciaf, the relief and development agency of the Catholic Church in Scotland, described Pope Francis as ""truly remarkable"".
Chief executive Lorraine Currie said: ""A passionate advocate for the poor and for the planet, Pope Francis has been a source of tremendous inspiration for Sciaf and our partners across the world.
""We will miss him dearly, but he will live on in our hearts and in our work."""
Turning sewage into the world's strongest material,United Utilities trials new tech at a Manchester sewage works turning sludge into graphene and fuel.,20 Apr 2025,Manchester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7x6z4gd1zo,"Technology that can turn sludge from sewage into both hydrogen fuel and the miracle material graphene is being tested in what has been described as a ""world first"" trial in Manchester.
United Utilities is working with British climate tech firm Levidian on the project at its Davyhulme sewage works in Trafford.
Under the scheme, the sludge by-product of sewage treatment is used to produce a biogas, that is then turned into graphene and hydrogen using cutting-edge technology.
Lisa Mansell from United Utilities said recovering these ""high value"" materials and fuels from the waste could help the provider ""drive down operational cost and ultimately customer bills"".
Levidian's conversion process, under way in several containers at the works, sees biogas split using microwave energy into hydrogen gas, which is then fed back into generators to help power the site.
Carbon is also generated from this process in its solid form - graphene.
Both the water company and Levidian estimate the biogas generated from sewage waste could produce up to 75,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually, enough to fuel more than 40% of all UK bus and coach journeys.
In the short-term, United Utilities plans to use the clean hydrogen and graphene to bring down its own carbon footprint.
But if successful, the technology could be used across the North West and potentially the entire country.
Graphene, a substance said to be the thinnest and strongest ever recorded, was discovered in Manchester twenty years ago, and can be used in a number of ways.
These include cutting the carbon footprint of concrete production, boosting the life of tyres, and the performance of batteries.
The works in Trafford, first built in 1894, is one of the largest in Europe, and has pioneered the improvement of the waste treatment process.
""To be stood here 110 years later to talk about turning sludge into hydrogen or graphene is really really exciting,"" said Tom Lisset, director of Bioresource & Green Energy at United Utilities.

How climate change is supercharging allergies,Seasonal allergy sufferers are being hit with more pollen over a longer season due to rising temperatures alongside extreme allergy events like thunderstorm asthma.,12 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250410-how-climate-driven-thunderstorms-supercharge-pollen-allergies,"Seasonal allergy sufferers are being hit with more pollen over a longer season due to rising temperatures, but global warming is also triggering alarming extreme allergy events, say experts.
People could see the thunderstorm, but they couldn't see what was going on inside it. Trillions of pollen particles, sucked up into the clouds as the storm formed, were now being splintered by rain, lightning and humidity into ever-smaller fragments – then cast back down to Earth for people to breathe them in.
It was around 18:00 on 21 November 2016 when the air in Melbourne, Australia, turned deadly. Emergency service phone lines lit up, people struggling to breathe began flooding into hospitals, and there was so much demand for ambulances that the vehicles were unable to reach patients stuck at home. Emergency rooms saw eight times as many people turning up with breathing problems as they would normally expect. Nearly 10 times as many people with asthma were admitted to hospital.
In total, 10 people died, including a 20-year-old law student who passed away on her lawn, waiting for an ambulance while her family tried to resuscitate her. One survivor described how he had been breathing normally and then, within 30 minutes, found himself gasping for air. ""It was insane,"" he told reporters from his hospital bed.
Paul Beggs, an environmental health scientist and professor at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, remembers the incident well. ""It was an absolutely massive event. Unprecedented. Catastrophic,"" he says. ""The people in Melbourne, the doctors and the nurses and the people in pharmacies – they all didn't know what was happening.""
It soon became clear that this was a massive case of ""thunderstorm asthma"", which occurs when certain types of storms break up pollen particles in the air, releasing proteins and showering them on unsuspecting people below. The widely dispersed proteins can trigger allergic reactions in some people – even among those who weren't previously asthmatic.
Thunderstorm asthma events like the one that hit Melbourne are one extreme example of how pollen from plants and the allergies it causes are being dramatically altered by climate change. As temperatures rise, many regions – especially the US, Europe and Australia – are seeing seasonal allergies affect an increasing proportion of people, over a longer season and with worse symptoms, say scientists.
This year, in the US, pollen levels are predicted to be higher than the historical average across 39 states this season. And that is only likely to get worse in the years to come, experts warn.
Pollen itself is an essential and ever-present part of our world. These microscopic particles pass between plants, enabling them to reproduce. While some plants spread their pollen with the help of insects, others rely on the wind, sending huge volumes of this powdery substance airborne. Many trees, grasses and weed species rely upon wind dispersal for their pollen. It is these that are especially likely to cause seasonal allergies, or hay fever.
This occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response normally reserved for pathogenic bacteria or viruses. Common symptoms can include a runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. In some cases, seasonal allergies can trigger breathing difficulties when inflammation in the airways leads to swelling, making it hard to get enough air into the lungs.
While Melbourne has been the unlucky epicentre of thunderstorm asthma, with seven thunderstorm asthma major events recorded since 1984, similar incidents have occurred around the world, from Birmingham in the UK to Atlanta in the US. Although these are still rare events, climate change may be increasing the likelihood of thunderstorm asthma incidents, in part because it is extending pollen seasons, but also because it is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, including storms.
While it isn't possible to determine exactly how much climate change influenced the 2016 thunderstorm asthma incident in Melbourne, Beggs is ""reasonably certain"" it had some impact.
""We know that climate change is leading to greater amounts of pollen in the atmosphere,"" he says. ""It's changing the seasonality of the pollen. It's changing the types of pollen that we're exposed to."" Beggs, who has researched thunderstorm asthma extensively, published a paper in 2024 that examined the links between this phenomenon and climate change.
How thunderstorms supercharge pollen
Exactly how thunderstorms trigger or exacerbate asthma in this way is still not fully understood. The leading theory is that cold air downdrafts that occur during thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds that blow at ground level, whipping up pollen grains and fungal spores from grass and plants. These then get carried high into the storm system by updrafts, where moisture in the clouds causes them to swell and break apart into smaller fragments, massively increasing the number of allergen particles in the air. The strong electric field that develops during thunderstorms may also enhance the rupture of the pollen.
This smaller particle size makes it easier for the pollen fragments to get into the airways as they are carried back to ground-level by cold down-draft winds. Pollen levels seem to spike during the first 20-30 minutes of a thunderstorm, according to studies on the phenomenon. Younger people seem to be particularly affected.
Thankfully, major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare. But climate change is increasing people's risk of pollen exposure in other ways, too.
For one thing, rising temperatures mean that pollen seasons – when plants emit pollen, typically during spring and summer – are starting earlier and lasting longer, says Elaine Fuertes, a public health scientist who focuses on the environment and allergic disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, UK. ""You're going to get people who experience symptoms earlier in the year, for a longer period of time,"" she says.
In parts of the world, including the US and Europe, one of the key culprits is ragweed – a widespread group of flowering plants that many people consider to be weeds. There are various species of ragweed around the world but they can produce mind-bending amounts of pollen. A single plant is capable of emitting one billion pollen grains, for example. Ragweed grows in gardens and farmland but also in nooks and crannies in urban environments.
Allergies to ragweed pollen already affect some 50 million people in the US alone. A study analysing data from 11 locations in North America between 1995 to 2015 found that 10 of those locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons – sometimes much longer. During that 20-year period, the season lengthened by 25 days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 days in Fargo, North Dakota and 18 days in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
""The winter warms, the springs are starting earlier, and the falls are being delayed, and so the time that you spend outdoors in contact with allergic pollen is definitely going up,"" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University, in New York, US, and one of the scientists who researched the ragweed pollen season.
These changes get more drastic in northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia, Ziska says. But also in Australia and the southern parts of South America and Africa.
Without immediate cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the effect is likely to only get worse. One 2022 study, for example, estimated that, by the end of the century, pollen seasons will begin up to 40 days earlier and end up to 15 days later than they do now – potentially meaning an additional two months of symptoms for hay fever sufferers per year.
It isn't just that people are being exposed to allergens for longer. It is also that the amount of allergens in the air are increasing in many parts of the world. In the 2000s, the pollen season in the continental US started three days earlier than it did during the 1990s, but crucially, the amount of pollen in the air was also 46% higher.
This is partly because carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere are rising, due to emissions from human activities. And many of the most bothersome plants for hay fever sufferers thrive on CO2.
When researchers grew a certain type of grass under different CO2 levels, for example, they found that plants grown in an atmosphere containing CO2 at 800 parts per million (ppm) had flowers that produced about 50% more pollen than plants grown in air containing 400ppm. The latter mimics current levels of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.
Similarly, other scientists have also experimented with growing different types of oak tree, the pollen from which often causes hay fever in countries such as South Korea. Under a 720ppm CO2 scenario, they found that each oak tree had an average pollen count 13 times what the trees had under a 400ppm scenario. Even at 560ppm, pollen production was 3.5 times higher than current levels.
More like this:
• Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies
• How light pollution disrupts plants' senses
• The science of probiotics and skin
Ziska, who authored the 2022 book Greenhouse Planet, ran similar experiments with ragweed. His results mirror those of other researchers. ""Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed plants responded. They grew more. They produced more pollen,"" he says. ""And there was some evidence that they were producing a more allergenic form of the pollen, one that could induce your immune system to respond even to a greater extent than had been in the past.""
The spread of invasive species across new parts of the world is also triggering allergic reactions in new populations of people. While originally from North America, ragweed, for example, has spread across Europe, as well as into Australia, Asia and South America. Already, some 60% of people in Hungary, 20% in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands are reportedly sensitive to the pollen from this prolific group of plants.
This makes it especially concerning that, by 2050, the concentration of ragweed pollen in the air is estimated to be about four times what it is today. Even in parts of Europe where ragweed pollen is virtually absent at present, including southern UK and Germany, ""pollen loads become substantial"" under both moderate or high-end climate scenarios, researchers wrote in a 2015 study.
About one-third of the increase is due to the continuing spread of the invasive species, the researchers note. The remaining two-thirds is specifically due to climate change, including the lengthening of the growing season as temperatures warm. ""So it'll be an earlier season, a longer season, as well as a more intense season for those who experience allergic symptoms – and then a higher risk of new sensitisation for a previously unexposed population,"" Fuertes says.
Not every region in the world will see more pollen production. Some researchers have found that southern California, for example, will experience earlier but less productive pollen seasons, largely as a result of reduced rainfall.
But these predictions don't account for all the potential effects of climate change on airborne allergens. There could also be health impacts from the increased likelihood of wildfires, for example, because this raises the risk of both asthma and allergy symptoms.
Relatively speaking, the amount of pollen in the air will still vary from year to year, Fuertes points out. But that may not be of much help to hay fever sufferers. ""Once you're sensitised and go on to develop allergic symptoms, you'll still likely experience symptoms during years when pollen levels may be lower than average,"" she says. ""You'll react to the pollen that's around.""
So, what can people do about this? Cutting carbon emissions would help to avert some of the worst climate impacts and other strategies might also mitigate the problem.
It might be possible to make some drastic but direct interventions, for example. A century ago, some US cities even set up commissions to tackle ragweed. ""Chicago employs 1,350 in hay fever fight,"" blares one headline from 1932. The news story explains that men – otherwise unemployed during the Great Depression – were paid the equivalent of one week's food and lodging (and ""25 cents in cash"") for each day they spent cutting down the plant.
While this might sound quaint, it made a difference. A 1956 study of New York City's ""Operation Ragweed"" estimated that cutting down the plant in droves cut pollen production by about 50%. Today, it is in Europe where you can find coordinated action ongoing. In Berlin, workers have been dispatched to find and eliminate ragweed around the city, while Switzerland banned the import or sale of the plant in 2024 and established volunteer groups patrolling public parks to pull it out.
Other solutions lie in smarter urban design. ""We should definitely green our cities,"" Fuertes says. ""But we do need to do it thoughtfully.""
Planting of exotic species, for example, can trigger new allergies. Opting for the male, pollen producing trees in some species over ""messy"" fruit and seed producing female ones – so-called ""botanical sexism"" – can also increase pollen levels in urban areas, although studies have shown the effect of this bias is relatively small in major cities such as New York.
It is also important to monitor and forecast pollen levels, scientists say. ""We need to know what we're breathing in. That's a pretty fundamental thing in terms of our health,"" says Beggs, who points out that while most people take it for granted that they can get reliable, real-time, validated information on metrics like temperature or rainfall in their area, relatively few can say the same for airborne allergens.
But even those services that are modelling pollen counts in an extensive, detailed way – such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute – aren't monitoring or modelling airborne allergen levels, which are more accurate as each pollen grain can release different amounts of allergens and they can vary by the weather conditions. These are a different measurement, Fuertes points out, and one that she's shown is more closely linked to allergy symptoms. ""Nobody is measuring allergen levels on a routine basis,"" Fuertes says. ""We should be moving towards that.""
Overall, experts say, the science is clear. Without concrete, coordinated action, climate change will continue to make hay fever worse across many regions of the world. This might include more dramatic, deadly events like thunderstorm asthma. But it might also mean more people sniffling and suffering, for a longer season, every year.
""We have the studies now to show that it's really having an impact on human health,"" says Beggs. ""And there's more to come.""

Plea to block wind farm over thousands of forecast bird deaths,Five conservation groups write to the first minister opposing the Berwick Bank development.,30 Apr 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj68glee30eo,"Conservation groups are urging ministers to reject plans for an offshore wind farm which the developer predicts will kill tens of thousands of seabirds.
Five charities, led by RSPB Scotland, have written to the first minister to argue that approving Berwick Bank in the Firth of Forth would undermine efforts to protect nature.
SSE says it has already amended its designs to minimise any potential risks to Scottish seabirds.
The Scottish government, which is considering whether to approve the project, says it cannot comment on live applications.
The proposed development – which would be one of the largest in the world – consists of up to 307 turbines across an area four times the size of Edinburgh.
It is positioned about 23 miles from the important seabird colonies of the St Abb's Head National Nature Reserve and the Bass Rock.
Experts say the area is an important feeding and foraging ground for seabirds.
SSE's own environmental impact assessment says it expects more than 31,000 bird collisions over the projected 35-year lifespan of the development.
The largest number expected to be killed are kittiwakes followed by gannets and herring gulls.
The letter to First Minister John Swinney calling for the application to be rejected has been signed by RSPB Scotland, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the National Trust for Scotland, the Marine Conservation Society and the Scottish Seabird Centre.
They say the potential impacts of Berwick Bank are becoming so severe that they ""overshadow and are undermining"" the progress of other, lower impact windfarm applications.
RSPB Scotland director Anne McCall says the area is one of the best places on earth for seabirds, which have been in significant decline.
""I've never seen a development with so much potential damage,"" she added:
The conservation groups argue that technology has advanced significantly since Berwick Bank was conceived and that floating wind farms, further offshore, would be a better alternative.
The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) says populations on the steep cliffs at its St Abbs reserve will be directly affected by the bird strikes on the Berwick Bank turbines.
Its ""seabird cities"" are home to guillemots, kittiwakes and razorbills.
Diarmid Hearns from the NTS says Berwick Bank could prevent further developments from going ahead.
This is because account would have to be taken of the cumulative impact of windfarm expansion when other applications are considered.
He said refusal would be ""good for the industry and good for the environment"" because it could unlock future developments further out to sea.
SSE Renewables submitted a planning application to the Scottish government in late 2022 and is still awaiting a decision.
It says it has conducted one of the largest known ornithology surveys in the world as part of the application process and that it disagrees strongly with the points put forward in the letter.
The company insists that seabird densities are ""not exceptional"" in the area and that the impact on seabirds would be among the lowest of any wind farm site. Both those claims are disputed by RSPB Scotland.
Project director Alex Meredith said: ""Berwick Bank has now been in planning for almost 30 months.
""Whilst we will always continue to work constructively with stakeholders, we must move forward urgently with action and delivery for the climate and our iconic Scottish seabirds.""
The wind farm would generate 4.1 gigawatts of electricity which is enough to power about six million homes.
The electricity would be brought to shore at Dunbar in East Lothian and Blyth in Northumberland.
The Scottish government said it would not be appropriate to comment on a live consenting application."
Five things Carney has pledged to do as Canadian PM,"The election winner wants to double Canada's home-building rate, cut some taxes and boost car-making.",2 May 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209yrq3y2po,"Mark Carney will return to the Canadian parliament with a strengthened mandate, after his Liberal Party triumphed in a snap election that he called soon after becoming prime minister.
Although one of his most pressing tasks is to deal with his US counterpart President Donald Trump - who has targeted Canada with trade tariffs and even vowed to make the country the 51st state of America - Carney has also promised action on a range of domestic issues.
In his victory speech in the early hours of Tuesday, Carney pledged to ""build, baby, build"" - an apparent nod to Trump's pledges on oil drilling.
""It's time to build twice as many homes every year with an entirely new housing industry using Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers, Canadian lumber,"" Carney told supporters.
Housing prices have skyrocketed across the country in the last decade. By doubling the rate of building, Carney hopes to have a supply of 500,000 new homes a year.
The Liberals want to create a standalone federal entity that would act as a developer for affordable housing. They plan to use this body to supply tens of billions of Canadian dollars in debt-financing for prefabricated home builders.
In his first news conference on Friday, Carney said his government ""will address failures in the housing market head on"", including by developing a modular and prefabricated housing industry.
Like people in other countries, Canadians have been grappling with higher prices for everyday goods while wages have failed to keep up - an issue over which Carney's party was criticised while under the stewardship of his predecessor Justin Trudeau.
The Liberals have proposed a slight tax cut for those in the lowest  bracket, who are due to see their rate reduce from 15% to 14%.
Carney's party has also vowed to scrap sales taxes on homes under C$1m ($720,000; £540,000) for first-time buyers.
It also wants to make dental care available to lower-income Canadians by extending a national insurance programme to 4.5 million people aged 18 to 64. The plan currently covers children, the elderly and some disabled Canadians.
The Liberals will also cap the number of temporary workers and international students allowed into the country to less than 5% of the population to the end of 2027 to ease pressure on housing and government services.
The Liberals have vowed to maintain the push on reducing emissions - as part of the fight against climate change - while ensuring Canadian companies are still competitive.
Carney has promised to build a national ""east to west"" electricity grid to reduce energy dependence on the US.
One of his first moves as PM, before the election, was to repeal Trudeau's unpopular carbon pricing programme, which was designed to give financial incentives for people and firms to turn away from fossil fuels.
But Carney maintained a similar tax on large carbon emitters.
In his victory speech, he said: ""It's time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy.""
Carney has vowed to raise defence spending to 2% of Canada's GDP, which is the target for all countries in the Nato military alliance. Last year, it spent less than 1.4%.
Trump has been critical of countries not meeting the 2% benchmark, and says Canada relies too much militarily on the US.
And Trump's pursuit of Canada as a ""51st state"" of the US has focused minds north of the border on their own security independence.
The Liberals say they will spend C$18bn on defence over the next four years, which will go to purchasing new equipment like submarines and heavy icebreakers that can be used in Canada's north.
Carney has pledged to find new ways to trade in light of the impediments placed on cross-border commerce by Trump's tariffs regime.
In his speech on Tuesday, Carney vowed new ""trade and energy corridors working in partnership with the provinces, territories, and Indigenous peoples"".
On Friday, Carney pledged to remove federal barriers to trade between provinces by 1 July.
Among his plans are an ""all-in-Canada"" network for vehicle parts, under which more manufacturing will happen domestically - meaning less reliance on imports from the US.
The Liberals also want to invest C$5bn in national ports, railways, roads and other infrastructure that would help the country further diversify its trading partners.

Taxi driver fined after offering illegal rides,"Talal Bin Mumtaz Raja operated while his licence was suspended, illegally plying for hire.",27 Apr 2025,Berkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdz574pd20o,"A taxi driver has been fined more than £1,000 and banned from driving for six months after offering illegal rides.
Talal Bin Mumtaz Raja, from Reading, Berkshire, is a South Oxfordshire licensed Private Hire and Hackney Carriage driver and operated while his licence was suspended, illegally plying for hire in Reading.
Reading Borough Council's licensing team conducted an undercover test purchase operation last year, during which Mr Raja agreed to take an officer to an address in Tilehurst for £12 without prior booking.
He was convicted of four offences on 7 April at Reading Magistrates Court.
Mr Raja is licensed as a black cab driver but this only entitles him to pick up customers without a booking in the borough where he is licensed.
It was discovered that Mr Raja's driving and vehicle licences had been suspended at the time of the test purchase because he had failed to complete mandatory disability training.
The court imposed fines of £700 for the offences of plying for hire and operating without insurance.
Mr Raja was also handed costs of £1,000, and a victim surcharge of £280, along with a six-month driving ban.
John Ennis, Reading Borough Council lead for climate strategy and transport, said he hoped that ""this and the other recent successful prosecutions serve as a deterrent to drivers who are tempted to work opportunistically and outside of the law in Reading"".

Peace negotiator urges young people to 'stay and cement the peace',"Senator Mitchell - the chairman of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement negotiations - urges young people to ""stay and cement the peace"".",16 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8240r8w84o,"The American mediator who negotiated the peace deal in Northern Ireland has called on young people to ensure political progress is not lost.
Senator George Mitchell said he was ""alarmed"" by the number of people still leaving to live elsewhere.
Speaking to an audience at Queen's University Belfast, including many teenagers and students, he encouraged them to work to cement peace.
Senator Mitchell is now aged 91 and has suffered ill health in recent years. His speech was entitled ""passing the torch"".
He said: ""Alarmingly, we have a 'brain drain' of young people leaving Northern Ireland.
""All of this has meant that a sense of fear and tribalism still remains in certain quarters. This fear and tribalism can instil rigidity, and that rigidity can create a climate of coldness and fear. And the bitter chill of that reality is that it could possibly cause an unforeseen snap.
""We simply cannot – ever – allow a return to the violence that other generations have witnessed.""
It was 27 years ago this month that Senator Mitchell chaired the Stormont talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement.
The 1998 peace deal ended the so-called Troubles during which more than 3,000 people were killed.
Addressing the 700-strong audience at Queen's, the veteran American politician made a call for action.
He said:  ""You, the young people of this island, are needed here in order to sustain this ongoing peace.
""Do not let your truths and your dreams leave when there is so much to be done at home.""
Senator Mitchell said: ""I am here today to ask you to take the job of the future seriously. Do not let us down. Listen, consider, move forward.
""I make this call to teachers, to artists, to leaders, to workers, to businesses, to non-profits, to community organisations, to civil servants, but most of all to our young people - you are the leaders and the lightning rods of tomorrow.
""I am well aware that there are other concerns that your generation, and the following generations, will encounter – not least the problems of climate change, global migration and issues of identity.
""But these issues will be easier to confront when there is peace on the ground.""
Senator Mitchell concluded: ""We pass the torch to you."""
He wanted to be Australia's PM. But a 'Trump effect' thwarted Peter Dutton,A Trump effect and a lack of a coherent campaign saw opposition leader Peter Dutton lose the election.,3 May 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgwnj8v5eo,"""It's not our night,"" Australia's opposition leader Peter Dutton told a roomful of supporters in Brisbane after his rival, Anthony Albanese, was re-elected as prime minister.
It was indeed a bruising night for Dutton, a 54-year-old political veteran who also lost his parliamentary seat of 24 years to a candidate from Albanese's Labor Party.
This is a big win for the prime minister, who made a surprising comeback to secure a comfortable majority for a second term. But it's an even bigger loss for Dutton and his Liberal National Coalition.
Dutton initially seemed to have an advantage over the incumbent PM who was battling a cost-of-living crisis and dismal ratings. But that advantage vanished as the campaign wore on, ending in a humiliating defeat.
An awkward and inconsistent campaign that did not do enough to reassure voters was partly to blame. But there is no mistaking the big part played by what some have called the ""Trump effect"".
Dutton, whether he liked it or not, was a man who many saw as Australia's Trump - but as it turns out Australians do not appear to want that.
Dutton's brand of hard-line conservatism, his support for controversial immigration policies – like sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centres – and his fierce criticism of China, all led to comparisons with US President Donald Trump.
It's a likeness he has rejected but then the Coalition pursued policies that seemed to have been borrowed from the Trump administration.
Dutton said that if elected he would cut public sector jobs - more than 40,000 by some estimates. This reminded voters of billionaire Elon Musk's Doge, or Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed US bureaucracy. Dutton later walked back the plan.
The Coalition even appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency. And images of her wearing a cap with the words Maga - short for the popular Trump slogan, Make America Great Again - have become a key talking point.
None of this served Dutton well and he knew it. Towards the end of the campaign, he tried to shake off Trump's shadow, and in the final leaders' debate he repeatedly told the audience that he didn't know Trump before attempting to answer questions on him.
""The Coalition will probably regret issuing messages that came across as supporting Trump and opposing the US Democrats,"" said Frank Mols, a political science lecturer at the University of Queensland.
""Once the stock markets started to drop in response to the uncertainty created by the [Trump's] tariffs, it became harder for the Coalition to profile itself as a safer pair of hands for the economy.""
The talk of trade wars and tariffs increased voters' worries. Speaking to people across Australia – the BBC travelled to Perth in Western Australia and Melbourne in the final week of campaigning – it was clear that global politics only became more important through the campaign.
Australia has long balanced its military alliance with the US and its economic relationship with China, its biggest trading partner.
But a US-China trade war, along with an unpredictable White House, is tricky territory for any country - even a US ally like Australia.
Could Dutton provide stability in these unusual times?
Dutton had long tried to convince voters that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with Trump. He often cited his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term.
But in the end voters weren't convinced.
Dutton's own inconsistent policies and the Trump-esque rhetoric and decisions appear to have driven away an electorate that is deeply concerned about a new, tumultuous world order.
""Our message was confusing... Labor had a tight and very disciplined campaign,"" Jitendra Prasad, a LNP supporter, told the BBC as he was about to leave the watch party on Saturday night after a disappointing outcome.
That was evident in the swings towards Labor across the country, which led to a fairly quick, emphatic result.
Towards the end of the campaign, Dutton also embraced the right-wing One Nation Party, which some Coalition members had warned was the wrong move. And it didn't seem to have helped. Rather, it may have hurt him.
""They just read the rooms incorrectly,"" says Ben Wellings, associate professor of Politics and International Relations at Monash University.
""It was one of the things that we always say about the electorate in Australia  - it's a small C conservative and maybe the radical right message was just in the end, too radical and seemed too disruptive.""
What also didn't help was that Dutton's was never a smooth campaign.
There were gaffes, such as when he accidentally hit a cameraman with a football, and costly missteps, like getting the price of a carton of eggs wrong during an election debate - his guess (A$4.20) was, in fact, half the actual price.
It was not a good look in an election where cost-of-living has been a dominant theme.
""Dutton has seemed more comfortable attacking Labor than presenting a strong alternative,"" says Jacob Broom, a lecturer in politics and policy at Murdoch University in Perth.
""I think it has been effective for Labor to point to the Liberals voting against cost-of-living measures like the tax cuts which they proposed toward the end of the term.""
While Dutton criticised Labour's tax relief measures and spending, he then announced that he would also effect tax rebates and big spends, including billions to boost defence and fix an ailing public healthcare system.
But at the same time he also promised cuts. Analysts say this inconsistency confused voters and became an unfortunate theme in his campaign.
He announced and then walked back plans for huge changes to the bureaucracy, including job cuts and the plans to end work from home arrangements. He said it was ""a mistake"".
But ""the backflips on working from home and his uncertainty over public service cuts,"" complicated his message, according to John Warhurst, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University.
The result, many believe, was the lack of a coherent campaign.
""I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,"" a member of Dutton's own party in his Dickson constituency told the BBC earlier on Saturday.
He wondered if Dutton's support for nuclear energy put people off - an issue that analysts such as Dr Mols said could have worked against him because Australian voters had not ""warmed up"" to the idea of nuclear energy.
Ultimately, the biggest issue this election - cost-of-living - may have helped Labor cement its message that theirs was the steadier hand.
Evanthia Smith, another voter in Dutton's Dickson seat, said she voted for Labor because she believed their candidate would do more to improve public education and access to healthcare.
Dutton acknowledged the huge loss the Coalition had faced: ""Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight, including in my electorate of Dickson... We'll rebuild from here.""
It was the same advice a supporter in Brisbane had for the party: ""The party needs to go back to the drawing block and look at their policies. We need to focus on the typical issues: Housing, cost-of-living - they are the biggest."""
Grande dame hangs up her ballet shoes aged 89,Some of Sheena Gough's students travelled hundreds of miles for her classes in Edinburgh.,25 Apr 2025,"Edinburgh, Fife & East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k78nvj83o,"Sheena Gough is 89 years old but she can easily lift her leg on to a ballet barre to demonstrate elegant dance moves to her class.
The ballet teacher, who trained in London and Paris, has pupils who travel hundreds of miles every week for her 90-minute lessons in Edinburgh.
But now the grande dame has decided to hang up her ballet shoes after a 72 year career.
BBC Scotland News joined her last class in the Stockbridge area of the city, where her students said it was the ""end of an era"".
Sheena enrolled at the Scottish School of Ballet in Grosvenor Crescent in Edinburgh when she was 14 years old.
By the age of 17, her talent had caught the eye of English ballet dancer and choreographer Anton Dolin - who begged her parents to let her be taught by Bolshoi-trained Olga Preobrajenska in Paris.
""Fortunately my parents agreed,"" Sheena said.
""I was really rather nervous, my parents took me over in the car and dropped me off at someone's flat in Paris and left me to get on with it.
""It wasn't even a school, she was just somebody that famous dancers from all over the world would go to to attend her classes, so it was a little bit daunting.""
Margot Fonteyn - the Royal Ballet prima ballerina -  was among Sheena's fellow pupils in the classes, which were conducted in French.
""She was sweet, I remember her having difficulty with one of the steps. It was all quite an adventure,"" Sheena said.
But it was when she moved to London that she badly injured her ankle while doing pointe work - where dancers perform on the tips of their toes - and her parents told her to travel back to Edinburgh while it healed.
There she helped with the teaching at her former ballet school during her recovery.
""And lo and behold I discovered I was far happier teaching than performing - and I've never looked back. I've been teaching ever since,"" she said.
Ian Johnston, 60, regularly makes a 200-mile round trip from Castle Douglas to join Sheena's lessons.
He first joined her class when he lived in Edinburgh in 1991. Now he brings his son, Sandy.
""I travel this distance every week because Sheena is one of a kind, her classes are inspirational and her teaching style is very exciting,"" he said.
Ian contacted the BBC through Your Voice, Your BBC News to suggest we tell Sheena's story.
""There is nobody else who teaches quite like her,"" Ian added.
""Her classes are notoriously tough and rewarding.
""It's going to be quite a shock not to have her anymore but I will hear her corrections in my head and her saying, 'Where's your face? Where's the join? Where's the excitement?' every time I do other classes in the future.""
Ian's son, Sandy, added: ""I can't tell you how much I will miss the classes, they are the best I have ever been to and unlike anything else.
""She doesn't let us away with anything, she notices everything, and she knows what you can aim for.
""I'm very sad she's retiring because you don't find many classes like these anymore.""
Sheena said she decided to retire after worrying she might not be able to remain at her peak.
But she is not planning to have a rest.
""There is the garden and my house to tidy up,"" she said.
""I think I ought to make it easier for anybody who has to sort it out after I go.""
Another pupil, data scientist Ryan Mcmanus, said it was the end of an era.
The 34-year-old, who travels more than 100 miles every week for the class, said: ""It's the highlight of my every week to come along and have a great time learning how to do things and getting corrections.
""I have been to other classes and what I like about Sheena is she is very insistent on the fundamentals: on correct placement, correct posture, on correct technique.
""I've seen a vast improvement in me and it's entirely down to her correctness, which I really appreciate coming from a scientific background myself.
""I had tears in my eyes when the class ended, I'm so sad and I sincerely doubt we will be able to find anyone like her again.""
Tracy Hawkes, a ballet dancer who owns the dance studio in St Stephen Street where Sheen's classes are held, said the teacher had left a wonderful legacy.
""She's certainly one of the grande dames in Scotland,"" she said.
""To have someone who has been through decades of change in style and methods of teaching but has continued to have been such a font of all knowledge and experience, to have someone who is nearly 90 still doing that is just amazing.
""I've been so proud to have her here at the studio and it's a very sad day now she's retiring.""
Some of Sheena's pupils have gone on to the Royal Ballet, International Ballet and the British Ballet.
""One of my former pupils is about to move to the Scottish Ballet and when he heard I was retiring he was on the phone saying he wants private lessons, I'll get you tickets to come see me dance if you just give me some private lessons,"" Sheena said.
""So, it's meant to be the end - but we'll see."""
Iraq sandstorm leaves many with breathing problems,"The sandstorm blanketed southern regions in an eerie, orange haze and shut down airports.",15 Apr 2025,Middle East,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxznxyx5do,"More than 1,000 people have been left with respiratory problems after a sandstorm swept across Iraq's central and southern parts of the country, health officials said.
One official in Muthanna province reported to the AFP news agency at least 700 cases of what they said was suffocation.
Footage shared online showed areas cloaked in a thick orange haze, with local media reporting power cuts and the suspension of flights in a number of regions.
Dust storms are common in Iraq, but some experts believe they are becoming more frequent due to climate change.
Pedestrians and police wore face masks to protect themselves from the dust and paramedics were on site to assist people with difficulty breathing, according to AFP.
Hospitals in Muthanna province in southern Iraq received at least ""700 cases of suffocation"", a local health official said.
More than 250 people were taken to hospital in Najaf province, and at least 322 patients including children were sent to hospitals in Diwaniyah province.
A further 530 people reported breathing issues in Dhi Qar and Basra provinces.
The sandstorm blanketed Iraq's southern provinces in an orange cloud that reduced visibility to less than one kilometre (0.62 mile).
The authorities were forced to shut down airports in the provinces of Najaf and Basra.
Conditions are expected to gradually improve by Tuesday morning, according to local weather services.
Iraq is listed by the UN as one of the five countries most vulnerable to climate change as it encounters regular sandstorms, sweltering heat and water scarcity.
A severe sandstorm in 2022 left one person dead and more than 5,000 needing treatment for respiratory illnesses.
Iraq will be experiencing more ""dust days"" in the future, according to its environment ministry."
Hong Kong frees four pro-democracy lawmakers who completed jail terms,They were part of the Hong Kong 47 who tried to run an unofficial election primary.,29 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y6zzg22r5o,"Hong Kong has released four former opposition lawmakers who were among dozens of pro-democracy leaders jailed under the city's controversial National Security Law (NSL).
The four -  Claudia Mo, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Gary Fan - had pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to four years and two months behind bars in November.
They were released on Tuesday because the fact they had been in prison since their arrests in 2021 was taken into account when calculating their sentence.
The four lawmakers were part of a group known as the Hong Kong 47.  They were accused of trying to overthrow the government by running an unofficial primary to pick opposition candidates for local elections.

Police said they had left their correctional facilities early on Tuesday.
This was the biggest trial under the national security law (NSL) which China imposed on the city shortly after explosive pro-democracy protests in 2019.
Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in a months-long standoff against Beijing. Triggered by a proposed government treaty that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, the protests quickly grew to reflect wider demands for democratic reform.
Beijing and Hong Kong authorities argue the law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened autonomy.
But critics have called it ""the end of Hong Kong"" and say it has created a climate of fear in the city.
The Hong Kong 47 included famous figures like Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, who were icons of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong.
Others were arrested after they stormed the city's Legislative Council (LegCo) and spray-painted Hong Kong's emblem in what became a pivotal moment in the 2019 protests.
A total of 45 people were jailed for conspiring to commit subversion. Two of the defendants were acquitted in May.
The sentences were widely condemned by the international community including the UK and the US.
Claudia Mo, known affectionately in Cantonese as Auntie Mo, is among the most well known of the group.
A prominent opposition lawmaker, the 67-year-old helped set up the now disbanded opposition Civic Party in 2006 and by 2012 she had won a seat in LegCo.
She was among 15 lawmakers who resigned en masse from LegCo after four pro-democracy lawmakers were ousted in November 2020. The move left LegCo with no opposition presence.
Kwok Ka-ki and Jeremy Tam were also former Civic Party lawmakers. Gary Fan was a co-founder of another opposition party, the Neo Democrats."
Global breakthrough to tackle shipping emissions,Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.,11 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xxv22wl9o,"Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.
The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.
The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London – but it eventually passed on Friday.
Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal ""unfit for purpose"".
Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.
But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.
The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.
It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.
Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.
The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.
Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.
There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.
The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.
""There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,"" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.
""Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,"" he said.
In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.
Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.
""There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,"" said Refke Gunnewijk, manager for clean industry & transport at the Port of Rotterdam.
Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.
""Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,"" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.
Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.
""This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach"", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.
It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.
But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.
Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.
""It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,"" he said.
Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.
""You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,"" he said.
Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a ""Net Zero"" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.
It is this ""redistribution"" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then ""reciprocal measures"" would be taken.
Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.
But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.
The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.
Now the committee have agreed the measure, it is expected to be formally adopted in October.

Fears canal running dry would 'devastate' villages,Visitors and locals say saving the water supply at Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal is crucial.,27 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87p5l8gg8po,"Residents in villages near a 19th Century canal under threat of running dry fear a lack of water supply would devastate communities.
Last month, operators warned Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal could run dry in days after limits were placed on taking water from the environmentally sensitive River Usk.
Money earmarked for repairs has since been used to buy an emergency water supply from Welsh Water by the Canal and River Trust, but businesses, visitors and boat owners said a permanent solution was needed.
One pub owner called the uncertainty ""insane"" adding they expected to lose about 50% in customer fallout if the canal ran dry.
The Welsh government said it recognised the value of the canal but any arrangement between the Canal and River Trust, and Welsh Water would be a ""commercial decision"" in which it should play no role.
More than 13,000 people have so far signed a petition to help save the canal, which is about 35 miles (56km) long and runs from the north of Newport to Brecon, through the Bannau Brycheiniog National Park, also known as the Brecon Beacons.
Under new restrictions to protect rivers due to climate change, legislation means licences were now required to limit the amount of water that could be taken from the River Usk.
But some people in communities in the surrounding areas have said limiting water supply to the canal should be a last resort.
Meghan Spence, 36, and Jak Arnott-Job, 41, run the canalside Coach and Horses pub in Llangynidr, which was founded in 1801.
Originally from South Africa, the couple moved to Brecon about a year ago and said a dry canal would be ""detrimental"" to the area as there would be ""nothing"".
""It's heritage, it's everything to people here, but not just here, it's people from overseas, outlying areas which aren't as beautiful as this, people come here to just de-stress.
""It's scary because we have only been here for a year, but we have seen the benefit it has had on the community, on those who need it,"" he said.
Mr Arnott-Job described the whole situation as mind-boggling, adding: ""People have homes and businesses all over the canal that function only with the canal and its why they come here.""
The pair said they were very grateful for the temporary measures put in place but could not understand who allowed it to happen, describing it as insane.
""There are water voles, otters, kingfishers on the canal, and the boaters live on the river,"" Mr Arnott-Job said, adding ""they live here it's their home"".
""If the canal died, 30% of our traffic would end, fallout from that would be 50% and we would just be relying on the locals, we would stay for that but it would not be the same.""
The pair said they get visitors from all over the world and the government was ""cowardly"" for not intervening.
""You talk about increasing the language of Wales, wanting people to speak it more and more, but you're destroying the ground of it,"" he added.
Concern was rife for those living on narrow boats on the canal too.
Steve and Angela Hale have lived on the canal for nearly nine years and said they wanted more clarity beyond the next 12 months.
""It's not nice being in limbo, we have lost a lot of sleep over it. You're just left in shock and feel helpless,"" said Ms Hale.
""We're here because we genuinely love the canal. There is a lot of anxiety about this.""
""Once these claybanks dry, there will be no recovery, it's irreplaceable,"" added Mr Hale.
""Instead of just funding more water supply, Welsh government could help by finding alternate solutions.""
The couple said spending would be better put towards repairing leaks along the River Usk or implementing structures to source water from alternate reservoirs.
""I think everyone just needs to work together to find a viable solution,"" they added.
Penelope Jane Phillips, who runs Penelope Cafe in Goytre Wharf, Llanover, said it was a worrying time for everyone on the Wharf, which had more than 200 years of history.
She said there was speculation of trouble with water levels in 2024 but nothing was  done.
""It's really worrying,"" said Ms Phillips.
""You always think ahead, I have to think of my business. It would be dead without water flow, it would be horrible.
""It's dreadful, who would want to look at a boat or buy a boat without flow.""
Visitors at the cafe, Patricia Webb and Debbie Harvey, from Raglan, said the matter was much bigger than a commercial one and called for Welsh government intervention.
Ms Webb said she used the canal to help her mental health, while Ms Harvey described the canal as ""heavenly"".
""It's so beautiful. And the walk is good for your health but it's the social aspect, the dogs, the school trips here, it's all lovely.""
Natalie, 49, is a waitress at the Walnut Tree cafe in Llangynidr and said she was divided as one of those who used to test the River Usk.
""They need to support the river, the river is in trouble with its biodiversity, but there has got to be limits,"" she said.
""It shouldn't be at the expense of everybody and the wildlife supported along the canal.""
The Welsh government said: ""Protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies.
""We recognise that Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water and the Canal and River Trust have successfully reached an agreement on a short-term solution to the ongoing issue, and are continuing their discussions.""
It added while the government was not involved in commercial negotiations, it ""understands the value"" of the canal and was keen to see positive progress in finding solutions.
Richard Parry, Canal and River Trust chief executive, said the pressure remained to ""urgently"" find a long-term viable solution to protect the canal.
In a statement, he called upon the Welsh government to help secure a more sustainable future, as ""it isn't sustainable for a charity to shoulder the full financial burden of this new legislative requirement""."
Bottlenose dolphins spotted killing dolphin juvenile,"Rare attack seen by dolphin spotting tour could become more common as the seas warm, an expert says.",18 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdz2ny9dqzo,"A common dolphin juvenile has been killed by four bottlenose dolphins in an attack that could become more common as the oceans warm, a cetacean expert has warned.
People on a dolphin spotting trip from New Quay, Ceredigion, were left ""hysterical"" by the incident on Thursday at 18:10 BST in Cardigan Bay, where the juvenile was thrown out of the water.
Climate change means common dolphin numbers are increasing in the area, where resident bottlenose dolphins will hunt them as a form of ""play"", said Matthew Westfield from the  UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP).
It recovered the juvenile - estimated to be two years old - to perform an autopsy.
""Across the UK we are seeing more  attacks where a bottlenose dolphin attacks a common dolphin juvenile,"" he said.
A boat owned by Dolphin Spotting Boat Trips and carrying 12 passengers spotted what they initially thought was a porpicide - the name given to the deliberate killing of a harbour porpoise by bottlenose dolphins
The group included Ghost, a favourite with dolphin spotters.
""Ghost and another dolphin she was with all of a sudden started speeding towards this larger group of dolphins,"" said passenger Holly Williams, 35.
""They started jumping out the water and we thought they were just playing.""
They saw something being flung out of the water by the dolphins and initially thought it was a salmon.
""My daughter was hysterical,"" said Ms Williams.
""She loves animals and is very sensitive.""
The company's photographer Sarah Michelle Wyre, 30, said: ""It was an incredibly rare encounter where a pod of bottlenose dolphin attacked and killed a common dolphin calf.
""I've never seen that behaviour before. It's very common for bottlenose dolphins to attack porpoise bit not a common dolphin calf.""
Dylan Coundley-Hughes, 22, is a researcher for the SeaWatch Foundation caught the attack on camera.
""These kind of attacks are so rare to see in person. We know they happen in the wild but it's rare they're ever seen,"" he said.
Mr Westfield said the increasing number of common dolphins in the area mean more interactions with the resident population of about 250 bottle nose dolphins.
""Its not that clear why they do it,"" he said.
The food the two types of dolphins eat only ""slightly"" overlap, he explained.
""The bottlenose is probably the most intelligent cetacean we see on the Welsh coast.
""They are an apex predator with a huge intelligence and a lot of free time because they are so good at hunting.""
He said the attacks are probably down to ""something as simple as play"".
They are also brutal he said, adding: ""The calf was most likely with its family pod when the bottlenose dolphins separated it off."""
Millions watch as Swedish elk begin annual migration,Millions of people have tuned in to watch moose on the move in northern Sweden over the past six years.,16 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewgn0v5j9po,"Every spring for the past six years, millions of people have tuned in to a round-the-clock livestream of elk on the move in northern Sweden.
""The Great Moose Migration"" tracks the animals as they swim across the Angerman River and make their annual journey toward greener, summer pastures.
This year's 24-hour programme from SVT Play, the streaming platform for Sweden's national broadcaster, began on Tuesday - a week ahead of schedule because of the warmer weather this April.
The broadcast has become a ""slow TV"" phenomenon, cultivating a loyal fanbase since its inception in 2019.
Cait Borjesson, 60, who has been hooked to the annual livestream since she stumbled upon it during the Covid-19 pandemic, said her TV had been on for 16 straight hours since it began on Tuesday.
""It's unbelievably relaxing,"" she said. ""There's the natural sounds of the birds, the wind, the trees. It gives you a sense that you're in nature even if you're not"".
For Cait, watching the migration has become a yearly tradition, so much so that she books time off work to fully immerse herself in the three-week broadcast.
She said the stream was ""like therapy"" which had helped her anxiety and panic attacks.
And she is not alone. SVT's livestream has a wide audience, including a Facebook group boasting more than 77,000 members who come together to share their memorable moments, emotional reactions to the broadcast and their shared fascination of the migration.
A major part of their journey captured by SVT is through the village of Kullberg in northern Sweden, next to the Angerman. The animals are known as moose in North America, and elk in Europe.
Goran Ericsson, dean of the faculty of forest sciences at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and science advisor for the broadcast, said the elk migrate back to the summer ranges after aggregating in spots with better temperatures in the winter.
""Historically, this migration has been going on since the ice age,"" he said. ""During spring and summer, moose are more evenly spread out in the landscape.""
He added that around 95% of the elk in northern Sweden migrate annually, adding that early migrations were not new with this year's prompted by less snow on the ground.
""Early springs happen occasionally,"" he said. ""We're still within the normal range of variation.""
More than 30 cameras are used to capture the elk as they move through the vast landscapes, he added.
The show drew in nearly a million people during its launch in 2019, before garnering nine million viewers in 2024.
Minh-Xuan Truong, a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences who has surveyed viewers of the livestream, said in a fast-paced media environment, people enjoy experiencing nature through this ""slow TV"" style - a genre characterised by long, un-edited and real-time broadcasts.
""A lot of people say it's like an open window to a forest,"" he says. ""When you ask them if they would prefer having music in the background, or commentary, they say they prefer just having the sound of the wind, the birds and trees.""
Sweden's woodlands are home to about 300,000 elk. The animal is known in the Scandinavian country as ""King of the Forest"".

Rainforest garden to be created at Bristol Zoo,A rainforest garden due to shown at RHS Chelsea Flower Show will be moved to Bristol Zoo.,5 May 2025,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l034y1zyno,"A rainforest garden due to be displayed at RHS Chelsea Flower Show later this month is going to be housed at the Bristol Zoo Project.
The Wildlife Trusts' British Rainforest Garden is going to be used as an educational space within the zoo after it has been shown at Chelsea.
It is due to open in October and feature boulders and fern-lined trails, with a canopy of native trees created from hazels, field maples and silver birch from the show garden.
Garden designer Zoe Claymore said: ""The chance to educate the next generation of conservationist and gardeners is truly a huge honour.""
The garden can be seen at site number 340 throughout Chelsea week from Tuesday 20 May to Saturday 24 May.
It will then be recreated and reimagined in Bristol to inspire a link back to historic rainforests and teach younger generations.
The garden will feature boulders, lush undergrowth, lichen-encrusted trusts, honeysuckle and ivy to bring the rainforest environment to life.
Justin Morris, chief executive of Bristol Zoological Society, said: ""We are extremely excited about the arrival of the British Rainforest Garden later this year.
""It will fit perfectly into our Sanctuary Garden.
""This area will form the beginning of a new gardens biome at Bristol Zoo Project.""
He added visitors would be encouraged to pause and reflect on the value of gardens and how they could take action to protect wildlife.
Kathryn Brown, director of climate change and evidence at The Wildlife Trust, said: ""How magical to rehome this little rainforest garden in a place already loved by generations of families.""
The garden has been designed to be low carbon, with no concrete, clay, peat compost or virgin wood used in the design and all the plants are from UK nurseries using peat-free compost.
The British Rainforest Garden was funded by grant-making charity Project Giving Back and supported by Aviva.

"England water pollution at 10-year high, campaigners say",Campaigners release official data showing the most serious pollution incidents in England are double the target.,16 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rp6e75q4o,"The number of pollution incidents recorded by water companies in England is at a ten-year high, according to data obtained by campaigners.
Surfers Against Sewage said the Environment Agency data showed the number of incidents was more than double its target.
Such spills have the potential to cause damage to wildlife and illness for people making use of the country's rivers and seas.
Water UK, the industry body representing UK water and sewage companies, said companies plan to invest £12bn to reduce spills by the end of the decade.
As well as reporting the total number of sewage spills annually, environmental regulator the Environment Agency also records the number of pollution incidents, which are likely to cause serious harm to wildlife and people.
Eight years ago, the EA remarked that the water sector was not doing enough to reduce these incidents. It said this was causing ""distress to local communities and blighting rivers and beaches.""
The industry was set a target to reduce these incidents by 40% by 2025 against 2016 levels.
The latest publicly availably data is to the end of 2023. But following a Freedom of Information request, Surfers Against Sewage obtained the data up to the start of 2025.
This showed that 2,487 pollution incidents were recorded last year - a 31% increase on the 2016 levels, and almost double the original EA target.
""The water industry fails, fails and fails again,"" said Giles Bristow, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage.
He called for a reform of the system so that it ""prioritises public health and value for customer money and delivers healthy coastlines, rivers and lakes.""
Water UK responded to the findings on behalf of the nine companies responsible for handling sewage in England.
""We have been clear that the water system is not working and support the Independent Water Commission looking at every aspect of how the industry is regulated.
""However, no sewage spill is ever acceptable and water companies are investing £12 billion to almost halve spills from storm overflows by 2030,"" Water UK said.
Most of the money for that investment is expected to come from increases to water bills, which started to take effect this month.
The industry regulator Ofwat is allowing water companies to raise bills by an average of £31 each year over the next five years - but those rises don't include inflation, which means actual bills are likely to be higher.
The Water Commission is an independent review, set up by the government, to look at different ways of regulating the industry following increased public anger over water company performance.
Chairman Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, is inviting submissions from the public until next week."
Science forest added to Latitude Festival line-up,Latitude Festival is one of the biggest festivals in the UK and takes place in Suffolk.,28 Apr 2025,Suffolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjnwldvjn7o,"One of the UK's biggest music and art festivals has announced it will have a science-focused arena during the four-day event.
The Latitude Festival is expected to welcome more than 40,000 people to Henham Park, near Southwold in Suffolk, between 24 and 27 July.
The new science area is called The Cosmic Shambles Forest of Science and Culture and has been curated by The Cosmic Shambles Network, which was founded by Robin Ince and Trent Burton.
Inside the forest there will be a science festival infused with a book club, comedy club, music and interactive museum.
Organisers say the new arena will mark the first time something like this has been hosted at Latitude in the past 19 years.
Melvin Benn, founder and director of Latitude Festival, said: ""The addition of the Cosmic Shambles Forest to this year's Latitude Festival is a genuine thrill.
""There's nowhere else that brings together oceanographers, comedians, astrophysicists, musicians, poets, and puppet dogs in quite the same way. This is something truly special for 2025.""
Burton, the Cosmic Shambles Network producer and co-founder, said: ""We're going to bring our unique Shambles flavour to the forest over the whole weekend.""
Helen Czerski is a physicist, oceanographer, author and a fan of the network.
She said: ""The audience at Latitude love new ideas, and are definitely up for satisfying their curiosity alongside getting their fill of music and sun.""
The science forest is set to explore a wide-range of topics such as climate science, horror cinema, particle physics, literature, neurodiversity, space exploration, mental health, and maggots.
Musical headliners for the festival have previously been announced as Sting, Fatboy Slim and Snow Patrol.

Surrey experts help protect vital water supplies,A university produces online resources to protect and maintain unregulated water supplies.,24 Apr 2025,Surrey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39jwdezxmyo,"Experts at the University of Surrey are collaborating with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to make sure communities around the world have safe drinking water.
Billions rely on what are known as small drinking water systems, which are unregulated or maintained by major utility companies, and are vulnerable to contamination and broken infrastructure.
The Guildford-based university team has devised online resources which can be used to maintain such supplies, spotting problems before they happen.
The resources, which include a template for risk assessments and guidelines for maintaining them, have already been downloaded more than 60,000 times.
The team estimates almost 40% of the global population relies on small drinking water systems.
Dr Katherine Pond, the university's associate professor in environmental engineering, said: ""Surveillance is key to detecting and responding to potential issues before they become problems.
""As climate change increases the risk to supplies globally it's vital that we empower local communities and public health officials with the necessary knowledge to protect their water.""
The University of Surrey is due to host the WHO meeting of Collaborating Centres on Water in 2026.

Recycling points for coffee pods opened in city,"Bristol Waste sets up points at recycling centres in St Philip's, Hartcliffe Way and Avonmouth.",6 days ago,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9jmgnp5ro,"New coffee pod recycling sites have been opened at three city reuse hubs.
Bristol Waste has set up Podback points at recycling centres in St Philip's, Hartcliffe Way and Avonmouth.
Residents will be able to use any bag or container to keep their aluminium and plastic pods separate and can purchase a special container to put them in.
Bristol City Council said the scheme adds to the city's reputation of ""doing what's right for the planet"".
""This is yet another product that people here can recycle, helping the planet and the city,"" the council spokesman said.
""Bristol has a reputation of doing what's right for the planet.
""We've held the top spot for recycling rates amongst English core cities for eight years in a row.""
The pods will be shredded and the coffee grounds turned into renewable energy and soil improver.
The plastic pods will then be recycled in East Yorkshire and the aluminium pods will be recycled in Cheshire.
Podback, the company behind the project, said the scheme creates a solution to waste.
Sarah Burns, sustainability and engagement manager for Bristol Waste, said it will help to get ""as much as possible out of the city's black general waste wheelie bins"".
""We want recycling to be the norm,"" she said.
""Anything people can't reduce or reuse, we want it to be as easy and possible for them to recycle.""
Podback has said the introduction of ""drop-off containers"" at the recycling centres will offer a ""more accessible solution for a wider range of residents"".
Company executive director Rick Hindley said he hopes the project ""inspires"" other cities to ""make improvements to their recycling infrastructure"".
""Bristol is a city committed to sustainability, and this collaboration will empower residents to easily recycle their drinks pods, saving them from going to waste and ensuring valuable materials can be recycled and given a new life.""

Carbon net zero hotel 'better than original dream',"The Devon site has many sustainable features, including bedside lights made from recycled plastic.",24 Apr 2025,Devon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx26379qnnlo,"A new hotel in Devon is claiming to be one the most environmentally-friendly new-build constructions in Europe.
The Voco Zeal Hotel, at Exeter's Science Park, which opened in March, has claimed to be the first carbon net zero hotel in western Europe.
Bosses said it had many sustainable features, including bedside lights made from 3D-printed recycled plastic.
They added that they hoped the building's eco-friendly philosophy would generate future building ideas to match its energy-efficient performance.
Founder Tim Wheeldon said: ""What we've done is we've actually adopted a heating system called an adiabatic system [a process where no heat enters or leaves a system, but can be generated through compression] and you can see the pipework for some of the some of the adiabatic works that have been going on.
""It basically takes fresh air, heats it up or cools it down to a certain temperature and then distributes that within the hotel.
""I feel very proud - what we've achieved is better than I originally anticipated anyway.
""So as far as I'm concerned, I'm absolutely thrilled with what we managed to achieve.
""It was a dream of mine 10 to 12 years ago and we have actually managed to make what was deemed the impossible five years ago, actually possible.""
Steve Goodhew, Professor of Environmental Building at Plymouth University, said it was ""certainly a step forward"".
He said: ""This has got certain elements to it which means that it will be performing better than many of the other hotels in and around Exeter and, for the majority of the instances, the whole of the UK.""

Sea defence scheme to cost £4.5m more than planned,"In a meeting later, Brighton council cabinet members will be asked to increase funding to £11m.",24 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg213q20vko,"Councillors are being asked to approve an extra £4.5m for an ongoing sea defence project due to rising costs.
Brighton & Hove City Council initially set aside £6.5m to rebuild sea defences at Southwick beach, and to build new groynes and replenish shingle on the beach between the King Alfred leisure centre and Second Avenue.
In a meeting later, cabinet members will be asked to increase funding to £11m due to ""rising global costs and availability of materials and resources"".
Councillor Trevor Muten, cabinet member for transport and public realm, said the scheme was ""vital for the city to safeguard homes and businesses from coastal flooding and protect our local economy for decades to come"".
Work has already been done to build a protective layer of rock next to Basin Road South and a new sea wall near the Hove Deep Sea Anglers Club as part of the wider Brighton Marina to River Adur defence project.
The phase of work from the King Alfred will begin in September and is set for completion by May next year.
Work at Southwick will start next year and finish by April 2027.
Mr Muten said: ""By taking action now, we will help make our city more climate resilient and able to adapt to increasing storms, extreme rainfall and rising sea levels.""
He went on to say that although additional £4.5m was ""a substantial sum"", it would help to support the area's tourism industry, which he said was worth £5bn.
""We are a seafront destination, with important business hubs and transport links based around Shoreham Port and the A259 coast road,"" he said.
""It is also densely-populated, so this is an investment to protect our city, our residents and local businesses from flooding for the long term.""

The enthusiast searching for stunning sea slugs,"Eleanor Goodman says she loves them all, from the rainbow sea slug to the Disco Doris.",4 May 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1dk3km25o,"""Sea slugs are like normal slugs you find in your garden but jazzed up,"" Eleanor Goodman says.
Ms Goodman, a Devon Wildlife Trust volunteer based at Wembury Marine Centre, said she was passionate about sea slugs because they are ""one of the most colourful rock pool species you will find"".
She said there were more than 100 species of the creatures, also called nudibranch, and they were a lot smaller than terrestrial slugs.
The intertidal enthusiast spends much of her time trying to find them on the shoreline and says they are ""absolutely stunning"".
Ms Goodman, whose day job is a marine officer for Natural England, said the invertebrates can be found anywhere on rocky shores and down to the subtidal zones.
Many of them line along the south coast because the waters are a ""little bit milder"" and tended to be relatively sheltered, she said.
""Sea slugs love gullies, kelp forests and seaweed and they have a wide range of habitats.""
The 27-year old said people had to be ""lucky"" to see the colourful species because the smaller ones are only a couple of millimetres and the larger ones measure a couple of centimetres.
""What I normally do is get right down, nose to the water and bottom in the air,"" she said.
""If you have got a good pair of eyes and patience, anyone will be able to see them.""
Ms Goodman said she was passionate about all marine life, but there was something special about sea slugs.
""There is something really lovely in slowing down, being patient and getting your eye in and looking very closely at rock pools.
""I didn't even know sea slugs were a thing when I first started rock pooling, I thought it was just crabs and starfish.
""They are absolutely stunning- I just love them.""
In 2022 a rainbow sea slug was discovered in the Isles of Scilly which was neon purple, pink and yellow.
She said there was also another species named the Disco Doris which looks like ""70s wallpaper"".
""It's like a slug going to a rave,"" she said.
""They are just so gorgeous, they come in a wide range of colours and definitely one of the most colourful rock pool species you will find.""
Ms Goodman said most of them had highly specialised diets.
She said: ""Mostly feed on anemones, seaweeds and marine algae, hydroids and bryozoans, and other sea slugs and sea slug eggs.""
It is her mission to find as many species of sea slugs as possible and anyone who finds one should record them on iNaturalist to add data to the biodiversity network.
""Some sea slugs are climate change indicators,"" Ms Goodman added.
""Some come from the Mediterranean and they are migrating northwards, expanding their ranges so it is nice to paint a picture of how the seas might be warming and how that might change our waters.""

The world's first deep sea mining test 50 years on,"Half a century after the world's first deep sea mining tests picked nodules from the seafloor off the US east coast, the damage has barely begun to heal.",3 days ago,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site,"President Donald Trump is trying to fast track new deep sea mining efforts, but half a century after the world's first deep sea mining tests picked mineral-rich nodules from the seafloor off the US east coast, the damage has barely begun to heal.
Plunging to the ocean's abyss on the Blake Plateau, a deep-sea mountain range off the coast of North Carolina, is an otherworldly experience. It's like no other ocean bed that microbiologist Samantha Joye has ever visited. In her deep-sea submersible called Alvin – a three-person vessel made of titanium thick enough to withstand pressure in the ocean's depths, with two robotic arms reaching outside for sample collection – it takes more than an hour to descend to about 2,000m (6,600ft) below the water's surface.
On the way down, the water is on fire with bioluminescence and abounds with wildlife. There are huge fish, small fish and jellyfish. Shrimp, sea slugs, octopuses and hundreds of squid bump into the submarine, seeming to be curious about its free fall into their home.
""I have worked all over the place, and my mind was blown on the Blake Plateau. I mean, it's just spectacularly diverse,"" says Joye, recalling her last trip to the plateau in August 2018. At touchdown, the silty floor is covered in worms, sponges, stars and mussels the size of an adult human's forearm, says Joye, gesturing to her own limb to show me.
Among the abundance of life, though, a section of the Blake Plateau is barren with the scars from the world's first deep-sea mining pilot test carried out in 1970. That experiment 50 years ago was just a proof-of-concept, but full-scale commercial deep-sea mining is on many of today's national to-do lists. In April 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to fast-track deep-sea mining.
The traces of those first rudimentary tests on the Blake Plateau are still visible today, half a century on, and scientists think they're just a small example of the effects deep-sea mining could have on the ocean ecosystem if it were to be conducted at scale.
The world's first deep-sea mining test was conducted by US company Deepsea Ventures in July 1970. A vacuum-cleaner-like machine bulldozed through the abyss and sucked up 60,000 baseball-sized lumps off the bottom of the ocean. The nodules – filled with manganese, nickel and cobalt that accumulate a few millimetres per million years – were hoped to become a resource for the nation's industrial endeavours. There remains high interest in them today, as they're replete with minerals for making batteries for electric cars and smartphones, as well as medical and military technology.
Deepsea Ventures' project fell through, and no more deep-sea mining was done off the US East Coast. But a remote-controlled robot sent to that segment of the Blake Plateau during a 2022 scientific expedition found the company's footprints. Scientists snapped pictures of defined dredge lines in the mud for more than 43km (27 miles). The lines dug into the abyss like train tracks, as if somebody had raked through it just recently, and the damage was ""widespread and definable"", according to reports. Where the tracks are, there is nothing: no nodules and no biodiversity. No curious squid. Nothing like the kaleidoscope of beauty Joye encountered in 2018, just around the corner.
While no data is available on what that part of the Blake Plateau looked like before the deep-sea mining experiments in the 1970s, the contrast between the desolate scraped mud tracks and the rest of the Blake Plateau is stark. (You can see these tracks in the image at the top of this article.) The site is a proxy for what might happen elsewhere, says Joye.
Before and after data from a mining simulation in an analogous area in the Pacific Ocean, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, south-east of Hawaii and poised to be a deep-sea mining hotspot, suggests these ecosystems take hundreds of years to bounce back. Segments there that had been test-ploughed through in 1989 had much lower diversity of large animals, especially filter feeders, and still had up to just half of their microbial communities after 26 years.
""And if you were thinking about something that was going to recover pretty quickly, it would be microbes, right?"" says Joye. ""And that was essentially a controlled experiment supposed to do minimal damage."" Research from March 2025 confirmed the findings, noting that despite some recent recolonisation of the area, the impacts likely last for decades.
The Metals Company and Impossible Metals, two players currently active in the field, say their machines are now much more sophisticated, sustainable and less invasive than those from the pilot test half a decade ago. Impossible Metals, for instance, aims to pick up nodules one by one, ""delicately"", their reports say, without raking the seabed. Impossible Metals has already placed a request for a lease for exploration and mining off the coast of American Samoa.
""All mining has impacts. We have invented new technology to minimise the impacts,"" says Impossible Metals chief executive Oliver Gunasekara. He notes mining today is carried out in some of the world's most biodiverse areas, like the Indonesian rainforest, which is mined for nickel. As part of any mining permit approval, an environmental impact assessment would be performed to understand the impacts and ""make sure they are acceptable"", says Gunasekara.
Yet, researchers already think there are dozens of possible effects on the seabed. And precisely forecasting the impacts of deep-sea mining is difficult because so little is known about these sprawling underwater ecosystems – with more than 70% of the world's waters still unmapped, says Christopher Robbins, associate director of Ocean Conservancy. In 2023, researchers suggested that about 90% of species in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, are new to science: they found more than 5,000 deep-sea creatures they'd never seen before.
In 2024, scientists discovered the world's largest deep-sea coral reef on the Blake Plateau: more than 83,000 individual coral mound peaks spanning 500km (310 miles) in length and 100km in width (60 miles), all the way from the coast of South Carolina to the tip of Florida. The researchers from the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) who discovered the coral reefs told the BBC they were not available to discuss the work at this time.
Since more than 20 different pharmaceuticals have been developed thanks to organisms discovered in the deep sea, many undiscovered concoctions could be lost to deep-sea mining before even being discovered.
Plus, the abyssal plain is not the only ecosystem at risk, says Robbins. The mining machines trawling through the ocean bed release waves of sediment from the ground, and discharge mining wastewater from the vessels on the surface, cycling abyssal debris in plumes that can travel large distances into the water column. Research shows the plumes could mess with the lifestyle, reproduction and feeding of organisms living in these areas. Studies suggest they can stress out jellyfish's mucus production and make it hard for organisms to communicate via bioluminescence, or clog fish's airways and end up in their diet.
It’s unclear what impact this will have on the ocean's ability to capture carbon, Robbins says. Species living in the dark zone above the abyss but below the surface are responsible for drawing down upwards of six gigatons of carbon, which is about 14% of the carbon that humans emit into the atmosphere each year, says Robbins. (The vacuuming vehicles could also be releasing more than 172 tonnes of carbon directly from the seabed every year for every square kilometre mined, according to Planet Tracker.)
Aside from the wildlife impact, deep-sea mining in US waters can have some substantial impacts on the fishing industry, according to Robbins's recent report on potential conflicts in both oceans. ""There are just too many unanswered questions that require us to take a step back to allow the fishing industry, frankly, to be better informed about the trade-offs,"" says Robbins.
Off the US West Coast, another study from 2023 suggested that the migration routes of bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna could overlap with potential sediment plumes if commercial mining were to be unrolled. Other research has suggested that small developing countries catch as much as 10% of their tuna from areas likely affected by deep-sea mining.

• Saving the world's most expensive fish
• Tracking turtles during the 'lost years'
The Blake Plateau, still scarred from the 1970 mining experiment, is likely not a target for deep sea mining yet, says Gorka Sancho, a fish ecology expert at College of Charleston, who penned a petition letter to President Joe Biden in 2024 calling for robust long-term protections of the Blake Plateau. In 2020, Trump issued a moratorium banning drilling and mining in waters off the US south-east coast until 2032. ""But everything can change on a dime these days,"" says Sancho.
The Clarion-Clipperton Zone, on the other hand, is where miners have set their targets. Studies suggest this area alone contains more nickel, cobalt and manganese than all of the deposits on land.
In April 2025 Trump signed an executive order to fast-track deep-sea mining called Unleashing America's Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources. Some days later, the government received a request for license to explore and to mine from the Canadian firm The Metals Company, including areas outside the US's jurisdiction. If the US granted such a permit, this could be in conflict with the international framework governing international waters and the seabed, known as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), according to the ISA's secretary-general Leticia Reis de Carvalho. (It's worth noting, however, that the US has never ratified Unclos.) The BBC contacted The Metals Company for comment but received no response by the time of publication.
Trump's order commits Noaa to expedite mining permits. Robbins comments that the executive order is at odds with Noaa's mission. Noaa told the BBC that the agency reviews applications for compliance and requirements in accordance with the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act and regulations for exploration licenses. ""The process ensures a thorough environmental impact review, interagency consultations and opportunity for public comment,"" Noaa states.
The agency added: ""Noaa is committed to an efficient review of applications for exploration licenses and commercial recovery permits in accordance with the statutory requirements governing US seabed mining in areas beyond national jurisdiction and is actively exploring ways to streamline the application process by waiving obsolete requirements, enhancing coordination across agencies and engaging with international and private partners to ensure a transparent, and science-based licensing and permitting framework.""
At a congressional hearing about the new legislation, MIT mechanical engineering professor Thomas Peacock stated that some of the impacts of nodule mining ""may not be as speculated"". His work in 2022, carried out in part on behalf of The Metals Company, showed that only 2-8% of the murky plumes reach 2m (6.5ft) above the seabed and do not settle for hours, but that is just a few milligrams of sediment per litre and ""roughly the equivalent of a grain of sand in a fishbowl"". Still, Peacock suggested we need further advances in sensor technologies and computational modelling to craft reliable predictions of the impacts of commercial-scale ocean floor exploitation. He also suggested that large off-limit areas will have to be instituted to protect wildlife.
Many nations around the world have called for a moratorium on seabed mining until the risks are fully assessed, the science is clear, and the regulation is in place. More than 900 scientists and policy experts have also signed a letter asking for a delay in commercial activity.
In the meantime, the scars from the US's first foray into deep-sea mining testing are still there on the ocean floor, half a century on. They remain still in time, etched into the abyss, at the bottom of a world swirling with life.
""I see this place as a national treasure. What makes this place so special?"" says Joye, reminiscing on her last dive down at the Blake Plateau. ""That mystery is something that we need to solve, so that we can serve as stewards of these habitats.""

Wildlife trust considers beaver rewilding project,Surrey Wildlife Trust says reintroducing beavers into the county would help to improve wetlands.,22 Apr 2025,Surrey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jx8dx27k5o,"A wildlife trust is seeking donations as it looks to use beavers to transform habitats in Surrey.
Surrey Wildlife Trust is considering a licence to release beavers into the county after they were hunted to extinction about 400 years ago.
The trust said that releasing beavers into the wild would help to create ponds, ditches and marshes, which would in turn alleviate flood risks and help native plants and animals.
Adam Bolton, Surrey Wildlife Trust conservation manager, said: ""We're asking people to help us put nature's top engineers back at the heart of our landscapes, to help shape them for the better.""
He added: ""Given the essential services that nature provides, from flood prevention to carbon sequestration to better health and wellbeing, that would be something for everyone to celebrate.""
Other benefits from reintroducing beavers into the wild include creating ""carbon sinks"" in wetlands, which reduce the impact of climate change, and preventing wildfires.
As well as beavers, the wildlife trust is looking at reintroducing other species including large marshland grasshoppers and red deer to Surrey.
Donations to the trust would support a feasibility study into the reintroduction of beavers and an assessment of other habitat engineering options.
From Tuesday until 29 April donations will be match-funded up to £50,000 by the Green Match Fund, the trust added.
The trust claimed that eight beavers in Czech Republic had saved taxpayers about €1 million by flooding a former army training site where a long-delayed dam was planned.

"Set out priorities, county's Lib Dems tell Reform",Reform is the largest block in Warwickshire where no party has taken overall control.,3 May 2025,Coventry & Warwickshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z3dr0yg3o,"All parties on Warwickshire County Council would need to set out their priorities after none took overall control of the authority in Thursday's election, the local Liberal Democrats have said.
The group forms the second largest block on the council, with member Jerry Roodhouse, who held his seat, saying he did not have ""a clue"" about the priorities of Reform - now the authority's largest party, with 23 councillors.
The vote saw former Tory leader Izzi Seccombe lose her seat to the Liberal Democrats who secured 14.
Since Reform's success, mirrored and bettered in other parts of England, party leader Nigel Farage has alluded generally to possible approaches.
He has spoken out against backing for some green technologies and diversity schemes, and while supporting values of ""family, community and country"", has opposed ""woke"" values, and urged an end to excessive council expenditure.
With control yet to be decided between the players, Roodhouse said there had been no talk yet of any coalition deals, adding: ""We'll have to wait and see how it goes.""
Nigel Clarke, the chairman of the Warwick and Leamington branch of Reform, has said his party is happy to work with the Conservatives at a local level and meetings are already planned.
The Conservative group has nine seats, the Green Party seven, Labour three and Whitnash Residents Association one. The council previously had a strong Conservative majority, with the party holding 41 of 57 seats.
Roodhouse said: ""I would be really interested to see, apart from the national priorities they've spoken about in Reform - about climate change and all these other equality and diversity things they want to get rid of - exactly what they want to try and change and what their priorities are for Warwickshire.
""I haven't got a clue.""
He said: ""The political parties need to lay out quite clearly locally what priorities they've got, so  residents can get a clear view.""
The Liberal Democrat said he was ""not overly-happy"" about the prospect of a Reform-led council.
However, he stated: ""At the end of the day, we have a democratic system that operates. They are the biggest party.""
He said: ""It is now clearly a different landscape.""

Woodland classroom could be built at reservoir,A road closure is in place leading up to the reservoir as roadworks begin to improve flood defences.,29 Apr 2025,Somerset,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7q9en9xyo,"A woodland classroom could be built at a popular nature reserve as part of plans to upgrade facilities at the beauty spot.
Volunteers at Chard Reservoir, owned by Somerset Council, are now calling on the community to help fundraise for the works.
Residents will be able to view proposals at a meeting at the Boden Centre, Boden Street, on 21 May from 18:00 BST to 20:00.
Roadworks are also taking place along Chaffcombe Lane, the main route between the reservoir and Chard town centre, until July 11. The route has been closed to allow for improvements to the reservoir's dam, with the aim of reducing the risk of flooding.
The site currently has limited amenities for visitors, with only one compost toilet located on the opposite side of the reservoir to the children's play area and outdoor education zone.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Chard Reservoir Volunteer Group said the lack of facilities has made it difficult to host school and community groups for extended visits, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Councillor Graham Oakes,  the council's lead for public health, environment and climate change, said: ""The new mobile classroom will provide additional opportunities for children to engage with the natural environment and supports wider efforts to promote sustainability across Somerset.""

During Chaffcombe Lane's closure, the anglers car park will only be accessible to club members via Chaffcombe site access.
Other visitors will need to use the Oaklands car park at the bottom of Oaklands Avenue. Pedestrian routes via the Stop Line Way and from Oaklands car park across Touches Lane will remain open.

"Opportunity for big US-China trade deal, says Bessent",The comments from the US Treasury Secretary come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated.,23 Apr 2025,Business,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywg25ykqno,"There is an opportunity for a ""big deal"" between the US and China on trade, America's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said.
Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an ""incredible opportunity"" to strike an agreement, if China was ""serious"" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.
""China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,"" he said.
The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.
US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.
These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.
Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a ""matter of impetus and will"".
""There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.
""If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.""
The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected a de-escalation of the trade war and that the current situation was ""not a joke"".
Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".
Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.
Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.
Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as ""climate change, gender and social issue"".
""These issues are not the IMF's mission,"" he said.
Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was ""very frankly encouraged"" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.
Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are ""falling short"" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.
He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and ""push them to accomplish their important mandates""."
Councillors agree £11m funding for Exceat Bridge,Councillors agree to redirect more than £11m towards plans to replace Exceat Bridge in East Sussex.,22 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89gq4x15zjo,"Councillors have agreed to commit additional funding to plans to replace a bridge in East Sussex.
In a meeting earlier, East Sussex County Council cabinet members agreed to ""redirect"" more than £11m towards plans to replace Exceat Bridge.
A two-way bridge will replace the current single-lane structure, which forms part of the A259 between Seaford and Eastbourne.
The proposals saw opposition from some councillors, who argued the project was proving to be too expensive and should be dropped altogether, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The funding decision comes a little more than a month after the project was set to be discontinued due to rising costs.
Cabinet members had previously considered plans to construct a like-for-like replacement of the existing structure.
But Councillor Nick Bennett, Conservative cabinet member for resources and climate change, said: ""If we build a single-lane bridge now, in 20 years time people will think that we've missed a great opportunity to build something far more substantial that supports the infrastructure for a long time.""
The additional funding for the project is to be taken from money tied to the council's Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP).
There are expected to be disruption to other projects within the BSIP because of the reallocation, councillors were told.
Green Party councillor Johnny Denis said: ""[Traffic in Newhaven] is the biggest pinch point of all; for everybody, for the maximum number of users.
""That ought to be the priority, not this white elephant, or should we call it a red herring in terms of traffic solutions on the A259.""

Plan for England's largest wind farm 'scaled back',"If approved, a wind farm on moors above Hebden Bridge will have fewer turbines than first planned.",29 Apr 2025,West Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyw0z9dkv4o,"Plans for the largest onshore wind farm in England have been scaled back by a developer.
Calderdale Energy Park said it would apply for permission to build 41 turbines instead of the 65 originally planned on land near Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire.
A consultation period has now begun and people have been invited to submit their views on the project over the next six weeks.
A spokesperson for the company said it had also ""removed the solar panel element"" from the revised designs.
The company first revealed the plans in 2023 and said the scheme would generate enough electricity to power more than 286,000 homes a year.
However, environmental campaigners have said the development would disturb peat bogs on Walshaw Moor and release carbon into the atmosphere.
The firm's spokesperson said:  ""We're pleased to be able share our updated proposals for Walshaw Moor and look forward to hearing from local people about our ambitions.
""Our latest plan includes up to 41 turbines - a reduction from 65. We have also removed the solar panel element from the design.
""Calderdale Energy Park presents a key opportunity to support the government's target to achieve at least 95% of low carbon energy generation by 2030.""
Large parts of Walshaw Moor are blanket bog and protected peatland.
Sandra Rout, from campaign group Stop Calderdale Wind Farm, said: ""Building wind farms on protected peatland, which is a natural carbon sink, is counterproductive - it will worsen the climate and nature crisis by releasing CO2.
""In addition to the turbines, this site would incorporate 22 miles (35 km) of access roads and a substation.""
She said the group feared the plans would lead to increased risk of flooding at Hebden Bridge and nearby towns.
""There are plenty of other suitable sites for wind farms, as identified in a report by the RSPB,"" she said.
""We are calling for government-led action to plan where this technology goes.""
The application to build the wind farm will be decided by the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband MP, after the site was designated a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP).
It means that although Calderdale Council can be consulted, councillors will not have the final say on whether the project proceeds.
Currently the largest wind farm in England is at Keadby in Lincolnshire, where there are 34 turbines.
The largest in the UK is at Whitelee near Glasgow with 215 turbines.

Liberal Party names first female leader after historic Australia election loss,Sussan Ley takes over from Peter Dutton after he led the party to a bruising loss at an election earlier this month.,1 day ago,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrn4x1xr2do,"Australia's Liberal Party has for the first time chosen a woman as its leader, with Sussan Ley to take over from Peter Dutton after he led the party to a bruising election loss.
Ley, from the moderate faction of the party, beat Angus Taylor - who ran on a promise to restore conservative values - by four votes.
At the election on 3 May, the Liberal-National coalition, currently Australia's main opposition party, suffered what many are calling the worst defeat in its history.
Pundits and MPs have blamed the result on polarising leaders, a messy campaign and ""Trumpian"" policies, which alienated women and young people in particular.
Ley's appointment comes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in at Government House on Tuesday, following his Labor Party's landslide election win.
According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Labor has won at least 93 seats - increasing their majority by 16 - while the Coalition has 42 electorates, down from 58. Some seats are still too close to call.
Ley has held the massive regional New South Wales seat of Farrer since 2001 and has served as a senior minister in a variety of portfolios - making her one of the Liberal Party's most experienced hands. She was also the party deputy under Dutton.
Ted O'Brien, a Queensland MP who was the energy spokesman in charge of selling the coalition's controversial nuclear power proposal, was elected Ley's deputy.
Ley said she wanted to help the party rebuild its relationship with Australians - particularly the women and young people who felt they'd been neglected.
""We have to have a Liberal Party that respects modern Australia, that reflects modern Australia, and that represents modern Australia. And we have to meet the people where they are,"" she said.
She told reporters the party's loss would be subject to a review - as would all of its policies, including its position on nuclear and its net zero emissions goal.
""I want to do things differently, and we have to have a fresh approach,"" she said.
""I committed to my colleagues that there would be no captain's calls from anywhere by me... that we would work through every single policy issue and canvas the different views and take the time to get it right.""
In a statement after the leadership vote, unsuccessful contender Taylor congratulated Ley and called for unity.
""Sussan has led a remarkable life and becoming the first woman to lead the Liberal Party is a milestone for Sussan and our party,"" he said.
The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected leader David Littleproud on Monday, after he too was challenged by a hardline conservative colleague.
Albanese's new cabinet was also sworn in on Tuesday.
The biggest changes include former Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek swapping from the environment portfolio to social services, and former communications minister Michelle Rowland becoming attorney general.
Former Attorney General Mark Dreyfus and Ed Husic - the first Muslim to become an Australian government minister - were both removed from the frontbench.
""I have got people who are, I think, in the best positions and that's across the board,"" Albanese said when announcing the positions on Monday.
Born in Nigeria to English parents, Ley grew up in the United Arab Emirates before moving to Australia at age 13.
""Travelling, and being at boarding school on my own, I think you either sink or swim,"" Ley said in a previous interview. ""Obviously, I was someone who decided very early on in life that I wasn't going to sink.""
It was as a young woman that she changed her name from Susan to Sussan, inspired by numerology - an ancient belief that numbers have a mystical impact on people's lives.
""I read about this numerology theory that if you add the numbers that match the letters in your name you can change your personality,"" she told The Australian.
""I worked out that if you added an 's' I would have an incredibly exciting, interesting life and nothing would ever be boring. It's that simple.""
""And once I'd added the 's' it was really hard to take it away.""
As an adult she has had a ""wonderfully varied"" career path, Ley says, obtaining degrees in economics and accounting while raising three young children, earning a commercial pilot licence, and working in the outback mustering livestock.
Elected in 2001 to represent an area the size of New Zealand, Ley was promoted to Health Minister under Malcom Turnbull in 2014, but resigned two years later amid an expenses scandal.
Ley apologised after using a taxpayer-funded trip to purchase an apartment on Queensland's Gold Coast.
She re-joined the frontbench in 2019 after Scott Morrison's ""miracle"" election win, as the Minister for Environment.
In that role, she was taken to court by a group who claimed she had a duty of care towards children to protect them from harm caused by climate change. Eight teenagers and an 87-year-old nun convinced a court that the government had a legal duty towards them when assessing fossil fuel projects, but the landmark decision was later overturned.
Ley has also drawn headlines for her comments about Palestinians. She was a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, an informal cross-party group which aimed to raise the experiences of Palestinian people and has spoken in the chamber in support of Palestinian autonomy.
However, speaking after the vote on Tuesday, one of her colleagues Andrew Wallace said she has ""seen the light on Israel in recent years""."
Oil and gas firm plans to cut 250 jobs in Aberdeen,"Harbour Energy, a critic of the windfall tax, claims a ""punitive"" fiscal regime is harming profits and investment.",7 days ago,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq676vjmj43o,"The UK's largest oil and gas producer has said it expects to cut a further 250 jobs in Aberdeen.
Harbour Energy said it had launched a review of its UK operations and had to take ""difficult steps"", blaming regulation and ""punitive"" government measures.
The UK government said its thoughts were with any workers affected by the ""commercial decision"".
Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC) described the news as a ""devastating blow"".
Harbour Energy had previously announced the loss of 350 UK onshore jobs in 2023.
Harbour Energy has been a vocal critic of the Energy Profits Levy, known as the windfall tax, introduced by the Conservative UK government in 2022 and extended after Labour came to power last year.
The UK government said at the time it was strengthening the tax to ensure North Sea oil and gas producers contribute their fair share towards the energy transition.
It has also pointed to its decision to headquarter Great British Energy in Aberdeen and establish a national wealth fund to help unlock investment in renewables.
But Harbour Energy has claimed it faces excessive taxation which has wiped out profits and undermined investment in its North Sea operations.
Scott Barr, managing director of the firm's UK business, said a review was expected to result in 250 job losses in Aberdeen - about a quarter of its workforce in the city -  in addition to the 350 job cuts previously announced.
He said: ""The review is unfortunately necessary to align staffing levels with lower levels of investment, due mainly to the government's ongoing punitive fiscal position and a challenging regulatory environment.""
The issue was raised at Prime Minister's Questions, with SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn accusing Sir Keir Starmer of ""destroying jobs in Scotland"".
He said: ""That's 250 jobs in my constituency gone in the blink of an eye and do you know who they blame, Mr Speaker? They blame the policies of the Labour Party.""
The prime minister said ""nobody wants to see job losses"", but accused the SNP of trying to ""distract from their disastrous record"" after nearly two decades in government.
The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch also raised the Harbour Energy job losses.
The prime minister accused her of being a ""climate defeatist"".
A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our thoughts are with any workers affected by this commercial decision, and we will do everything in our power to support workers and communities.
""The government has reformed the Energy Profits Levy to support investment and give industry certainty and stability.""
Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 250-plus families directly affected - and I fear it is just the tip of the iceberg.""
In March, the UK government launched a consultation on plans to replace the windfall tax on the profits of energy companies when it comes to an end in 2030.
The energy transition, from fossil to clean and green, is not going smoothly.
There are significant job losses from oil and gas: partly because it is in long-term decline, partly because the oil price has dropped by nearly a third since mid-January, costs have gone up, and also – as cited today by Harbour Energy – because UK government policy is against it.
Tax on profits runs at 78% and the Labour government is refusing to grant new drilling licences.
The industry complains that this accelerates the momentum towards winding down production, despite evidence that the UK will continue to need oil and gas for decades to come, and despite the higher carbon output linked to importing oil and gas.
The UK government's argument is that low-carbon energy ought to pick up where oil and gas are in decline.
But that's not looking good either. Harbour Energy is also reviewing its carbon capture project on Humberside, blaming delayed government support.
Orsted, the Danish company with a hard-won contract guaranteeing a minimum price, has halted one of the biggest of North Sea wind farms - Hornsea 4.
Costs are also being blamed by renewable energy company Drax on its decision to halt a big project to expand hydro generation on Ben Cruachan near Oban.
Investors more widely are waiting for important market signals from the UK government and regulator Ofgem before they commit many billions of pounds."
House building costs highest in London - report,Analysis on housebuilding costs was revealed at The Centre for London's Housing Summit on Wednesday.,2 May 2025,London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr7lejgj9o,"The cost of building homes in London is more than in other parts of England, think tank analysis has found.
The Centre for London reported the upfront cost of constructing 88,000 new homes a year, the government's annual target for the capital, is roughly 43 times higher than the equivalent target in the West Midlands.
The research was shared at the centre's 2025 housing summit on Wednesday, where Sem Moema, chair of the London Assembly housing committee, said: ""If we don't fix the housing crisis, the character of the city will be extinguished.""
A Mayor of London spokesperson said: ""The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes.""
Separate polling by the think tank, which is politically independent, found 60% of Londoners surveyed had considered moving out of the capital due to housing costs rising over the past 12 months, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said.
Ms Moema, a Labour member representing Hackney, Islington and Waltham Forest at City Hall, said: ""I see in my own constituency the hollowing out that occurs and continues to occur, when the failure to fix the housing crisis for a decade and a half changes the character of our city, and not for the better.
""In all three boroughs, we're being forced to consider closing schools, because there are basically no children left in northeast London.
""Families can no longer afford to own or even rent properties in my boroughs.""
Centre for London's research found the crisis is being exacerbated by the upfront cost to developers being at least £2.2bn, if they built enough homes to hit the government's target in the capital.
The estimate was produced by combining the costs associated with the Building Safety Levy, Section 106 agreements, the Community Infrastructure Levy and planning fees for local councils, according to the analysis.
The figure in the West Midlands metropolitan county – which includes Birmingham – was only £50.6m, and only slightly higher in Greater Manchester at £61.3m.
In the London borough of Wandsworth alone, which had the highest cost of any London council area, according to the LDRS, the estimate was £253.9m.
Ms Moema said: ""We have a generation who will never get on to the property ladder independently.
""We need to confront this reality. As with climate change, the costs of not doing anything will be greater than the costs of further investment.""
A spokesperson for the mayor said: ""The mayor is working hard to turn things around, building on a strong track record of delivering tens of thousands of genuinely affordable homes across the capital and more new council homes than any time since the 1970s.""
Commenting on the Labour government's approach to tackling the housing crisis, Centre for London CEO Antonia Jennings said: ""We've seen increased investment in the Affordable Homes Programme, planning reform which allow building on low-quality sections of the green belt and the new Renters Reform Bill.
""But, these are only the very first steps.""
She added: ""We urgently need ambitious solutions that respond to the scale of the challenges facing the capital.
""The government must get behind London's leaders and invest in the capital to finally turn the corner on the housing crisis.""
The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has said meeting the housing challenge in London is a ""crucial part"" of its national mission to build 1.5m homes and kickstart economic growth.
The government added that it had made ""£200m available through the Brownfield Infrastructure and Land fund to strategic sites across the capital"".
Another £81m from the Housing Infrastructure Fund is also being given to Transport for London (TfL) to make improvements to Surrey Quays Station and ""unlock more than 8,000 new homes in Southwark and Lewisham"".

Rare Iron Age textile to go on display for first time,"The piece of fine woven yarn is almost 2,500 years old and dates back to the early to middle part of the Iron Age.",23 Apr 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41e6dr2p1o,"An ancient textile which gives a unique insight into Iron Age Scotland is to go on display for the first time.
The piece of fine woven yarn is almost 2,500 years old and dates back to the early to middle part of the Iron Age.
It was previously thought to be too fragile to display, but following conservation work it has gone on permanent display at the Scottish Crannog Centre in Kenmore, Perthshire.
The textile, believed to be the oldest of its kind, was originally discovered in 1979 when an Iron Age dwelling house, known as The Oakbank Crannog, was excavated on Loch Tay.
The material had been pushed into silt on the loch bed which led to its survival, having been preserved naturally over thousands of years.
It has been analysed by archaeologists at the University of Glasgow and radiocarbon dated to between 480 - 390BC.
It has also undergone a painstaking stabilisation and conservation process which has enabled it to be displayed safely in a climate-controlled cabinet.
Maureen Kerr, an experimental archaeologist and volunteer at the centre, said: ""The exciting thing is that there's nowhere else in Scotland that has textile of this size and of this age.
""The fine weave is highly unusual for the time and area and, along with the fact there are remnants of a possible hem, it makes it a very rare and special discovery.
""We believe this is the oldest of its type in Scotland.""
It is considered a unique example of a 2/1 twill weave, shedding light on some of the technologies society had in the Iron Age.
Dr Susanna Harris, senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Glasgow, analysed the textile on behalf of the centre.
She said: ""Wool was such an important material in Scotland, so it's been exciting to examine this piece.
""It's really important finds like this go on display.
""It may be a small piece of textile but it tells us a lot about the heritage of Scottish textiles.""
Crannogs were dwelling houses built on stilts over water and usually had a bridge connecting them to the shore.
The first crannogs in Scotland were built on lochs from Neolithic times.
The Scottish Crannog Centre's reconstructed crannog was destroyed by fire in 2021.
It opened on its new and enlarged site near Kenmore last year and the build team is  completing a new crannog using sustainable and historical construction methods."
"No hosepipe ban in 2025, says water firm",The water firm says there are no plans for a ban despite the increasingly warm weather.,6 May 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3v0p13ykqo,"Severn Trent Water has said it is confident there will be no hosepipe ban this year, despite a new record for the hottest start to any May on record.
The last time such a ban was imposed by the company was in 1995.
At the time, it meant people in affected areas were unable to use hosepipes to water gardens, clean their cars or fill paddling pools.
A spokesperson for the water firm said: ""We've not had a hosepipe ban for 30 years. Despite one of the warmest April's in over 100 years, we're confident that record will continue this summer as we deliver two billion litres of water to 4.6 million homes every single day.""
Howard Perry, from Severn Trent Water, which supplies people in much of the Midlands, said: ""Lots of activity and investment is going into the network to avoid a hosepipe ban.
""We have seen the impact of climate change in terms of hotter and drier summers. If we look at our longer term trends, we can see that.
""Our plans are to invest to make sure that we don't have to reduce supplies to customers.
""We've got £1.1bn going in over the next five years on water supply schemes, we're reducing the amount we take from the environment and we're reducing leakage by another 16 per cent over the next five years.
""We're also doing proactive mains renewal, we're investing £400m in that.""
However the company is urging customers to still be mindful of their water usage.
Mr Perry said: ""Do use water wisely. Every leak that you've got on your property can use tens, hundreds, thousands of litres that other people could be using.
""Some of the big garden uses of water like jet washes and hoses, there's much more sensible ways such as using watering cans that will help make sure there's enough water around for everybody.""

'People's Pope' and 'Battle for Church's future',"The death of Pope Francis, aged 88, dominates the front pages of the major UK papers.",22 Apr 2025,The Papers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pr4710e8o,"The news of the Pope's death dominates the front pages.
""The People's Pope"" is the main headline for the Daily Star, Daily Mirror and the i Paper, which hail Francis as a ""charismatic champion of the poor"". The Times describes him as an ""outsider"" whose mission was to change the Catholic Church.
""A modernising pontiff in an era of populism and polarisation"" is the assessment of the Financial Times, while the Guardian describes him as ""groundbreaking"" and praises his advocacy, particularly in the fight to combat climate change.
""One last Easter blessing and his work was done"" is the Daily Telegraph's poignant headline, in reference to Pope Francis taking part in Easter services less than 24 hours before his death. Metro takes a similar line, describing the Pope as ""serving to the very last"" alongside a picture of him touching the hand of a young girl during his final tour of St Peter's Square.
The Daily Express focuses on British reaction with tributes from the King and Queen and an appreciation by the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell. He says Pope Francis's legacy will continue to shape the world for years to come.
The Sun and the Daily Mail say the world is united in mourning, with the latter describing the Pope's death as a ""pivotal moment"" with a battle to shape the future direction of the Catholic Church now beginning. The Mirror says it is imperative his legacy is built upon, not undone.
""Trump leads drive to wean Americans off their fixation with paper cheques"" is a front page headline for the Financial Times, which highlights attempts by Donald Trump's administration to get more US consumers to switch to electronic payment systems. It reports that despite plunging use elsewhere in the world, cheque payments remain commonplace in the US.
And pretty much every paper is carrying the story of wild chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau who have been observed sharing and enjoying fermented alcoholic fruit together. As the Guardian puts it, not in quantities to get roaring drunk but possibly enough for a fuzzy beer-buzz feeling. Scientists from the University of Exeter, who conducted the study, say the animals' behaviour suggests alcohol may have benefits for social bonding in chimps - as it does for humans.

"Changing leader not enough to fix Tories, Badenoch says","The Tory leader says her party's comeback will be ""slow and steady"", after her heavy local election losses.",4 May 2025,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y6nv7l635o,"Kemi Badenoch has said it would be wrong to think a change of leader would ""fix everything"" after the Conservatives suffered heavy losses in English local elections.
The Tory leader told the BBC her party would ""come out fighting"" after losing 674 council seats and control of 16 authorities.
But she cautioned against a knee-jerk response, saying the party's issues were ""not going to be fixed after six months"" of her leadership.
She said: ""Reform had a good night. We had a bad night. And what this shows for a lot of people who hoped that just changing leader again would fix everything is that that's not going to be enough. We tried that previously. And that brought us to a historic defeat.""
Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Badenoch said protest was ""in the air"" in these local elections and argued her party was working on a ""slow and steady"" plan to return to government by the end of the decade.
She said: ""We are going to come out with the policies that people want to see, but what we are not going to do is rush out and tell the public things that are not true just so we can win votes.
""This is not about winning elections; this is about fixing our country. Yes, of course, you need to win elections to do that, but you also need a credible plan.""
Asked if it was feasible that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister, she  said ""anything is feasible"", noting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had won re-election this week after trailing in the polls.
But she added: ""My job is to make sure that he [Farage] does not become prime minister because he does not have the answers to the problems the country is facing.""
Badenoch was a cabinet minister in the previous Conservative government and took over as party leader last November, following its worst defeat ever in a general election.
The former leader of North Northamptonshire council, Jason Smithers, told the BBC he would call for Badenoch to resign as leader following this week's results.
But shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick - a previous contender for the Tory leadership - has backed Badenoch, telling the BBC she was doing an ""excellent job"".
The results in the local elections were worse than Conservatives had feared, with the party not only losing councils to Reform but also the Liberal Democrats.
It lost 674 council seats and control of all 16 local authorities it was defending but wrested the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoralty from Labour.
Reform UK was the big winner, taking control of 10 councils and gaining 677 councillors, as the party seemed able to tap into widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and Labour.
The Lib Dems were the other standout winners, gaining 163 seats and control of three councils. They seized Shropshire from the Tories and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire after both previously had no party in overall control.
The Green Party made some gains, winning 44 seats in total - however it suffered disappointment in the West of England mayoral race.
The BBC is estimating that, if elections had taken place across the UK on Thursday, the Conservatives would have slumped to just 15% of the national vote, its worst-ever share of such a projection, behind the Liberal Democrats on 17%.
Labour would have won 20% of the vote, according to the projection, equalling its lowest previous recorded performance in 2009.
Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Laura Kuenssberg Labour had ""got the message"" in these local elections and asked voters to ""give us a bit of time"" to change things.
When asked about Labour's record in government since winning the last general election, Streeting said ""there's no doubt that there are some individual things we've done that people have not liked"".
He added: ""Every single measure we have taken to raise more money for the NHS has been unpopular, has been contested.
But he claimed it was already showing results in terms of reduced waiting lists.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party had achieved strong results across the country and had taken the title of ""party of Middle England"" from the Conservatives.
He said many people would be worried about Reform UK controlling councils and what Farage had said about cutting spending on climate change initiatives and special education needs.
Sir Ed said the Lib Dems were taking on Reform UK in many areas.
""If we can expose the fact that Nigel Farage is so keen on Donald Trump that will mean that the Liberal Democrats can come through,"" he said.
The Green Party had also made big strides across the country, its co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the programme.
Speaking about Reform UK's performance, he said the success of Farage's party was not built on strong foundations.
""It remains to be seen whether they're willing to put in the hard yards,"" Ramsay said. ""Green councillors have a strong track record in our communities.""
But asked why the Greens didn't do as well as Reform UK in these elections, Ramsay said his party was still ""growing"" and urged voters to ""be part of our movement"" if they wanted a different kind of politics."
Toad makes 'wonderful' comeback at national park,It is the first time natterjack toads have been recorded breeding at the Blackmoor site in 50 years.,2 days ago,Hampshire & Isle of Wight,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje73exjd74o,"The natterjack toad, the UK's loudest amphibian, has made a ""remarkable comeback"" at a national park following a conservation project.
A total of 28 toadlets were recently counted at Blackmoor, Hampshire, in the South Downs, following the reintroduction programme, which started in 2021.
It is the first time natterjack toads have been recorded breeding at the site in 50 years.
The toad, which has a distinctive rasping call that can be heard up to a mile away, had previously only been found on a single site in the national park at Woolmer Forest.
In neighbouring Sussex it is considered locally extinct.
The Amphibian and Reptile Conservation (ARC) charity has led work to provide new suitable territory for the toads.
This included creating shallow ponds and restoring heathlands for the introduction of cattle grazing to create ""perfect conditions"" for them to return.
Jack Harper from ARC said: ""We are delighted that everyone's hard work is beginning to pay off and that the future of this fascinating species is looking brighter in the region.
""This is a great first step to recovering the species within the national park and a good blueprint for future reintroduction efforts.""
Olivia French, heathlands project team leader for the park, said it was a ""wonderful success story for nature recovery"" that shows ""wildlife can thrive if given half a chance"".
The future for natterjack toads was ""certainly looking brighter than it was"", she said, with a breeding population at Woolmer and now Blackmoor as well.
""This area is the last heathland bastion for this iconic species and extending their habitat range is a big step forward in stopping the species becoming locally extinct,"" she added.
Ms French said that 75% of breeding sites in the UK had disappeared in the past century.
The toads are now almost exclusively confined to coastal sand dune systems and grazing marshes in north-west England and the Solway Firth in Scotland.
She added: ""They are one of the most at-risk species from climate change because of rising sea levels, so this makes the comeback in Hampshire all the more significant.""

US halts construction of giant wind farm off New York coast,The pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.,17 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7d8lz7wjo,"The Trump administration has halted construction of a vast wind farm off the coast of New York, which was designed to provide enough electricity to power 500,000 homes.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the Biden administration had ""rushed through"" the approval of the Empire Wind 1 project ""without sufficient analysis"".
The halt is a major blow to the US wind industry, which was championed by former President Joe Biden - but has been targeted heavily by President Trump.
In the days after his return to office, Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at the industry - including a temporary freeze on federal permits and loans for offshore and onshore wind projects.
""We're not going to do the wind thing,"" Trump said at the time, calling them ""big, ugly windmills"" that were dangerous to wildlife.
New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, described the halt of Empire Wind 1 as ""federal overreach"" and said she would fight it ""every step of the way"".
Equinor, the Norwegian company that is leading the Empire Wind project, said in a statement: ""We have decided to stop offshore construction of the project following the order.""
""We will engage with the administration to find out why the order was issued after we had received all the permits previously.""
Equinor acquired a lease of the site from the federal government in 2017 and, according to its website, the project was set to deliver 810 MW of energy into Brooklyn, powering 500,000 homes.
Trump has previously claimed, without evidence, that wind turbines kill whales.
Before becoming president, he battled - and ultimately failed - to stop the construction of a wind farm off the coast of his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland."
Couple who set up theatre 'overwhelmed' by its success,"Every show put on at Backyard Theatre so far has sold out, say Neil Wilson and Cath Cooper.",20 Apr 2025,Somerset,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48pg9k02eo,"A couple who opened a 90-seat theatre in November say they have been ""overwhelmed with happiness"" at its popularity.
Neil Wilson and Cath Cooper said, so far, every show put on at Backyard Theatre in Watchet, Somerset, has sold out.
Performances at the theatre include a one-man show called Frankenstein (on a Budget) and a folk musical called The Musicians of Bremen.
Ms Cooper said: ""We really wanted there to be a theatre in Watchet. A town without a theatre is a strange thing really because most towns have some performance space. This is a dream come true.""
The theatre had previously been a skittle alley, so already had a bar and toilets.
To complete its transformation, Mr Wilson renovated the space, with the help of volunteers, adding a full lighting rig and a backstage dressing room.
""We can put on our own shows and do what we want to,"" Mr Wilson said.
The couple already have business experience, having run Watchet's Radio Museum – which sits right next to the theatre.
Mr Wilson runs the technical side of the operation, while Ms Cooper finds the shows.
Ms Cooper said she had previously retired, only to find the theatre has now become a full-time job.
She praised the army of volunteers helping on show days.
""We're overwhelmed with happiness that this has become a success,"" she said.

Zero carbon research team aims to change the world,The team at the new Zero Carbon Innovation Centre want to make sustainable transport a reality.,16 Apr 2025,Nottinghamshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39jxz97z00o,"Sustainable air travel. Electric HGVs. Hydrogen-powered shipping.
These are just some of the projects researchers are expected to work on at the new Zero Carbon Innovation Centre (ZCIC) in the East Midlands.
Based at the University of Nottingham, with another site at Loughborough University, the centre's priority is to develop new ""sustainable"" transport technology to power the aeroplanes, lorries and ships that currently run on climate-damaging fossil fuels.
Transport is the biggest contributor to UK greenhouse gas emissions with increasing traffic outweighing the benefits of more efficient engines.
Leaders at the new centre says their aim is to close the gap between academic research and industrial application.
The facility has funding commitments of more than £75m from industry, public and academic investment.
The largest space at the ZCIC is occupied by four manufacturing robots, an overhead crane and an electric car.
In offices labelled ""incubation space"", engineers and scientists are already hard at work, but the doors remain firmly closed to uninvited visitors.
The man in charge of strategy here, Prof Henner Wapenhans, explains their work is already too commercially sensitive to share.
""Our vision is to accelerate sustainability, to accelerate decarbonisation of the world and have an economic impact in the region,"" he says.
""By the end of year this facility will be buzzing with advanced manufacturing and assembly lines for electrical machines that could power ships or aircraft.
""I think within 10 to 20 years, we're going to see sustainable aviation with zero emissions perhaps driven by hydrogen fuel.
""[We'll see] electrical machines which are much more powerful in a smaller space using new green fuels.""
According to Prof Wapenhans, those machines could be quickly adapted and switched to provide engines for long distance transport on land or sea, as well as in the air.
Some climate change campaigners worry that, too often, our search for solutions to the climate crisis centres on new technologies, which always seem to be ""a decade away"", rather than on changing how we live and exploiting existing proven technologies.
Prof Dani Strickland is part of the Loughborough team that is focusing on hydrogen production and storage.
She recognises the argument but says research into sustainable, cheap solutions is still essential.
""The existing solutions are often not market-ready and may be too expensive or not recyclable,"" she says.
""There's no point in developing all this technology and making it too expensive to buy or to use. That's why we're particularly proud of all the low-cost work we're doing.""
As an example, she points to her team's production of a 3D-printed ""battery electrolyser"".
The battery stores electricity generated from renewable sources, such as solar. Once the battery is full, excess energy can be used to generate green hydrogen.
Three years ago it was a Masters project.
This year the university is shipping three containers to Malawi, the Ivory Coast and Zambia to provide hydrogen for clean cooking based on solar cells.
""[The centre] is all about creating a low carbon ecosystem,"" she says.
""You create this really exciting, vibrant community within the East Midlands to make things happen. It's about taking new technology and bringing it to market in a very short timescale.""
The centre sits near the university's Power Electronics and Machines Centre (PEMC) and a few hundred metres away from where they are building a new hydrogen propulsion lab, which is due to open in 2026.
It is all part of a ""zero carbon cluster"" billed as ""the place where zero carbon innovation drives real-world solutions"".
Various industries will be able to use the cluster to test new technologies, allowing their staff to share ideas and skills with academic researchers at the top of their field.
Katie Greenhalgh heads up green growth at East Midlands Freeport, which has invested £6m in the ZCIC.
She says the centre fits with their goals of driving economic growth and attracting new businesses to the region.
She hopes it will also help them meet their commitments to sustainability and decarbonisation.
""This is one of the first investments we've made as a freeport,"" she says.
""We're definitely not shying away from a challenge. We have an airport, we have an old coal-fired power station, we have logistics and manufacturing.
""These sectors are really challenging to decarbonise but initiatives like this are creating the breakthrough technologies that we need in order to tackle all those really difficult to treat sectors.""
Prof Wapenhans believes by helping to develop skills, the centre will boost jobs and make the region more competitive.
""The East Midlands has strong industry and a thriving SME [small and medium enterprise] supply chain, he says.
""There will be jobs from PhDs to the mechanics on the workbench.""

VE Day 80: Poignant thank you to a heroic generation,"VE Day 80 sees big crowds supporting surviving veterans of World War Two, our correspondent writes.",5 May 2025,UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8j69pz49no,"This VE Day 80 parade was a celebration that paid its respects, with some poignancy, to the wartime generation. There was an understated warmth that suited the moment.
This week's events will be one of the last big public moments of recognition for the diminishing number of veterans from World War Two.
For Monday's events, veterans had pride of place on a viewing platform at the top of the Mall, sitting alongside the Royal Family and the prime minister, watching the military parade and marching bands.
These veterans are now in their late 90s and older, commemorating an event which took place when many were still only teenagers.
In today's fragile political climate there is often talk about defending democracy.
But these veterans had actually done that and won, and remain now as some of the last representatives of a generation that fought Nazism and all of the intolerance and barbarism that represented.
Many of those who had cared for others were now reliant on carers for themselves. It's a different kind of battle.
On the viewing platform King Charles was chatting to Joy Trew, a wireless operator in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, who was 18 on VE Day in 1945. This summer she will be 99 years old.
She said the King had helped tuck in a blanket to keep her warm on a chilly day. And she had told the King about the other female veterans: ""A lot of the women look formidable and he said 'yes'.""
After the modern RAF paid its own tribute with a thundering flypast, the veterans were slowly wheeled across to Palace, in one last column.
They were heading for a tea party held in their honour, with the King and Queen and Prince and Princess of Wales hearing first hand stories that will soon slip into history.
Joyce Wilding, aged 100, remembered the celebrations in London on VE Day: ""We went to Piccadilly where there was a stream of people singing and dancing, there were soldiers up lampposts, it was extraordinary.
""We were outside Buckingham Palace and you could hardly move there were so many people cheering and singing.""
In that euphoric moment, the King's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, then 19, had also secretly gone out among the crowds and had been part of a conga at the Ritz hotel.
Among the older guests was Henry Ducker, now aged 104, who was only 19 when he joined the RAF in 1940, working as a flight mechanic. He had spent VE Day in Italy.
He said Queen Camilla had been ""quite funny, very humorous"".
This 80th anniversary event had drawn big crowds along the Mall. They had given a particularly warm welcome to the Ukrainian contingent in the parade, carrying the blue and yellow flag of their country. It was a sharp reminder of present conflicts as well as those from the past.
The King had stood on the viewing platform, saluting the different military formations as they marched past. Was he thinking of his own grandfather, George VI, who had waved from the balcony on the original VE night?
Compared with reports of the feverish celebrations in 1945, these were relatively restrained crowds at this commemorative event. They were quietly paying their respects, many perhaps with their own thoughts and memories.
As is often the case with modern crowds, many were more interested in taking photos on their phones than cheering.
There is also an unmistakable growing distance in time.
Prince George was at Buckingham Palace for the tea party for veterans, listening in to the stories. But it's a long way back for his generation, with a 68-year gap between his birth and VE Day.
It's the same distance as between his father Prince William's birth and the outbreak of the First World War.
There were nostalgic street parties, but when younger generations hear about ""spam"" they'll be thinking about their email rather than the food cupboard.
This first big day of VE Day 80 commemorations caught the sense of reflection. The mood in London was good natured and supportive. Even the rain held off until the parade was over.
There were neighbourhood gatherings, from local community groups to Downing Street, celebrating the wartime spirit and a sense of togetherness.
And such public events might be a chance to privately remember those who had made sacrifices without ever seeking recognition.
It's a moment when memories are passed from one generation to the next and stories turn into history.

Why alligators are the Everglades' bodyguards,These 'gnarly swamp monsters' are breathing life into Florida's Everglades.,19 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250417-how-alligators-keep-floridas-everglades-healthy,"The Everglades' eclectic alligators are surprisingly diverse builders, bodyguards, commuters, and health-bringing engineers.
From the edge of the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, in the north of the Florida Everglades, it is a short fan-boat ride through grassy swamp to get to an island that 18-year-old Hector Tigertail's family visit each year. For decades, this family ""hammock"" – as the tree-covered islands that poke out from the Everglades are known – has been their retreat; a place where the family can camp, cook and hunt. But they share this particular island with at least one permanent resident: an American alligator that, at around 7ft (2.1m) from nose to tail, is the largest female he's ever seen.
Tigertail's family, members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and this powerful reptile, which locals refer to as Mama Gator, have lived side by side for much of the 60-year-old animal's life, he explains. This intimate coexistence provides a chance to observe how alligators meticulously shape their surroundings. Through the dry season between December and May, she excavates a ""gator pond"" with her snout, claws and tail, a depression where water pools and she can wallow, keep cool and mate. At the start of the rainy season (from June to November), she builds a raised nest for her clutch of eggs, from mud, grass and twigs – a time when the humans know to keep a respectful distance from the protective mother. In return, for the next few years, they are often rewarded with the sight of Mama and her baby gators in tow.
""We like to call her Mama Gator because she's everybody's grandma,"" says Tigertail.
In recent years, scientific research is adding support to something Florida's Miccosukee Tribe have long known: alligators like Mama play vital roles as ""guardians of the Everglades"" and engineer their environment in ways that protect freshwater ecosystems. Alligators carry around nutrients that feed ecosystem webs, and their ponds and nests provide refuges where plants, fish and frogs live. New data hints that that alligators may also benefit us.
""Apex predator or not, alligators are actually very helpful and they can change the ecosystem significantly,"" says Tigertail, who researches alligators for the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department. ""During the dry season, a lot of animals –  deer, fish, otters, turtles, birds –  follow the alligators.""
For those like biologist Christopher Murray who has spent decades closely studying alligators, it's high time to move past their reputation as cold-hearted killers and recognise the varied roles they're playing as caring and constructive ecosystem engineers. While the cute, herbivorous beaver is widely celebrated for stewarding temperate wetlands, it is the ""gnarly swamp monsters"" who deserve plaudits in the southeastern United States and many other places, says Murray, associate professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. ""I think we're just beginning to understand that crocodilians, in general, and specifically alligators, do a lot more good than we think.""
Alligators are often called ""living fossils"", relatively untouched by major evolutionary changes for at least eight million years, with remarkably similar ancestors already hunting swamps alongside the dinosaurs. Yet, beginning in the 1850s, the arrival of rifle-wielding European settlers into the wetlands of Florida and Louisiana drove this evolutionary line to the verge of extinction.
More than 10 million alligators were killed by commercial hunting up to the 1960s, driven by the popularity of their hides for bags, belts and boots, with others shot for sport or ""just for fun"" according to historical accounts. In 1967, American alligators were placed on endangered species lists, leading to nationwide hunting bans that allowed populations to recover. Today, the species is recognised as a standout conservation success story, as the population has rebounded to more than three million alligators estimated to live in the wild in the states of Florida and Louisiana, and thousands more spread across the south-eastern United States.
Just as conservationists began fighting to save the species from extinction in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began documenting their important ecological roles. In the wet season, the raised ridges around the edge of these nests are relatively dry land where some plants can escape flooding and provide platforms where smaller reptiles build their own nests. Meanwhile wading birds build their own nests above alligators, which act as ""bodyguards"", keeping raccoons and other predators away from the birds' eggs. (More recent research has shown that this is a macabre but overall mutually beneficial arrangement with alligators being rewarded with snacks from chicks that fall from the nests.)
Carbon Count
The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.
Mike Heithaus, professor of biological sciences at Florida International University, explains that, despite its lush appearances, the Everglades can be a nutrient poor environment. A largely flat wetland, dominated by grass-like plants, many key nutrients are carried out to sea by great slow-flowing seasonal rivers, some kilometres wide.
In the dry season, when the water level falls, research since the mid-20th Century has shown that alligators' habit of excavating holes created variety in the otherwise monotonous landscape, with unique communities of plants, animals and algae around ponds. These holes can be architecturally diverse – created by one alligator or up to a dozen together – incorporating eclectic ""burrows and hidey-holes"", says Heithaus, including underwater caverns, where the alligator can stay submerged for hours. These aquatic environments form refuges in which fish like juvenile largemouth bass survive the dry season but can also be ""death traps"" which lure birds in search of a snack, he adds.
We're now learning these are surprisingly dynamic systems. Research in 2023 showed that it was not only the construction of the ponds that counted ""but actively being in the pond matters"", says Heithaus. As the alligators move, they continually stir up the sediment to keep those nutrients in the water. ""The alligators are moving around; they're pooping in there. That's providing nutrients which algae – that form the base of the food web – rely on. So, you kind of prime the pump: you feed the bottom of the food chain and [the nutrients] come all the way up.""
Without alligators, there would be much less nutrients circulated in the water, says Heithaus. ""You put alligators there, and you get food and water, and that's happy times for most critters in the Everglades.""
This research also reveals a lesser-seen side of alligators, spotlighting them as remarkably sophisticated and adaptable creatures. The alligator's reputation as a ""man-eating monster"" was inspired long ago by accounts like William Bartram's widely reproduced (and wildly inaccurate) stories of encountering alligators in Florida swamps with ""clouds of smoke"" erupting from their nostrils. Although attacks on humans are very rare, these cold-blooded animals remain feared by many as killers or ""weird swamp things"", says Murray, who has worked with alligators for more than two decades.
Those who live up close with alligators see other qualities. One alligator in the state of Georgia, named Wally, was even docile enough to be domesticated as an ""emotional support alligator"", providing comfort and ""hugs"" to help alleviate his owner's depression.
Despite the reported gentleness of some individuals, it is recommended to stay at least 9m (30ft) away from alligators in the wild. Alligators are carnivores, powerful enough to bring down a wild deer or feral boar but ""naturally they're going to be more of a flighty, non-confrontational animal,"" says Kendall Osceola, who worked at the Miccosukee Indian Village, the tribe's cultural centre. The Miccosukee learn a strict set of rules from a young age for sharing their coastal homes with gators. ""We were always told if there's a body of water in Florida, there's going to be an alligator in there. So, keep a careful eye on any pets or anything small around the water line,"" she says. Yet Miccosukee stories depict them as ""benevolent creatures"", she says.
More like this:
• How do you re-home a rhino? Upside down
• Elephants hate bees - here's how that helps humans
• A wild 'freakosystem' has been born in Hawaii
Today, alligators have adapted to live in the urbanised environments of golf courses, canals and sewers. Researchers have been surprised by how varied and flexible alligators are, explains Heithaus, yet research in 2011 found behaviours that have shocked even those who study them. Near Miccosukee village, in an area where alligators live in mangrove forests alongside a fast-flowing river, Heithaus and Adam Rosenblatt fitted trackers to alligators, finding that similar alligators lived very different lives – some were ""couch potatoes"" who remain close to home, while others were ""commuters"" who travel long distances to coastal areas. ""Tag two alligators – same size, both males, 20m (65.6ft) apart on the shore – and one will not move more than 7km (4.3 miles) in total in three months, and the other might do 800km (497 miles),"" says Heithaus.
While American alligators have been spotted swimming out in the ocean in the past, prior to this research this behaviour was believed to be extremely rare, says Heithaus. Unlike crocodiles, alligators lack specialised glands to process salt, yet this monitoring showed that some alligators frequently venture out into the ocean when there are abundant saltwater fish and crabs to feast on. ""When we first got some data suggesting the alligators were down in these saltwater environments for maybe 18 hours at a time, we were looked at like we had two heads – people didn't believe it at all,"" says Heithaus. ""And I think it's one of the cool things we're finding across sharks, alligators, and lots of animals – that there's a lot more behavioural adaptability and individual specialisation than we would have thought – bold individuals, shy individuals; exploratory individuals, stay-at-home individuals.""
Heithaus is aiming to figure out what causes these different behaviours – whether genetic or influenced by environmental factors – as well as what role ""commuting"" plays in cycling nutrients around wetland environments. Already, studies have shown that alligator ponds are richer in key nutrients like phosphorus and commuters are carrying nutrients up into the wetlands from coastal areas, by eating in the oceans and excreting upstream. ""We know that they're moving these nutrients upstream,"" says Heithaus. His team at the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Program is seeking a more granular understanding of how this affects the overall ""nutrient budget"" of the ecosystem, where nutrients are deposited, and how it affects the overall system.
Crucially, at a time when the Gulf Coast is being hard hit by the impacts of climate change, we are also learning that alligators may affect their environments' ability to capture carbon. By analysing soil samples across Louisiana, Murray was recently able to demonstrate in a study that areas with high numbers of alligators are rich carbon stores. ""What this paper says to me is: look, we rescued the American alligator from extinction,"" he says, ""but what we didn't realise, back then, was that maybe we were actually doing a lot more for the environment – in the context of carbon sequestration and the battle against climate change – than we previously thought.""
The next step, says Murray, is to show that alligators are actively contributing to higher carbon storage in these areas – and how. We have good reason to think alligators, as apex predators, may be playing a similar ""top-down"" role to the famed wolves of Yellowstone, whose return has reduced herbivore grazing on small trees and helped forests to regrow. The theory of trophic cascades developed by Utah State University ecologist Trisha Atwood has shown that apex predators are not only vital for ecosystem health but could have big impacts on CO2 dynamics. This could be particularly important in freshwater ecosystems like Louisiana's tidally inundated wetlands, which store enormous amounts of carbon, says Murray, but can turn into a carbon source when they dry out.
Murray hopes his forthcoming research can provide further evidence about the value of supporting healthy alligator populations. Although hunting bans were the most important step to save the species from extinction, efforts to protect and restore populations are ongoing and involve groups who are often less recognised, he says. Among them are commercial alligator ranchers who retrieve eggs from the wild, incubate them and raise them through the first few years of life in enclosed or semi-wild environments, safeguarding them when they are most vulnerable to predation and disease. This form of early-years care, known as ""head-starting"", is common in conservation initiatives that aim to help endangered animals – from Eastern indigo snakes to burrowing owls. But, in Louisiana, this is a ""self-funded"" system driven by ranchers, says Murray. These ranchers are required to release 5% of alligators they raise into the wild, while the rest are treated as livestock that can be butchered for meat and hides.
In the Everglades, head-starting is also carried out by the Miccosukee, who rescue eggs in years when water levels in the Everglades rise, threatening to drown eggs, or temperatures fall to levels that can harm baby alligators. ""Sometimes I would be at home and my uncle would tell me: 'Hey, the temperature is dropping really fast. It's going to be a really cold night. So get on the airboat and we have to go out there before the cold weather kills them',"" says Tigertail.
Despite their fearsome reputation, all this hints at a future where humans and alligators coexist, with these reptiles recognised as ""helpful participants"" in solutions to the challenges we both face, says Murray. ""If you think historically, alligators and other crocodilians have been revered as a sacred entity in cultures around the world. Do they command respect? Yes. But are they monsters? Are they to be feared? No.""

"Charity to plant 30,000 trees for mountain woodland",A project aims to restore an almost lost type of habitat in the Cairngorms.,15 Apr 2025,Highlands & Islands,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24q9rem1n4o,"A high-altitude woodland is to be created on Scotland's sixth highest mountain.
About 30,000 native trees, including dwarf birch and montane willows, are to be planted at around 600m (1,968ft) on Cairn Gorm, near Aviemore.
Organisations involved in the Coire na Ciste Montane Woodland Project said it was the first habitat restoration scheme of its kind due to its large size.
They said the plan was to restore an ecosystem that was almost lost to Scotland.
Cairn Gorm is 1,245m (4, 085ft) high and one of Scotland's best known mountains.
The tree planting is being led by the Spey Catchment Initiative (SCI) and funded by the Cairngorms National Park Authority.
Cairngorm Mountain (Scotland) Ltd, which runs a ski resort on the mountain, and landowner Highlands and Islands Enterprise are helping to deliver the project.
The new woodland is to be planted along the banks of a burn called Allt na Ciste.
Penny Lawson, of SCI, said: ""The Coire na Ciste Montane Woodland Project will create essential habitat for rare species, help cool rivers and connect fragmented habitats.
""It's a powerful example of how woodland restoration can deliver nature-based climate action in one of the most special places in Scotland.""
Called montane woodland, the high altitude habitats were once found across Scotland as part of the Caledonian Forest.
It covered huge swathes of Scotland after the end of the last ice age in Scotland about 11,000 years ago.
The forest even reached the Western Isles and Shetland 5,000 years ago.
A change to a cooler and wetter climate, along with human activity, led to a decline in the forest's coverage.
By the 1900s about 5% of Scotland's land area had woodland, according to Scottish government agency NatureScot."
"Moorland wildfire damaged 14,000 new trees",Fire crews were called to a large wildfire near March Haigh Reservoir on 10 April.,29 Apr 2025,West Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqvjw4qqjzo,"A recent wildfire that broke out on Marsden Moor destroyed nearly 14,000 new trees, a councillor has said.
Fire crews were called to a large wildfire near March Haigh Reservoir, near Huddersfield, at about 17:00 BST on 10 April.
The National Trust, which owns the land, and Colne Valley Tree Society, began clearing melted tree guards from the area on Saturday.
Kirklees councillor Matthew McLoughlin, who is part of the tree planting group, said more than a third of the 65,000 new trees planted on the moor had been damaged.
McLoughlin said: ""The vast majority have been completely destroyed and the plastic has melted into where the roots were.
""It obviously means a lot fewer trees growing up and helping the air get cleaner and take carbon down.""
Because the fire did not penetrate the ground itself, some trees could still grow back from the roots - but it was not likely that many would regrow, he said.
The trees were planted as part of the Landscapes for Water preservation project, between the National Trust and Yorkshire Water, and funded by White Rose Forest.
The aim of the project was to improve the upland habitats and make the landscape more resilient to the dangers of climate change.
The trees, planted alongside natural flood management, help to stop water running off the moors and to help prevent the erosion of the peatland.
Peat is a natural resource formed over long periods, mainly in wetland, which stores  carbon.
A Landscapes for Water spokesperson said: ""Our community is at the heart of our work, and it is disheartening to see their hard work affected by the recent moorland fire.
""However, we remain committed to working with them to continue enhancing the landscape across the South Pennines, making it more resilient in the face of these challenges.""
A spokesperson from the National Trust said the next steps for the project are to remove the damaged tree guards, check the trees underneath and protect the unaffected surviving trees.
""We have found that some of the trees have survived, we are working on surveying the area to understand the full extent of the damage,"" the spokesperson added.
The cause of the moorland fire is not yet known, according to investigators.
McLoughlin believes the fire was started deliberately and urged the public to report any suspicious behaviour.

The scientists who leave no trace in the high Arctic,Scientists in the high Arctic are lifting their labs into the air to avoid damage from melting permafrost.,11 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250408-the-scientists-leaving-no-trace-in-the-arctic,"Scientists in the high Arctic are lifting their labs into the air to avoid damage from melting permafrost.
Ny-Ålesund in Norway's Arctic is the world's most northerly settlement. A team of scientists surrounded by glaciers, polars bears, walruses and arctic foxes call this hostile environment home while they're researching the Arctic's ice, ecosystems and atmosphere.
""The polar night is always the hardest,"" explains Marion Maturilli, a scientist studying Arctic climate dynamics with the French and German Polar Institutes, who is based at the station.
For more than 50 years, Ny-Ålesund has housed an international community at the top of the world just 1,200km (745 miles) from the North Pole. Remnants of scientific equipment from the mission which mapped the lines of longitude which define our time zones, still stand at Ny-Ålesund. More recently, Nasa used the base for its satellite lasers and measurements of the Earth's electrical field. Now, scientists from 10 countries live there to conduct their research. For almost three months at a time, they wake and go to sleep in darkness. Their experiments stretch from space to the mysteries of phytoplankton, microplastic pollution, walrus behaviour and alterations in Arctic cyclones.
The need to protect the unique polar archipelago resulted in the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which was one of the world's first international environmental protection agreements. But the impact left on this pristine landscape by the researchers is necessary, the scientists say.
Maturilli's team records long-term series of temperature and solar radiation measurements at Ny-Ålesund. Everyday for 30 years, the team at the German station used a weather balloon to raise a radiosonde – a small instrument which measures atmospheric conditions – which has to be carefully operated to prevent icing up in the clouds. The results are used to make accurate up-to-date weather forecasts but also document the long-term changes of temperature in the upper air of the region.  These measurements depend on having precise and accurate reference points made at the station's high latitudes which give the global coverage and even our place in space.
""It doesn't sound spectacular but our daily measurements have produced reliable data for an international climate reference observing network,"" says Maturilli.
But to limit the impact of the settlement, only around 30 people are permitted live at the research station year-round.
""We do everything we can from planning to execution to change the Arctic as little as possible but this research is vital"", explains Iain Rudkin, the Arctic Operations Manager for the British Antarctic Survey.
Efforts to mitigate their own environmental impacts are a high priority according to Geir Gotaas, leader of the Norwegian Polar Institute at the base.
Scientists are careful to collaborate to avoid any duplicated research. The teams on the base share data and boat rides to collect Arctic specimens and are planning to transition to electric snowmobiles – although there are challenges. ""In the field researchers typically cover long distances and bring a lot of heavy equipment, and EV snowmobiles aren't up to the task – yet,"" says Gotaas.
And, while protecting the rare ecosystem is enshrined in the Svalbard Treaty, the carbon footprint must also be limited so the science itself is not derailed.
""It's very important to limit our carbon footprint when we are working in such a unique environment"", Maturilli says. She explains that if a car or engine snowmobile visits the atmospheric lab, the data for these periods is not usable due to the carbon increases. (Read more about why Ny-Ålesund is the town with the cleanest air in the world.)
""Worsened battery performance in cold conditions and any projects which involve sea or diving activities are very difficult because the logistics use up many resources,"" she adds. ""We co-ordinate within the international community of climate researchers, each doing a puzzle piece to make sure we optimise activities so there's benefits for all"".
The site has enabled long-term research in the high Arctic and unique collaboration between countries and disciplines. The scientists share equipment – everything from meteorologic balloons to second hand winter clothing.
The Korean Polar Institute's team is one such example of cross-country collaboration. The team used results from a project carried out by a German-Nordic partnership. The work led to the Korean team publishing a paper about how Arctic ecosystems operate during the dark.
Yoo Kyung Lee from the Korean Polar Institute says she also minimises her carbon footprint at the station by freeze-drying her plant samples to transport back to South Korea for further energy-intensive experiments. The frozen samples show the multi-generational changes in Svalbard's plant life. From the base, she monitors changes in the plants – creating DNA markers to distinguish populations and later sequences their genomes so she can study their adaptations to the changing climate.
In addition the Norwegian and Italian bases are collaborating in the Ice Memory operation, collecting cores to preserve these rich records before they disappear. The cores are sampled as twins, one being used for research and the other sent for preservation meaning that future generations of scientists can access high-quality cores to study the environmental conditions of our planet long after glaciers may have disappeared due to global warming.
At the busiest times for conducting research in the summer when the sun never sets, the population still remains less than 200, with food and waste strictly managed. The researchers eat the same meals as each otherin only one room to limit the container ship deliveries and the waste generated is sorted in 10 to 15 fractions – fractions is the term for waste categories such as food, cardboard, glass – and shipped to the Norwegian mainland for recycling
The majority of the produce comes from Norwegian wholesale suppliers and is imported from the mainland as there is no agricultural produce in Svalbard. Gotaas says they try to keep food waste at a minimum.
""The most important step is quite simple; only prepare the amount of food needed to feed the number of people in Ny-Ålesund at any given time,"" he explains.
Leftovers are typically served as part of lunch the following day and whatever is left of food waste is shipped to the Norwegian mainland for composting and regular waste handling.
While undertaking their projects, scientists regularly receive spot check visits when their power usage is scrutinised – with use of electronic devices limited to conserve electricity. The power station which provides electricity and hot water still runs on diesel, although heat exchangers have been installed to extract as much heat and energy as possible from the power generator exhausts. Smaller measures are also implemented, such as installing more efficient ventilation systems in the labs, switching from regular light bulbs to LED lights, having motion sensors to switch off lights automatically, and lowering of the temperature in rooms that are not being used.
Research instruments themselves are meticulously tracked across this remote landscape – each registered in a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer – or collection of geographic data – with every project's tools mapped and constantly updated. The general rule is that all projects should have a start and end date so that instruments no longer active are quickly collected, explains Gotaas. Because of the need to provide environmental data of the highest quality possible, Geir says it is in ""everyone's interest to keep the local carbon footprint at a minimum to avoid any disturbance to the sensitive measurements"".
The stations themselves are as vulnerable as the ecosystem. The buildings, which function as both living quarters and laboratories were built as early as 1910, though to the 1960s.
Improving insulation is a step typically taken when renovating the old buildings. But since many of the oldest buildings in Ny-Ålesund are protected as cultural heritage, there are limits to what changes can be made. So, the scientists focus on improving efficiency and have installed the heat exchangers for this purpose.
But due to the melting permafrost, the stations are shifting and tilting with doors no longer fitting their frames, and pools of water are rotting their wooden foundations. To tackle this problem, the teams devised an engineering method to move the stations using car jacks to raise and then lower the buildings on new steel girded frames. In some cases engineers must drill 50m (164ft) deep into the bedrock and reinforce concrete pillars which have replaced the original wooden supports.
Carbon Count
The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.
When the station was first built, the permafrost was so stable that this wasn't necessary, but with the changes from global warming over the last decades causing thawing permafrost several of the old buildings have extensive damages as the structural integrity has been compromised. Geir says that inserting steel pillars into the bedrock will ""prevent damages from occurring, and reduce the need for expensive maintenance and reparations"".
Two or three people can pull the entire building off its foundations, simply cut its electricity for half an hour and then reconnect it with none of the ongoing lab research compromised. With the Italian station already moved, the UK station is next in line in spring.
Svalbard is the fastest warming place in the world, and even within the Arctic. Leaving as little trace as possible is a challenge for the whole Ny-Ålesund community. Now, not only the results but the research itself is being outpaced by the climate crisis as it becomes more seasonally dependent.
Until recently, scientists hoping to study the sea ice in the Arctic could research at the station but the presence of sea ice can no longer be guaranteed. ""Normally now it is too warm and turbulent for the sea ice so we've had to turn down some projects otherwise the scientists could lose their funding,"" explains Rudkin.
More like this:
• An icy plunge: Diving under sea ice for science
• The race to study Antarctica before it melts
• The astronauts of the underworld
The work that takes place on the research base informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that the Arctic is likely to be nearly ice-free in the summer before 2050, with Arctic sea ice cover already at its lowest level since at least 1850. And if scientists cannot research this sea ice, Rudkin worries about what will be lost to science.
""It's incredibly sad. Over 15 years, I've seen it change too much. [The] mind-blowing scenery gets under your skin and you fall in love with it. But I have two small kids and the thought of what world I'm leaving behind for them is always on my mind,"" Rudkin says.
""In daily life I meet people who ask me if the Arctic is actually changing,"" says Rudkin. ""I wish they could see how much its lost so quickly. We always hope our science gets fed into policy so we could still change the future.""

Wildfire home scare has owners fearing about future,A mild winter followed by spring droughts has made this year particularly bad for wildfires in Wales.,12 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9veeypj93eo,"A couple who watched in fear as a wildfire raced down a mountainside towards their home have said they worry the threat could get worse with climate change.
Fire crews prevented the flames from reaching Alison and Ian Jones' house backing onto the mountain above Treorchy in Rhondda Cynon Taf last month, but the close call has left them wondering how bad it could get.
""The fires in Los Angeles and Spain have been horrendous,"" Ian said. ""We're not on that scale, but who knows what's coming?""
Prof Stefan Doerr, head of Swansea University's Centre for Wildfire Research (CWR), said milder weather in the coming decades means ""more fires and longer fire seasons"".
A mild winter allowing for more foliage growth followed by spring droughts has made this year particularly bad for wildfires, he added.
Firefighters have had to hold back raging wildfires from properties across Wales this week, with one Ceredigion councillor describing firefighters as being ""on their knees"".
Mr Jones said they were ""concerned every year"" because of mountain fires coming down to the edge of Treorchy, but a blaze on 21 March ""got a little bit close to the house"".
His biggest fear, he said, was for the safety of the firefighters.
""They put their lives on the line every time they go up there,"" said Mr Jones, who decided to fell a tree close his roof after the fire.
""I don't know where the solution is, but we've been here 20-odd years and we have had fires [in the area] every year.""
His wife Alison, who was home alone when the flames came close, said she has trust in the system.
""Most of the firemen know the area so well and they know how to manage it.""
Wildfires also make crews less able to respond to a property fire or a road crash.
But the workload and danger for fires crews seems to be getting worse.
With no major wildfires in Wales last year, Prof Doerr said the fields and mountains have had ""a lot of vegetation growth"".
Together with the spring drought it ""makes things pretty bad"" this year, he added.
Under the current climate change models for Wales, milder winters will mean more foliage to burn, followed by worsening spring droughts.
""Both are likely to become more extreme and these will make it more likely that we'll have more fires and longer fire seasons,"" he said.
Prof Doerr said a fire risk website, developed with South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, lets people check conditions in their area.
But people are more worried about the impact of fires on wildlife than themselves, according to a CWR survey.
""People tend to be complacent because they think the fire service has things under control,"" said Rhigos photographer Garan Thomas.
The 27-year-old said he feared a big fire could spread to properties because Rhigos is surrounded by fields.
""My house backs on a rugby pitch and a farm is close, so who is to say the fires wouldn't get in the back garden?""
Smoke from a Rhigos mountain fire hung over the town for more than a week in 2023.
""You wonder if there's enough [firefighting] equipment for this and if South Wales fire service is big enough to cope,"" he said.
This fire season is different, Mr Thomas added, with fires starting in places not seen before.
""Everyone expects a field or a mountain fire, but the frequency of them this year and the different locations is a bit concerning.""
Farmers have been setting controlled fires in the late winter and spring for generations, said Sian Jones, 64, from Crymych in Pembrokeshire.
""When the mountains are plastered in gorse you have cases like California with people going for a picnic and chucking glass and then you've got a problem,"" she said.
She said controlling the gorse is crucial to avoid wildfires.
""Nothing for me is more beautiful than seeing the controlled fires,"" she added.
But one such fire this year in the Preseli Hills, near the village of Brynberian, got out of control in high winds.
In the south Wales valleys most of the hills above towns like Treorchy are managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), not farmers.
NRW said the majority of land it manages in the area is forest plantations.
""Most of these fires begin on open ground and can quickly spread into forests, where fuel loads increase the intensity and impact of the fire,"" a spokesperson said.
""In the south Wales valleys, we've developed wildfire risk management plans for our high-risk areas and take practical action, such as putting in fuel breaks where vegetation is removed to slow down or stop the spread of wildfires.”
NRW said climate change was a ""key factor"" in the increasing risk of wildfires.
""We are adapting our fire risk management to respond to this – but partnership and public support are essential,"" it said.
The fire services, local authorities, public services boards and community groups work to ""assess and reduce wildfire risk through prevention, response, and education,"" NRW added."
The benefits of cleaning with vinegar,"Katarina Zimmer put vinegar to the test as a cleaning product and discovered a wide range of benefits, for people and the planet.",24 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250423-is-vinegar-safer-and-more-sustainable-than-other-cleaning-products,"Katarina Zimmer put vinegar to the test as a cleaning product and discovered a wide range of benefits, for people and the planet.
A few months ago in my new Berlin apartment, my toilet and I were at war. No amount of scrubbing or toilet cleaner would evict the limescale coating inside. Frustrated, I turned to Google and stumbled across a page recommending vinegar – something that the previous inhabitant had left behind in abundance. After dropping two tablespoons full of ""Essigessenz"" – essentially concentrated vinegar – into the toilet and waiting for half an hour, I scrubbed and the limescale came off in a moment.
Since then, I've enthusiastically used vinegar to rid my world of limescale. I've found it even more effective than my regular kitchen spray cleaner for getting my sink sparkling. That includes the faucet, which I wrapped in a vinegar-soaked kitchen tissue – whereas my regular cleaning spray dribbled off. And rather than having to buy special tablets to clean my limescale-smothered glass kettle, I simply poured two tablespoons of concentrated vinegar inside and boiled it. As the limescale crackled off, it made a satisfying sizzling sound.
I wondered if vinegar had other advantages. Did it also kill off bacteria and other germs? And, importantly, was this simple, natural product better for the environment and for my health than regular cleaning products?
The internet is full of sustainability influencers and green cleaning blogs that advertise vinegar as a jack-of-all-trades and a safer and ""greener"" alternative to ""toxic"" cleaning products. These claims make sense on the surface; vinegar is after all just fermented alcohol and has long been used as a food preservative, in salad dressings, as well as a household cleaner – but I wanted evidence. After interviewing three experts, I learned that while some of these claims are true, the benefits of vinegar depend a lot on how it's used and the kind of grime you're trying to get rid of.
Reassuringly, Eric Beckman, a chemical engineer and emeritus professor at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, told me that the best cleaning use for acetic acid – the main component of vinegar – is exactly what I had been using it for: as a descaler. Limescale – and rust, for that matter – consists of certain ions that dissolve more easily in acidic fluids like vinegar, he says. Beckman uses vinegar himself to get limescale off mirrors, while the microbiologist Dirk Bockmühl of Germany's Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences prefers using lemon juice, which contains citric acid, which he says is a more effective descaler and smells better. (Read more about why vinegar is such an effective cleaner.)
That said, vinegar doesn't work on everything. Beckman says that soap does a better job at removing oily films on dishes, while baking soda is effective against processed oils that have stuck onto surfaces while cooking. (Read more about whether baking soda is environmentally friendly).
However, Beckman expresses exasperation about a popular remedy of mixing vinegar together with baking soda. The mixture is chemically quite useless, he says, as the acid of vinegar and the base of baking soda effectively cancel each other out. ""I use both, but not together,"" says Beckman. ""Together, they give you nothing.""
And while vinegar is often touted as a powerful antimicrobial, Bockmühl says, the truth is more nuanced. In a 2020 study, Bockmühl and his colleagues put vinegar to the test against a selection of disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi. While many internet recommendations suggest adding a dash of vinegar into a bucket of water for cleaning, Bockmühl found that its anti-microbial effects only kick in at an acetic acid concentration of 5% – its concentration in pure vinegar. And it was only fully effective at distilled concentrations of 10%  – to which the researchers added a dash of citric acid – in killing off five common bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a mould, a yeast and a weakened strain of the vaccinia virus. Other studies have found that similar concentrations also work against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
But even these concentrations didn't work against the MRSA bacterium, an especially stubborn strain of Staphylococcus aureus that's resistant to certain antibiotics, while countless bacteria remain untested. Many bacteria – including the ones that ferment alcohol into vinegar – thrive in acids, Beckman adds: ""Then they'll be like, 'ooh, yay, vinegar.'"" Some moulds, too, are resistant to acetic acid while some viruses – like norovirus – might be, too, Bockmühl suspects. Beckman says that soaps are more effective against bacteria, while standard disinfectants work better against viruses and moulds. Harsh treatments like bleach will definitely kill everything, Beckman says – although bleach can be unsafe if used incorrectly.
Bockmühl stresses that, even for the germs that vinegar does kill, a relatively high concentration is needed. The concentration won't be adequate ""if you just put a teaspoon of vinegar into your cleaning solution"", Bockmühl says.
However, the higher the dose of acetic acid, the more irritating it can be on the skin, he adds. It is harmful if it gets into your eyes. Surfaces can suffer, too: vinegar corrodes natural stone and metals like copper, bronze and brass, according to the Italian chemist Dario Bressanini's book The Science of Cleaning. And in dishwashers or washing machines, it can harm the rubber gaskets used to seal them, while it could also damage coffee machines and strip away the coating on tiles and grout, Bressanini writes. But Bockmühl assures me that it's fine to use vinegar on glass and ceramic surfaces – like my toilet – and stainless steel sinks.
The trouble that Bockmühl sees with using homemade cleaning products is that they don't come with instructions or safety recommendations. ""They might be safe if you know what you're doing,"" he says, ""but there are a lot of really stupid and absurd recommendations on the internet"".

• Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025
To learn more about how the health risks of vinegar compare with those of conventional cleaners, I called up Nicola Carslaw, professor of indoor air chemistry at the University of York in the UK. Her concern is how cleaners disrupt the air in our homes and buildings. It's known that professional domestic cleaners tend to have higher rates of asthma than other occupational groups, although it's proven difficult to pin that on any single product or ingredient.
In a recent study, Carslaw and her colleagues tested 23 different cleaning products including dishwasher fluid, washing up liquid and spray products, and found that many of them released volatile chemical compounds (VOCs). Some of these compounds, like terpenes, are often added to give pleasant aromas, such as lavender or pine oil, but they're highly reactive in the atmosphere. Terpenes for instance, easily react with ozone in the air, creating miniscule particles. In general, inhaling particles of this size has been linked to lung and heart disease.
""Your nose is a really good filter for the big particles, but the smaller ones can get all the way into your lungs [and] into the bloodstream,"" Carslaw says. Interestingly, in her study she found that cleaning products marketed as ""natural"" or ""green"" didn't seem any healthier in this regard. ""The natural/green ones had as many, if not more VOCs as the standard cleaners, and in many cases they were more reactive,"" she says.
But vinegar, by contrast, only consists of water and acetic acid (and a few other substances that make the difference between red and wine vinegar, for instance). As such, ""it's just not going to be chemically reactive in the same way"", Carslaw says. Another advantage of vinegar is that it's usually applied on a cloth to wipe surfaces rather than used as a spray, Carslaw adds. Research shows that cleaning products applied in spray form have more harmful effects on the respiratory system than liquids and wipes. (Read more about the health risks associated with cleaning products in Jessica Bradley's story).
""When you spray something, you're turning the chemical into a form that's much easier to breathe [in] than if you have the liquid,"" Carslaw says. That said, she always advises gloves when there's risk of skin contact, good ventilation and avoiding excessive cleaning, whatever product is used. (Read more about whether we're cleaning too much for our own good).
This all left me with one remaining question: is using vinegar more environmentally friendly than conventional cleaners?
That's a hard question to answer, says Beckman. Ideally, there would be life cycle analyses for cleaning products which track impacts from cradle to grave, tracing each ingredient back to its source, how it's produced, transported, packaged and eventually disposed of. But very few companies do that thoroughly, even if they do brand their products as ""green"", Beckman says.
""But I will say this about vinegar. [Its] strength is its simplicity,"" Beckman says. Conventional cleaners can consist of more than a dozen different ingredients, many of them industrially manufactured in energy-consuming processes, he says. Acetic acid is born through the natural, yeast-driven fermentation of alcohol, which itself comes from the natural fermentation of sugar. The biggest environmental impact of vinegar-making is where the sugar came from – whether it's grapes, apples, grains, potatoes, or rice – which are largely renewable resources. Bockmühl cautions that this only applies to naturally fermented vinegars, the ones typically sold as food products; there are also synthetic vinegars which are derived from fossil fuels, meaning they come with all the environmentally harmful impacts of oil and gas extraction.
Even at the very end of its life, vinegar has little impact. While many ingredients in soaps are tough molecules and don't easily biodegrade, sometimes continuing to kill organisms once they're in the environment, vinegar quickly breaks down, Beckman says. ""Vinegar passes muster on any sustainability scale because it's simple and it's degradable,"" he says.
After discovering all of this, I felt even better about using vinegar. I probably won't rely on it for ridding my surfaces of germs, but I'll keep using it to remove limescale and look forward to trying it out on the next rusty item I find. I'm happy to put up with the smell, knowing that I'm using a sustainable product that's likely better for my health.

Jenkyns: fracking would save money for taxpayers,The new mayor for Greater Lincolnshire says she will be meeting with a fracking company.,4 May 2025,Lincolnshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9112nd8vo,"The new mayor of Lincolnshire has said she will be meeting with a fracking company to discuss a business case to extract gas from underground in the county.
Dame Andrea Jenkyns said the move would ""really save money for the Lincolnshire taxpayers"".
She was speaking on the BBC's Politics North show after winning the contest to become the first mayor of Greater Lincolnshire on Thursday. Her party, Reform UK, will also take over the running of the county council from the Conservatives.
In response, the government said it planned to ban fracking to protect current and future generations and ""the biggest risk"" to energy security was ""staying dependent on fossil fuel markets"".
Dame Andrea was questioned about her position regarding Reform UK's plans to scrap the country's net zero target and impose a windfall tax on green energy companies.
Tim Iredale, the BBC's political editor for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, put it to the mayor that this could cost jobs around the Humber estuary.
Dame Andrea said the three main parties had a ""homogenized view"" on net zero, and that there had been no scrutiny of the plans.
""I will be meeting with a fracking company after the gas find, and put a business argument [forward],"" she added. ""We should be doing that. That will really save money for the Lincolnshire taxpayers.""
In February, a company claimed there was enough gas under an area near Gainsborough to supply the country's energy needs for seven years. However, opponents insist fracking – a technique used to capture a type of gas found deep underground in shale rock – risks water, air and noise pollution.
A government spokesperson told the BBC that it intended to ""ban fracking for good and make Britain a clean energy superpower"".
""Only by sprinting to clean power by 2030 can the UK take back control of its energy and protect consumers from spiralling energy costs,"" the spokesperson added.
The Federation of Small Businesses in Lincolnshire has also warned that the net zero agenda should not be ""thrown out with the bathwater"" because it offered ""enormous economic opportunity"" in the county.
Keane Duncan, a Conservative councillor and cabinet member for north Yorkshire, and Rachel Maskel, the Labour MP for York, appeared on the programme alongside Dame Andrea.
Duncan said a windfall tax on energy would cost jobs and sacrifice investment. ""It will also mean that people's energy bills are going to be higher,""  he added.
Maskel said it was time to ""wake up to the climate challenges"" and argued that ""the real investment in growth and opportunity for our region sits in the energy sector"".
Dame Andrea was also asked on the programme about Reform UK's pledge to scrap diversity officers from local authorities.
Nigel Farage, the leader of the party, has said getting rid of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) officers is at the top of their agenda.
However, when asked by the BBC about such roles, Lincolnshire County Council said it did not have any staff doing those kinds of jobs.
Dame Andrea claimed the diversity roles had been ""rebranded now as mentors"".
""I think there's lots of these hidden roles, diversity hidden roles, which we need to uncover,"" she said.
""I'm a meritocrat, and I think this diversity extreme inclusion, it can actually divide people more.
""I'm neurodiverse myself, My son is, it's about creating the right conditions to make sure that people are attracted to these jobs.
""I just want competent people. So I think that we need to do away with roles like this.""
Councillor Judith Matthews, of North Lincolnshire Council, appeared live on the programme. She was asked what she wanted Jenkyns to achieve in her role.
The Labour councillor said: ""She needs to help the disabled people get back into work that have a lot of skills. And that can be done by working in collaboration with disability groups so that everybody has a fair chance at a good job.""

Blue Origin crew safely back on Earth after all-female space flight,Six women - including pop star Katy Perry - blasted off into space as part of an all-women suborbital mission,14 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8e5gq8ljo,"Pop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket.
The singer was joined by Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"".
After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt ""super connected to life"" and ""so connected to love"".
The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.
Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.
The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).
The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas.
Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them.
Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren Sánchez, the first to disembark.
""I'm so proud of this crew,"" she said tearfully. ""I can't put it into words.""
She paused, before adding: ""I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.""
""Earth looked so quiet,"" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. ""It was quiet, but really alive.""
Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.
Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground.
""I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,"" she said.
The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: ""I went to space.""
A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground.
Speaking from the viewing platform, Khloé Kardashian said: ""I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.""
""Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars—and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,""​ she added.
Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.
""I mean, for her—whew—anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,"" she said.
The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.
The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6.
Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions.
The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.
But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.
""A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,"" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.
""These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,"" he added. ""We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.
""Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.""
The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.
Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: ""A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'""
But: ""There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'""
Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: ""The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.""
However she noted the all-women team might ""change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.""
""Socially, they might have had some impact"", she said.
In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.
""I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,"" said Gayle King.
She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.
Lauren Sánchez said she had got ""fired up"" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who ""put their heart and soul into"" the missions.
Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.
Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (£114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat—underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.
Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems.
The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.
According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.
Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.
Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.
The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.
Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible.
Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: ""Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,"" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.
Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer.
On its web page under the title ""Protecting our Planet"" Blue Origin claims: ""During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.""
However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere.
""It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,"" she says.
Experts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases.
The high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority.
Critics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking ""there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,"" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends.

"Residents nervous about flood risk, says MP",George Freeman calls on the government to compel housebuilders to provide adequate drainage.,20 mins ago,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071gp17nxyo,"An MP said constituents in his county were increasingly ""nervous and worried"" about inland flooding and appealed to the government to take action.
George Freeman, the Conservative MP for Mid Norfolk, told a debate in Parliament that 1,000 properties in the county have been flooded in the past 18 months ""with sewage washing between houses"".
He called for housebuilders to be compelled to provide adequate drainage and for more central funding for drainage boards, which manage water levels in inland areas.
Emma Hardy, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for water and flooding, said she took the concerns ""very seriously"" and a record amount of money was  going into flood prevention.
Freeman added that 22 villages in his constituency have suffered serious flooding in the past five years.

Freeman told MPs internal flooding was no longer a marginal issue in places such as Norfolk, as a combination of climate change and housebuilding had caused it to occur in places where it had not been seen five or six years ago.
""The patient people of Mid Norfolk are getting really impatient with this,"" he said.
""On behalf of all those people who are very nervous and worried - one constituent was so worried about this that they took their own life - I urge the minister to be bold and brave,"" he added.
Mr Freeman is working on a parliamentary bill to give homeowners more protection from flooding.
""The only way to make [developers] take this seriously is to say, 'Look if you build and within five or ten years there is significant flooding that never used to happen you're going to be on the hook for upgrading the drains… and doing the repair work'.
""We have to make the directors of those companies say, ""I think we'd better upgrade, we'd better do the investment upfront,"" he said.
Freeman was supported by Steff Aquarone, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk, who said: ""We need more homes… but although North Norfolk Council does an excellent job pushing developers as hard as it can, it needs the government to provide it with the legislative teeth to achieve more.""
Terry Jermy, the Labour MP for South West Norfolk, called for more funding for internal drainage boards, which he said were struggling with old equipment while their pumps use more expensive electricity.
""For every pound that King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council collects in council tax, 43p now goes to internal drawing board levies, which is completely unsustainable,"" he said
In February the government committed £2.65bn over two years for flood and coastal erosion risk management, which included the repair and maintenance of existing infrastructure.
Some of the funding has been allocated to Norfolk, as well as funding for internal drainage boards was increased by £16m.
Hardy told the debate the government was ""committed to building the homes that the country needs, while maintaining the highest levels of flood protection"".
""Inappropriate development should be avoided and where no suitable sites are available developers should ensure development is appropriately flood resilient and resistant,"" she added.
The number of MPs in this debate showed that flooding has become a major concern in many parts of the country.
Freeman believed the solution lied within giving local councils and other bodies more power and money to deal with flooding pinch points.
The government has strengthened the planning rules when it comes to flood risk and it said it would consider whether further changes were needed.
Hardy said she was listening to the concerns of MPs.

Town ferry to return 'by summer if not before',The passenger ferry service connecting West Lynn and King's Lynn has been suspended since January.,7 days ago,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v9vk2nzklo,"A plan has been devised to get a suspended ferry service back up and running by the summer.
West Norfolk Borough Council, Norfolk County Council and the operators of the West Lynn ferry have agreed on steps to repair the boat's landing site.
Residents said it had taken too long to get to this point and criticised the lack of progress updates on its return to service.
West Norfolk Borough Council said they had been grappling with a ""significant number of technical challenges associated with this work.""
About 400 people a week used the service, which connected West Lynn to King's Lynn, before its closure in January.
Structural issues including cracked concrete steps and a damaged jetty on the West Lynn side of the river were identified during scheduled maintenance work on 14 January.
West Lynn residents Alison Fletcher and Karen Champion want the ferry back as soon as possible.
Ms Champion said: ""It is really quite outrageous.
""There's nothing here to tell people they will not be getting the ferry.
""There were 40 pilgrims left without a way to get over to the other side to their service at Easter.""
Ms Fletcher pointed out that the ferry reduced congestion in the town by encouraging active travel.
""The old town and the river is a real tourist attraction,"" she said.
She is concerned visitors will be put off travelling when the ferry is not operating.
Councillor Michael De Whalley, cabinet member for climate change and biodiversity at the borough council, said: ""We continued to work together to overcome a number of technical and operational issues, and to design and fund a solution that would allow the ferry to reopen.
""We now have all the jigsaw pieces in place to move forward.
""Whilst it is not yet possible to give an exact date, it is reasonable to say that we hope it can open in the summer, if not sooner.""
He said that interim repairs to the landing would be carried out to allow the service to restart.
The borough council voted in February to support medium term improvements to the infrastructure of up to £150,000, to help towards design options and costs for the next stage that would secure a sustainable, long term future for the ferry.
Conservative MP for North West Norfolk, James Wild, has also been pushing for the ferry to reopen.
""Many constituents have contacted me since it stopped in January and I've raised it regularly with the local councils and I am grateful for their efforts alongside the harbour master, the Conservancy Board, and others,"" he said.
""I will also work with them on longer term plans for the service.""

Fruit and veg plots planned for Civic Hall garden,Plans to grow food in the garden were first suggested last September but are now being considered.,12 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75d322v292o,"Strawberries, chillies and peppers could be grown outside a council building to increase access to fresh food.
The plans to grow vegetables and fruit in the flower beds outside Leeds Civic Hall in Millennium Square are being drawn up by councillors after the suggestion was made last September.
Mohammed Rafique, executive member for environment, said the council gardening team had been working on planting options for the site, which would be implemented this spring.
He said: ""The plans include consideration of edible planting, including strawberries chillies and peppers, as well as other options including biodiversity and climate adaptation, with due consideration to sustainability.""
The beds stood unplanted over the winter as soil maintenance work was carried out.
Headingley and Hyde Park councillor Tim Goodall welcomed Mr Rafique's statement.
He told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""I'm glad to see that the council's gardening team are considering edible planting and encouraging biodiversity in the flowerbeds outside the Civic Hall.
""It's also good to see they are considering climate adaptation and sustainability.
""As it's such a central and visible site, this would be great for encouraging even more planting initiatives like this across the city.""
The council said it encouraged edible planting elsewhere through its support for community groups and allotments.

'Warm weather means strawberries are Easter ready',A Chichester-based strawberry grower says it has produced 50 tonnes more fruit than last year.,14 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjl9xv1jl3o,"A Sussex strawberry grower says three weeks of sunshine has helped to produce a bumper crop of fruit which will be in supermarkets in time for Easter.
The Summer Berry Company, based in Colworth near Chichester, says recent warmer weather has helped it increase its production to 200 tonnes – 50 tonnes more than by the same time las year.
Jack Darnes, the company's commercial director, says he is ""really excited"" about the boost, with plants producing ""lush-sweet tasting fruit"".
Tesco berry buyer Callum Baker said that the growth burst would mean an estimated 500,000 punnets of strawberries arriving at its stores in East and West Sussex.
Mr Darnes added: ""Strawberry plants love the English spring and summer climate; not too hot, not too cold with warm days and cool nights. This is why we produce the best strawberries in the world.""
Mr Baker said: ""The arrival in stores of the first spring-grown British strawberries of the year creates a feel-good factor because it signifies the start of the UK fruit season and that summer is on the way.
""But their availability also brings a cheer from shoppers because British-grown strawberries are considered to be the best in the world because of our climate.
""Strawberries taste naturally sweeter when ripened in periods of sunny weather because it boosts their natural sugars.""
Dry conditions also enhance the flavour of the strawberries, making them firmer and more flavourful, he said.

Thieves target charity twice in two weeks,'Vital' items used for repair cafés have been stolen from Vision 21.,25 Apr 2025,Gloucestershire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8kd7n7e6yo,"A sustainability charity is appealing for donations after two break-ins in as many weeks.
Vision 21's van was broken into overnight on 5 April. Thieves also targeted the charity's Reclaim furniture shop on Lansdown Industrial Estate, Cheltenham, in the early hours of 14 April, and stole a card reader, a sewing machine, tools and two bikes.
James Cooke, CEO, said: ""This is a real blow to our small team and volunteers who work tirelessly to promote a more sustainable Cheltenham. But we're determined to keep going, and we're asking the community to stand with us.""

Students tackle 'massive problem' of flooding,"Students study the impact of flooding, aiming to ""make a difference for future generations"".",24 Apr 2025,Berkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvr8dmgj1mo,"Students at the University of Reading's Department of Geography and Environmental Science are learning how to help minimise the damage from future flooding events.
Professor of Hydrology, Hannah Cloke said flooding was ""a massive problem to tackle"".
""We have students from all kinds of backgrounds. We have meteorologists from all over the world coming here to study"" she said.
The students have also been hearing from Mary Long-Dhonau who has been campaigning and providing advice for those affected by flooding for 25 years.
She told the students that flood victims were, on average, out of their homes for nine months.
She said: ""The recovery from the flood is far worse than the flood itself, because you suddenly have to become a project manager of a building site.
""There are cheaper solutions to minimising the impact of flooding... you can lift furniture up all by yourself using planks of wood, decorator's trestles for your sofas, aluminium tape will do 100 air bricks,"" she added.
Prof Cloke said: ""We can see the fingerprints of climate change in these floods that we're experiencing now.
""We have to stop burning fossil fuels, but we also have to adapt. We have to adapt our homes, we have to adapt our businesses"".
One of the students said: ""I think we have a group of young people who are very solution-driven - focused on trying to make a difference for the future generations because I think it's going to maybe affect the generation after us.""
Another said she wanted to study a masters in risk analysis and mitigation so she can ""help companies to start to look at not only their global impacts but how these impact will then impact them as well"".
Ms Long-Dhonau said: ""One day soon it won't be property flood resilience, it won't be recoverability, it'll be retreat - because flooding will be so bad and so regular and so prolonged that you won't be able to replace those houses or repair them.""

Why Scotland could be hardest hit by RTS meter switch off,"Nearly 135,000 Scottish homes are still waiting for an equipment upgrade ahead of the 30 June deadline.",1 May 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3zp820g3o,"A worrying deadline is looming for nearly 135,000 Scottish homes that have old-style RTS electricity meters installed.
From 30 June, the radio signal that controls them will start to be switched off - with a risk customers could be left without heating and hot water.
Another scenario is that heating could start running all the time and customers could see their bills soar.
Energy suppliers are racing against the clock to replace the old equipment.
But meeting the deadline is a huge challenge, particularly in Scotland which accounts for a third of the total number of RTS meters in the UK still waiting to be upgraded.
RTS stands for Radio Teleswitch Service - a system dating back to the 1980s that uses a radio signal to tell meters to switch between different electricity price rates.
It uses the longwave radio frequency, which is becoming obsolete, and the equipment that generates the signal is due to be switched off this summer.
Most households, including those with older meters, will be unaffected.
But homes that use electric storage heaters or pay different electricity rates at different times of the day are more likely to have RTS equipment fitted.
Figures obtained by BBC Scotland News suggest by the end of April there were about 432,000 RTS meters still to be replaced in the UK - with nearly 135,000 located in Scottish properties.
The reason for the disproportionate number in Scotland is partly due to geography.
With a large rural population in areas like the Highlands and Islands, many households are off the mains gas grid and therefore more likely to use electricity for hot water and heating.
Urban areas are also affected because Scottish energy suppliers were pro-active in encouraging use of storage heaters in the late 20th Century, promoting cheaper tariffs such as Economy 7 or Economy 10.
Storage heaters were also seen as a good option for replacing open fires in local authority or social housing. Many of these homes are now privately-owned.
About half of the meters waiting to be replaced are believed to be in the Highlands and Islands, but around 20,000 are thought to be in Glasgow.
Energy suppliers have been writing to customers, urging them to make an appointment to get their RTS meters replaced with a smart meter.
But the rate of replacement appears to be way behind what is required to meet the 30 June deadline when the signal is switched off.
In September, there were about 175,000 RTS meters waiting to be replaced in Scotland and since then that figure has fallen by about 40,000 - a replacement rate of under 6,000 per month.
Meeting the 30 June deadline would require a 12-fold increase in the number of replacements being carried out.
The issue was debated at Westminster in early April when UK energy minister Miatta Fahnbulleh said the replacement rate was ""not acceptable"".
However, she said that suppliers were promising a ""spring sprint"" to try to meet the deadline in Scotland.
A number of customers have contacted BBC Scotland to report they have had difficulties arranging meter replacement appointments.
Scottish Power said 80% of its replacements had either been completed or scheduled but that 20% of affected customers did not yet have an appointment.
The firm pointed out that the signal switch-off was phased and would not end completely until September.
The UK government said it was demanding that suppliers increase the pace of replacements and that they ensure no-one loses heating or hot water.
The SNP has called for the 30 June switch-off date to be delayed, or for a guarantee of compensation if customers face increased costs.
Climate minister Alasdair Allan said the Scottish government was doing everything it could, ""within our limited devolved powers"" to mitigate the impact.
He said: ""This is a reserved issue and we need suppliers, the UK government and Ofgem to demonstrate the leadership required to meet the scale of the challenge.""
Some - but not all - RTS systems have a separate box near the electricity meter with the words ""radio teleswitch"" or ""radio telemeter"".
If you pay a different tariff for electricity at different times of the day - and the switching occurs automatically - this is an indication you may be affected.
Electricity tariffs named ""Comfort Plus"" and ""Total Heat Total Control"" are linked with RTS meters.
Homes with electric storage and water heaters are more likely to use the equipment.
If in doubt, the best advice is to contact your electricity supplier.
Suppliers should replace the old RTS meters free of charge.
But there might be charges if the meter needs to be moved or wiring replaced. Suppliers should inform customers if this is the case.
Customers are warned to be wary of people offering to replace meters for a fee, in case they are scammers.
Smart meters can work in a similar way to the old-style meters by providing automated switching between peak and off-peak rates.
They should also be able to turn hot water systems off and on.
However, customers will have to move onto a new smart meter tariff which could involve changes such as different off-peak times.
Orkney MP Alistair Carmichael has reported complaints from constituents who say the cheapest tariff is no longer available to them after replacements, and that their bills have risen.
The regulator Ofgem is working with suppliers on how to fulfil a pledge that customers should be no worse off as a result of the switchover.
Another issue with smart meters is that they sometimes struggle to work in areas like the Highlands and Islands where there is poor network connectivity.
An alternative in such cases is to have a smart meter which is pre-programmed to switch to different rates at certain times of the day.

Warwickshire vote sees Reform become largest party,Tory leader Izzi Seccombe loses her seat while the vote leaves the council under no overall control.,2 May 2025,Coventry & Warwickshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywqljezd5o,"The Conservatives have lost control of Warwickshire County Council amid a Reform surge seen in several councils across England.
Tory council leader Izzi Seccombe, who had led the council for nearly 12 years, lost her seat to David Curtis, from the Liberal Democrats, and the final tally left the authority under no overall control.
Big gains were seen by both the Liberal Democrat and Green Party groups, while Reform became the largest party on the authority with 23 seats, but was unable to secure a majority.
Liberal Democrats now form the second largest block with 14 seats.
The Conservative group has nine, the Green Party has seven, Labour has three and Whitnash Residents Association has one.
The council previously had a strong Conservative majority, holding 41 of 57 seats
One of the youngest councillors to be elected was George Finch, for Reform, who, at the age of 18, took the Bedworth Central seat, with 1,563 votes.
Judith Falps, from Whitnash Residents Association, who polled 939 votes to edge past Reform in her seat, described the outcome of the local elections as a ""wake-up call"" for major parties.
Liberal Democrat group deputy leader, Sarah Boad, re-elected for Leamington North, said most of Warwickshire's portfolio holders lost their seats and residents were going to get a ""completely new broom"" with a new set of people in charge.
With control of the council now up in the air, Nigel Clarke, chairman of the Warwick and Leamington branch of Reform, said his party was happy to work with the Conservatives at a local level and meetings were already planned.
""We're way past a protest vote,"" he said. ""We're now at a stage where we understand that Britain is broken. We've had 100 years of Labour and Tories. Reform believe in starting again.""
Reform's national leader Nigel Farage, speaking in Durham, said the results marked ""the end of two-party politics"".
Voters told the BBC that priority issues included traffic, climate change, recycling and litter, as well as early years education and social care.
Nuneaton's Labour MP Jodie Gosling defended her party's performance and said it was ""not unusual"" for a government to experience push back.
She added that she saw support for Reform and the Green Party as indicative of the ""disarray of the Conservatives"".
""There are still many families feeling the pinch,"" she said, ""and the legacy we have been left with is going to take time to clean up.""
Graham Curtis, who was a Conversative candidate for Attleborough, said the results reflected the feeling on doorsteps.
""A lot of the Reform votes have come from the Conservatives,"" he said.""There seems to be that local feeling of protest and change.""
The BBC has approached former leader Izzi Seccombe for comment.

Moving on 'bitter sweet' for conservation boss,Manx Wildlife Trust chief executive Leigh Morris reflects on five years leading the organisation.,19 Apr 2025,Isle of Man,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g22kpnx5po,"Moving on from working directly in conservation on the Isle of Man is ""bitter sweet"", the outgoing boss of local organisation has said.
Manx Wildlife Trust (MWT) chief executive Leigh Morris will leave in May to take on the role of Director of International Nature and Climate at the Wildlife Trusts.
Reflecting on his five years in the post he said a key achievement was the expansion of the charity, which had tripled in size of both its team and land holdings.
He said he had ""learnt a huge amount"" about conservation through working on the island because it was a ""wonderful microcosm"", but said he hoped he had ""given a lot too"".
The MWT was also in a ""stronger place"" in terms of its finances, he said,  which had in part been possible through the rise in corporations focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG).
A key project Mr Morris has been instrumental in is the ongoing planting of 30,000 trees at Creg y Cowin as part of a £38m rainforest restoration programme being rolled out by the Wildlife Trusts.
During his time, Mr Morris pushed for MWT to gain a government contract to help deliver an agri-environment scheme, with agriculture taking up about 75% of the land on the island.
He said while the organisation only managed about 0.3% of the land when he joined in January 2020, that had now increased to 1%.
Although there was a ""historic battle"" between farmers and conservationists, the scheme had enabled the charity to work with farmers to ""make things better for nature"", he said.
Mr Morris also organised for a survey of the island's wild wallaby population after realising there was ""no information"" about how many there were on the island.
He said he was ""gobsmacked"" when the count in the Ballaugh Curraghs showed there were 700 wallabies, with the total on the island now estimated to be between 1,200 and 1,500.
He said he hoped the survey meant there was ""enough information"" about the animals on the island to allow for a management plan to be developed.
Other highlights during his time in the role included rolling out an education programme across the island's 32 primary schools, the charity's 50th anniversary celebrations, and MWT receiving the King's Award for voluntary service.
He said the team had done a ""huge amount over the past five years"" and it was a ""good moment to step away"", Mr Morris said.
Praising all those involved in projects across the island he said: ""People are the reason we need conservation and people are the solution to the island being a wonderful showcase of what a biosphere could look like,"" he added.

Efforts made to save one of England's rarest fish,Arctic charr numbers in Windemere in the Lake District are falling and researchers want to know why.,25 Apr 2025,Cumbria,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy63ge60zno,"A research project is aiming to find out why the population of a rare UK fish is declining.
The Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) plans to study the spawning grounds of Arctic charr in Windermere to determine the reason behind the fish's falling numbers.
Although more common in Nordic countries, the Arctic charr is one of the rarest fish in England and its presence in the Lake District contributed to the area becoming a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2017.
Prof Bernd Hänfling, one of the project's researchers, said the fish were a ""keystone species"" in many large, deep UK lakes.
""Their adaptation to cold, clear water makes them highly vulnerable to pollution and rising temperatures,"" he said.
""This project will generate critical evidence to support the conservation of this enigmatic species.""
In England, the Arctic charr is only found in the Lake District, although they also live in Llyn Padarn in Snowdonia, Wales.
The FBA believes climate change, waste water pollution, and non-native species competing for food could be causing their decline in Windermere.
They are related to salmon and trout and require clean gravel beds to lay their eggs.
The FBA said it planned to assess the condition of spawning grounds in the lake and find out whether historical grounds were still being used.
Researcher Steve Thackeray said: ""During this time of great environmental change, Arctic charr, a culturally-important cold-water fish species, have been in dramatic decline.
""By working together under this important project, we can gather vital evidence on this charismatic species, and help guide conservation efforts.""
The FBA is aiming to raise £10,000 to fund its study, with donations doubled via the Green Match Fund until 29 April.

Canada party leaders grilled in election debate on how to tackle Trump,"Frontrunner Mark Carney was tested in Wednesday's French-language debate, the first of two match-ups before the 28 April election.",17 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgx6kl274zo,"The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have been grilled about their response to US President Donald Trump and clashed over energy and housing in their first televised debate of the country's election campaign.
The French-language face-off marked a key moment in the election as it gave leaders a chance to woo voters in the seat-rich province of Quebec.
It was also a big test for Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has a slight lead in the polls, but whose French is the weakest among the federal leaders. He at times struggled to articulate his points on stage.
There is a second debate in English on Thursday, before Canadians vote on 28 April.
On the stage were the four main party candidates: Liberal leader and current Prime Minister Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh.
The debate was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy.
Mr Roy opened the forum saying that Canada's short 36-day federal election had been ""hijacked by Trump"", and asked each leader to outline two campaign promises unrelated to the US or its tariffs.
But soon afterwards, Mr Roy plunged into a question on how each party would handle the trade war with the US, calling it the ""elephant in the room"".
Trump has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars.
The president has also publicly mused about Canada becoming the 51st US state.
Poilievre, of the opposition Conservatives, accused the governing Liberals of weakening the country over the past decade, making Canada more vulnerable to economic threats.
Carney touted his experience as a former central banker for both Canada and the UK, as well as his time in the private sector.
""[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works,"" Carney said.
Singh, of the left-leaning NDP, sought to paint both Poilievre and Carney as the wrong option for Canadians whose jobs may be affected by US tariffs.
""Both will cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires,"" he said.
For Carney, the French-language debate was arguably the first major test of the campaign trail.
A second debate will be held on Thursday night with the contenders speaking in English.
That forum will be more widely watched nationwide, but the stakes were high on Wednesday for Carney's Liberals, which are leading in Quebec where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live.
His French was the weakest on stage, and he often kept his answers brief and sometimes struggled to get his points across in a debate format with opportunities for rapid exchanges.
He also faced the most frequent attacks as the others leaders tried to tie him to the Liberal record of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned last month.
""We are still talking about the same party, the same caucus,"" the Bloc's Blanchet said.
He added: ""It's not because you change the leader that you change your philosophy.""
Carney countered that he had accomplishments despite only being sworn in as PM last month. He had ""just arrived"", he said.
There was a moment of levity when Mr Roy asked the leaders if they were buying fewer US products - like many Canadians are in the face of tariffs - at the grocery store.
Carney had admitted in an interview early this month that he does not do his own groceries when asked if he still buys US strawberries.
Singh and Blanchet both said they bought Canadian berries. Carney said he had given up US wine, while Poilievre said he buys Canadian beef.
Trump was not the only issue on the agenda. The leaders were asked about their plan to address Canada's housing crisis, and how they would balance climate and the economy.
On housing, Poilievre vowed to cut taxes and red tape that he says act as a barrier to home building.
""We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more front doors,"" the Conservative leader said in a jab directed at Carney.
But the two found common ground on energy, saying the country should ramp up its oil and gas production.
Carney said climate remains a priority for his party, adding that he would focus on producing ""low-risk"", ""low-carbon"" oil.
On immigration, there was also wide agreement that Canada must look at its capacity to integrate newcomers and asylum seekers.
Canada has seen a rapid population boom in recent years and social and housing infrastructure has struggled to catch up.
Canadian border officials recently noted an uptick in asylum seekers looking to cross the Quebec-US border as a result of the Trump administration's hardline  immigration policies.
Absent from the debate stage was the Green Party. In a last-minute decision by the debate commission, it was disqualified for failing to meet the criteria by not endorsing candidates in at least 90% of Canada's federal ridings, or constituencies.
The party, which had two MPs in parliament when the election was called, also failed to meet the threshold of at least 4% in national support.
Green Party co-leader Jonathan Pedneault called the commission's decision ""baseless"" and ""undemocratic"".
It wasn't the only change to the debate.
On Tuesday, the start time was officially moved forward by two hours to accommodate an NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes, with a spot in the Stanley Cup play-offs at stake."
Barriers removed from coastal park over access concerns,"The barriers, installed to stop motorcyclists, had also restricted access for disabled visitors.",23 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y85ynk33o,"Barriers designed to prevent motorcyclists from accessing Flintshire Coast Park have been removed as part of a new five-year management plan.
Disability campaigners had said the A-frame barriers at the banks of the River Dee, originally installed to deter anti-social behaviour and protect the environment, had also restricted access for disabled visitors.
Flintshire council is now urging members of the public to report any incidents of nuisance motorcyclists amid concerns the removal could lead to an increase in dangerous behaviour.
The changes come after multiple groups called for the park to fall in line with disability access legislation.
The council has now removed all A-frame barriers in Connah's Quay and the Deeside area and will work in consultation with other landowners along the coast park and North Wales Police to remove more during 2025 and 2026.
Following the removal of the barriers, Sealand councillor Christine Jones called on police to crack down on vandalism at the park – and for visitors to be their eyes and ears.
""We welcome the removal of the A-frame barriers to improve access but please beware it is being abused by motorcyclists going along the cycle paths,"" she said.
""It is a dangerous practice if someone is walking the dog, cycling or jogging and a motorcycle comes up behind you.""
She added: ""It can be extremely frightening.""
Popular with walkers, cyclists and bird-watchers, the park stretches for 25 miles along the shore of the Dee Estuary, from the Welsh and English border to the Irish Sea.
The park's new management plan sets out target areas for improvement and outlines how the park will provide residents and visitors with an improved experience.
This includes a phased approach to raising the profile of the area, enhancing tourism and helping communities and businesses to work sustainably and creatively to improve environmental, economic and social outcomes.
The plans detail a site-specific proposal for eight ""hubs"" along the path with Flint Foreshore to become the central hub and focal point for visitors to explore the park with a proposed new heritage building.
There are also aims to improve protections for natterjack toad populations in Talacre.
Councillor Chris Dolphin, cabinet member for economy, environment and climate, said: ""Our ambition is a Flintshire Coast Park for the benefit of all, celebrating the rich natural habitat of the Dee Estuary and Flintshire coastline.
""The rich Dee Estuary landscape is precious with sensitive habitats, home to a wealth of species. It is important that the natural environment is celebrated, enhanced and protected for future generations."""
One-way street plan aims to improve road safety,"Seven crashes have been recorded between 2019 and 2023 in the area, with five people left seriously injured.",23 Apr 2025,South Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgz9kvw9yo,"A central Sheffield street could be made one-way in a bid to make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists after several recent accidents.
A proposed traffic regulation order would bring in the change on a section of Oxford Street, with the measure due to be discussed by Sheffield City Council.
The proposal is part of a wider safety scheme aiming to address a history of road collisions in the Crookes Valley Road area.
Seven crashes have been recorded between 2019 and 2023 in the area, according to a council report, leaving five people seriously injured.
An existing zebra crossing could be replaced with a crossing controlled by traffic lights as part of the scheme, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
During a public consultation, concerns raised about the proposed traffic regulation order included increased pollution, speeding and parking issues.
The proposal is due to be discussed by the council's transport, regeneration and climate policy committee next week.

The dark WW2 history written into Germany's parks,"Eighty years after the end of World War Two, blasted trees and rubble forests tell a hidden story of wartime bombardment and Nazi terror.",30 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250429-we-planted-trees-among-the-rubble-the-dark-ww2-history-written-into-germanys-parks,"Eighty years after the end of World War Two, blasted trees and rubble forests tell a hidden story of wartime bombardment and Nazi terror.
In the early 1950s, Rudolf Schröder, a young gardener, led a group of apprentices through the abandoned plots of bombed houses in post-war Dresden. Their quest: to find tree saplings for planting along the city's streets. Dresden was still ravaged by the firebombing in February 1945 that killed tens of thousands of civilians. But slowly, here and in other cities across Germany, survivors were starting a green recovery.
""We searched the ruins of buildings with gardens for saplings and found lots of them – linden trees, maple, oak. We dug them up, and planted the best ones along the streets,"" recalls Schröder, who was born in 1933, speaking from his home in Dresden. ""It was a hard time, but we were full of hope.""
Saplings were hard to find as so many trees in public parks had been destroyed, and had to be replaced with stock from nurseries outside of the bombed city. It was when those nurseries ran out that Schröder and his friends resorted to the abandoned gardens – where many saplings had sprung up as the plots were left untended. There were enough young trees for some to be taken and replanted along the streets to cheer up the public, and others to be left in place, according to Schröder. Today, some of those rubble-sourced street trees planted by Schröder and his team still stand, for example along the Krenkelstraße street in Dresden, he says.
Eighty years after the end of World War Two and the fall of the Nazi regime, many of Germany's urban trees and green spaces still hold such hidden traces of the past. In post-war Berlin, rare plants suddenly thrived in bombed wastelands, and urban forests sprung up in the rubble. Forest also grew over abandoned Jewish graves, as the Jewish families that had tended those graves were deported and murdered in the Holocaust. Some bomb-scarred trees, and post-war rubble forests, have been turned into memorials and nature sanctuaries.
And in some cases, like that of Dresden's botanical garden and the adjacent Großer Garten (Great Garden) park, a lush green area holds a dark story from the intensifying Nazi terror to the war and its aftermath – giving insights into nature's surprising role as a witness and archive of human history, to this day.
""A new ban for Jews, from entering the Great Garden and other parks,"" wrote Victor Klemperer, a Jewish literary scholar in Dresden, in his secret diary in July 1940. Repeated across parks and botanical gardens all over Germany, the ban was one of many Nazi measures against Jews in the run-up to the Holocaust. Klemperer explained in his diary that the park ban was especially powerful as Jews already had almost nowhere to go in 1940s Germany: the Klemperers and others had been excluded from jobs, universities, schools and libraries, removed from their homes and put into communal housing with other Jews, and placed under a curfew. Having lost their own home and garden, Klemperer and his non-Jewish wife, Eva, bought flowerpots for their balcony to at least have the comfort of some greenery, as they nervously observed the increasing arrests and deportations of their friends and neighbours.
While the fact that Jews were banned from parks and other green spaces during the Nazi era is generally known in Germany, there is relatively little research on the subject. However, garden historian Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn argues in a book chapter on green spaces and antisemitic persecution in the Nazi era, that the park bans played an important role in the terror. He notes that the bans also show just how actively some ordinary people participated in the persecution. In cities such as Leipzig, Bremen, Berlin and Hannover, non-Jewish Germans denounced Jewish park visitors to Nazi authorities and helped implement the bans, he and others note. Individual cities took the initiative of banning Jews from benches and parks.
""The Nazi dictatorship relied on the voluntary support of many Germans in order to function,"" Wolschke-Bulmahn writes. He also points out that this aspect of the Nazi era is generally omitted from official histories of these parks.
Two archived letters from Dresden's botanical garden, provided by staff there, illustrate how meticulously the bans were pursued. ""It has been observed that Jews are using the botanical garden,"" a Nazi party official wrote to the garden's director in 1941, demanding that this be stopped and a sign put up with a ban. The director replied, saying Jews had now been banned from the garden, and that a sign had been put up.
The persecution ultimately affected every part of the botanical and gardening world across Germany, from parks to research departments, as Jewish-German botanists and horticulture students were exiled or murdered.
Victor and Eva Klemperer survived the war, even as others around them were deported to the death camps. When the Allied firebombing of Dresden began on 13 February 1945, the couple sensed their chance. Amid the chaos and destruction, Eva removed Victor's yellow star from his coat with a pocketknife, to hide his Jewish identity, and they fled the city and hid until Germany surrendered.
At the Weissensee Cemetery in Berlin, one of Europe's largest Jewish cemeteries, a patch of wild urban forest has been left standing as a memorial to the Holocaust. During the Nazi era, most of Berlin's Jews emigrated or were murdered. As a result, few people were left to tend the graves and the cemetery became overgrown, says Ingo Kowarik, a retired professor for ecosystem science and plant ecology at the Technical University Berlin. In 2016, he and his colleagues documented 604 species of plants and animals in the cemetery.
""Forests grow everywhere, including in the city. And on this cemetery, a forest has been growing since the post-war era,"" says Kowarik. While parts of the cemetery have been restored, and some growth cleared from the graves, many trees stayed. ""Some of the graves were restored along with the woodland around them, because this woodland is a reminder of the Holocaust,"" he says.
For Rudolf Schröder, Dresden's botanical garden offered a place of respite during his wartime childhood. In 1943, his father was briefly home from the war and took 10-year-old Rudolf on a visit there. ""We went to the big palm house. It was nice and warm, heated with coal, which was special in that wartime winter,"" he recalls.
Two years later, when the Allied bombs began to hit Dresden, the city's public gardens initially seemed to offer safety. ""Our mother decided that it would be safest in the Great Garden... We sat huddled together under a big oak in the park... Astonished, we watched the houses burn,"" wrote a survivor of the bombing, who was eight years old at the time and whose father worked in the botanical garden, in a document provided by the garden. More bombs followed the next day, shattering the palm house and leaving craters in the park
Schröder also survived the firebombing. But his father never returned from the war. ""That was very painful for me, because we were very close,"" he says. ""He taught me a lot about plants, and we would use a microscope together. He was passionate about biology.""
After the war, the Great Garden was turned into vegetable plots, and Schröder, still a schoolboy, planted corn and beans to feed his family. Later, as a teenager, he trained as a gardener and helped clear and replant the Great Garden.
""One day we were standing around an oak that was almost completely blasted by a bomb, and our boss asked, shall we cut it down?"" he says of those post-war years. ""But then we walked around to its other side and we saw that on that side, it was still alive and green.""
They decided to let the oak stay. ""And it still stands today. One side is dead, the other is alive. It's beset by many different fungi, but it still has so much vitality,"" says Schröder.
Known as the Splittereiche, ""splinter-oak"", the tree is preserved in the Great Garden as a monument. Schröder later became the director of the botanical garden, and continues to visit it now that he is retired.
Joe McBride, a professor emeritus of landscape architecture and environmental planning at University of California, Berkeley, interviewed Schröder and other gardeners, arborists and botanists in war-torn cities around the world, to study the reconstruction of urban forests destroyed by conflict.
""I found people like that all over the world, in Dresden, in Hiroshima, in spite of the fact that their cities were in ruins, they really had dedicated themselves to planting these trees,"" he says. Often these people had been professional arborists before the war, he says, ""but private citizens also made an effort to plant, to get the trees started, to replant the environment they had grown up in as children"".
Often, the cities' trees had been decimated by bombings and the need for firewood after the war, and tree nurseries were empty, forcing people to be resourceful. In Hiroshima, for example, local farmers donated trees to plant after the city's devastation by the atomic bomb, he says, and the city also conserved trees that survived the bomb.
One pattern McBride found across these destroyed cities was that trees provided the survivors with hope. ""People needed to recover psychologically as well as physically, they wanted that apple tree in their backyard, and that linden tree in front of their house – to leave the war behind them, and have nothing remind them of the horrors,"" he says of Dresden and Hamburg, two bombed German cities he studied together with Judith Stilgenbauer of the University of Hawaii.
In Berlin, that post-war recovery took a very different turn. Its ecosystems reflect its dramatic history as a city that was bombed, and then, divided at the end of World War Two. The US, Britain and France occupied West Berlin; the Soviet Union controlled East Berlin. The fate of the city soon became embroiled in the rising tensions between the former allies, a chapter that ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 Nov 1989.
""In Berlin, you do still see war damage on individual trees, for example, there are old oaks in Tiergarten with partly destroyed crowns and other injuries. It's an analogy to the famous bullet holes you still see in facades in Berlin,"" says the Technical University Berlin's Kowarik, who has studied the city's ecosystems for decades. ""However, the much, much more obvious impact of the war on Berlin's ecosystem is the destruction of wide parts of the inner city, the so-called 'dead eye' of Berlin, where more than half of the buildings were destroyed,"" he says.
In other German cities, such wasteland was quickly rebuilt, but in Berlin, the division – which left West Berlin as an island within the East, with a wall around it – stalled such development, Kowarik points out. In the 1970s, long after the end of the war, urban ecologists documented the plants growing in those wastelands.
""It was the beginning of an accidental large-scale experiment: the return of nature to areas that had been completely reshaped by humans,"" he says.
Some plants that had previously been rare in Berlin, found a perfect habitat in the city's rubble. One of them was a plant known as sticky goosefoot, which is native to dried-out riverbeds in the eastern Mediterranean, Kowarik says. It was cultivated in Berlin as a very rare garden plant. ""After the war, it expanded massively. There are old pictures of Potsdamer Platz [a central, iconic square in Berlin] when it was empty, and it's almost entirely covered by this plant,"" he says. ""Today, because the city has been developed again, that plant has again become very rare.""
However, he adds that it sometimes still germinates when the ground is disturbed during building works: ""It emerges from the seed stored in the soil, like a greeting from the post-war vegetation.""
Pennsylvania pellitory (Parietaria pensylvanica) is a another plant that colonised post-war Berlin. It was previously cultivated in Berlin's botanical garden and is thought to have spread when its seeds were blasted across the city in one of the bombings, Kowarik says, referring to these plants as Trümmervegetation, ""rubble vegetation"". Over time, those pioneer plants were then overtaken by shrubs and trees, a pattern of ecological succession seen both inside and outside of cities, he says.
""You see this succession in a lot of places in Berlin,"" he says, culminating in urban wild forest. In one area, the Schöneberger Südgelände, such a wild forest has been preserved for the public, as a nature reserve with accessible paths and artworks, he says: ""You have to show people that these wild forests are something special that has to do with the history of the city.""
In some green spaces in Berlin, military relics from the Nazi era, such as bunkers and anti-aircraft towers (known as flak towers), remain and have become refuges for species such as bats.
Other cities hastily covered up all traces of the war. In Hamburg, planners hoped that newly created green spaces such as the Alsterpark would help the city return to normal life, says Eliane Schmid, a doctoral researcher at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History.
""What you see very clearly with Hamburg [in the first decades after World War Two] is this idea of just skipping the Nazi era,"" she says. ""It's this idea of, 'the Nazi era was a misfortune that we slid into, and now we're a green city again, and a portal to the world'."" One of the city's first post-war initiatives was to put flowers on balconies around the main station, so visitors would feel welcome in Hamburg, she says.
Schröder, who planted those tree saplings in Dresden after the war, still regularly inspects the trees in the botanical garden, and examines their health. Lately, he has been worrying about the impact of climate change on them, he says, as he has noticed signs of stress from dry, hot periods, leaving the trees vulnerable to pests and fungi. He also likes to visit the Great Garden, where he and his friends once left that blasted oak, the Splittereiche, standing. Sounding contemplative, he says: ""When I'm there, I go to the Splittereiche. I look at its wounds.""

Low carbon heat plans for 150 homes approved,Cherwell District Council approves a central energy centre scheme for Upper Heyford homes.,12 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14xkevy680o,"Plans to heat more than 150 homes using low carbon energy have been approved.
Upper Heyford Parish Council applied to build a central energy centre, on land off Somerton Road in the village near Bicester, Oxfordshire, which is currently used for agriculture.
Under the proposal, 134 bore holes would be drilled to accommodate pipework and approximately 21,699 ft (6,614m) of trench work would connect the pipes to the energy centre.
Cherwell District Council unanimously approved the scheme during a planning meeting on Thursday.
In addition to heating 153 homes, the centre would also provide low carbon heat to the Barley Mow Public House, Upper Heyford Reading rooms and Upper Heyford Village Hall.
Oxfordshire County Council objected to the application, requesting further information about access to the site.
It also said the application failed to show the correct route of Upper Heyford bridleway.
But planning officers recommended the scheme for approval, stating it would reduce the homes' reliance on extracting energy from the grid, ""which in turn is generated by higher carbon generating methods"".
The plan also fits with ""the wider objectives of the Cherwell Climate Change Emergency"", they added.
The council declared a climate emergency in 2019 and wants to create a zero carbon district by 2030.
Council leader David Hingley said it was ""an environmentally sound, sustainable proposal"".
""It appears to have some level of local support and it's the sort of thing that should be supported,"" he added.

Australia's last vote was all about Indigenous people - now they say it's 'silence',Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.,30 Apr 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v6zy2nyvo,"On the journey into Yarrabah, there is nothing to suggest a national election is just days away.
Posters for candidates, inescapable in other parts of Australia, are conspicuously absent as you drive past fields of sugar cane and down a gently winding coastal road.
After entering this small Indigenous community near Cairns in far north Queensland, with fishing nets sitting on palm-lined shores, the only thing fighting for attention is a truck selling ice cream – urgently dinging a bell as it avoids the wild horses and dogs that wander the streets.
""It's weird,"" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. ""We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us.""
Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that ""they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns"".
""So,"" she asks ""what the hell's going on?""
Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country - something successive leaders have for years called a ""national shame"".
Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.
One glaring exception occurred this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous ""welcome to country"" ceremonies -  where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands - were ""overdone"" and should not take place so frequently.
The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people – and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.
Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore electorally risky – especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.
That referendum, which was loudly supported by Albanese in the most polarising moment of his leadership, saw 60% of voters reject a proposal to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's constitution and give them greater political say through a Voice to Parliament.
Those opposing it said the idea was divisive, would create special ""classes"" of citizens where some have more rights than others, and the new advisory body would slow government decision-making.
Ahead of the vote, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on both sides of the debate told the BBC they hoped the unprecedented level of interest in their lives would build momentum for more policies to improve them.
Ms Andrews was one of them. But now she looks back at the result with sadness, believing it has now led political parties to ""play it safe"" and avoid ""the hot Aboriginal issues"".
Others, including those who loudly opposed the Voice proposal, agree.
On referendum night, prominent anti-Voice campaigner Warren Mundine told the BBC ""now the hard work starts"".
Some 18 months on, he says the reality is that people on both sides of the political aisle promptly disengaged with Indigenous issues after the referendum.
""This is one of the sad things about this election campaign here: whether the Voice got up or didn't get up, we still had work to do,"" he said.
""What's happened now is that this is probably the first election that I've been in where there is no conversation about an Aboriginal policy. It's just gone silent.""
Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator in Victoria, told the BBC that ""Albanese particularly is too scared to mention us [Indigenous Australians] because of his failed referendum that we should never have had in the first place"".
Thorpe spearheaded an Indigenous-run Blak Sovereign movement opposing the Voice, calling instead for priority to be given to a legally binding treaty between First Nations peoples and the Australian government.
""In previous elections, even though we may have been an afterthought and tacked on the end of the sentences, like we always are, at least we were mentioned. Now it's complete silence,"" she said.
""This election could have been a real opportunity for both leaders to unite the nation and tell some truth about the plight of our people. They need to tell the truth that these injustices continue, and they need to tell the truth that they are in a position to change that, to turn that around.""
Since 2008, the Australian government's Closing the Gap strategy has sought to reduce levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the annual tracking of 18 key measures in areas such as health and education.
The latest review, however, found only four were on track to be met, while four were worsening – including the annual rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration, which was up 12% in a year.
Despite these trends, Professor Rodney Smith of the University of Sydney says the defeat of the Voice - including in many Labor strongholds - makes it ""electorally foolish"" to talk too much about First Nations issues this election.
He points to Coalition adverts that tie money ""wasted"" on the referendum – which is estimated to have cost more than $A400m – into the discussion about cost of living and a struggling economy.
Prof Smith also argues, however, that the 2025 election is not unprecedented in its lack of focus on Indigenous affairs, but rather a return to the norm after several years of the issues receiving more attention than usual.
""I'm not saying people shouldn't care about this,"" he says. ""I'm just saying that generally speaking, the electorate doesn't particularly care about it.""
Recent data from Australian National University (ANU) seems to back that up. A long-term study of voter attitudes found that between January 2024 and January 2025 there was a sharp decline in the number of people believing it was the government's responsibility to reduce the gap in living standards between First Nations Australians and the rest of the population.
""This lack of policy focus (by Labor and the Coalition) reflects a low prioritisation amongst the Australian population"" ANU's Professor Nicholas Biddle said.
Independent MP Bob Katter puts it more bluntly.
A former minister of Aboriginal Affairs when a Queensland state MP in the 1980s, Mr Katter says he thinks about the struggles of many Indigenous Australians ""every night before I go to bed"".
He told the BBC he believes in more self-governance and has campaigned to give greater access to farmable land and fishing rights.
He also admits he doesn't talk about those issues on the campaign trail, though.
""As a politician that's got to win votes in the election, I wouldn't be game,"" he told the BBC.
That's hard for many Indigenous people to swallow given the toll the referendum took - on those on both sides of the debate.
A report published by Sydney's University of Technology last month found that the Voice referendum led to an increase in hostile levels of racism towards First Nations People, recording 453 ""validated"" incidents of racism roughly six months either side of the vote.
About a fifth of all complaints contained mention of the failed referendum.
""While there was significant thought and debate given to the ideas of nation building and the righting of wrongs, the undercurrent of racism was ever present,"" said the report's guest author Professor Lindon Coombes in his introduction.
""This is its insidiousness.""
In Yarrabah, Ms Andrews becomes suddenly tearful, telling how her two daughters, studying at university in Brisbane, were intimidated and got ""so many racist remarks"" after the vote.
""To do this to young people, who have left community to better their life and to be something, is so wrong,"" she said.
It was not just increased racism that caused harm, but the tone and intensity of the debate leading up to the vote, many say.
Mr Mundine says his participation in the toxic and polarised national discussion meant he felt alienated from many in his community.
""I got kicked off boards. I lost jobs… [I] was ostracised.""
""Being the topic of every discussion for such a long period of time was overwhelming and extremely damaging to people's social and emotional well-being,""  says Clinton Schultz, a Gamilaroi/Gomeroi man, psychologist and Director of First Nations Strategy at the Black Dog Institute.
""The aftermath of that has left a lot of people not willing to engage in the debates moving forward.""
Millima May, a Kulumbirigin Danggalaba Tiwi woman from the Northern Territory, in 2023 told the BBC all First Nations people wanted was ""a seat at the table"" where decisions about their lives were made. But now there's been a ""tactical"" decision by some in the community to ""lie low"".
""I think a lot of Aboriginal people have really chosen to opt out of the political space and of so -called democracy in Australia,"" she says.
""If you could trust our political leaders and candidates to have nuanced and informed conversations, then you would be able to have debates and conversations in a respectful and safe way.
""But that is not how Australian politics is operating at the moment.""

Fears of global instability drive Singapore voters into ruling party's arms,The People's Action Party won by a landslide in an election dominated by concerns over the cost of living and the economy.,3 May 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly505gqwwpo,"Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has won by a landslide in an election dominated by concerns over the cost of living and the country's future economic stability.
Led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his first election since he became party leader last year, the PAP clinched 65.6% of the vote and an overwhelming majority of the 97 seats in parliament.
Singaporeans went to the polls on Saturday worrying about inflation, wage stagnation and job prospects.
The result will be widely seen as a flight to safety to the PAP amid fears of global turbulence.
""Singapore feels particularly vulnerable given its economy's size and exposure to international forces… Also we are notoriously risk-averse voters,"" said Ian Chong, an associate professor in political science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
The main opposition, the centre-left Workers' Party (WP), failed to capture more seats but continued to hold on to its 10 seats in parliament.
The centre-right PAP has governed Singapore continuously since 1959, making it one of the longest-ruling political parties in the world.
It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have seen the country flourish under PAP rule.
But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.
In the last three polls prior to Saturday's result, the PAP saw two of its lowest-ever vote shares, while the WP made increasing inroads in parliament.
The PAP won a reduced majority in the 2020 election, in what was seen as a referendum on their handling of the Covid outbreak.
But Saturday's result saw the PAP return to form, as voters gave Wong a strong mandate.
In a televised address early on Sunday, he thanked voters and said the results ""will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world"".
""Many are watching the election closely, whether it's international media, investors or foreign governments, they would have taken note of tonight's results,"" he said.
""It's a clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government. Singaporeans, too, can draw strength from this and look ahead to our future.""
While its open and globalised economy remains fairly buoyant, Singapore saw inflation surge in the last few years.
The government has attributed this to external factors such as the Ukraine and Gaza wars and supply chain disruptions. Critics however say a controversial goods and services tax hike exacerbated it.
With the US-China trade war under way and a 10% US tariff looming, authorities and experts have warned of shocks to the economy and possibly a technical recession.
Against this backdrop, the PAP campaigned on a message of stability.
Wong repeatedly promised that his team would ""steer Singapore through the storm"", while warning that if more opposition MPs were elected, he would lose capable ministers at a time when good governance was most needed.
It was a message that resounded with many voters. One PAP supporter, a start-up owner who only wanted to be known as Amanda, told the BBC that her business has been affected with clients pausing some projects due to the economic climate.
""The headwinds are not great, there's a lot of uncertainty… I want a party with experience [running the government],"" she said.
Though the PAP saw a series of scandals in recent years, including one involving a cabinet minister, this was hardly a talking point during the election period. Analysts said it was further from people's minds given more immediate concerns about the economy.
Some see the result as a sign of confidence in Wong, who led Singapore's Covid taskforce and became a familiar face as he regularly addressed the public during the pandemic.
""He's shown that he is capable, with the Covid taskforce giving him credence. He was the guiding hand on that rudder… and he projects that stability for future global financial uncertainties,"" said Rebecca Tan, a political science lecturer with NUS.
Wong is the first PAP prime minister to have improved the party's vote share in his first election. Previous PMs saw dips in the polls in what analysts used to call the ""new PM"" effect"", or a reflection of voters' uncertainty in a new leader.
The PAP's strong result was also partly due to a fragmented opposition, with 10 parties going up against them. With few exceptions, most performed poorly.
Teo Kay Key, a research fellow at the think tank Institute of Policy Studies, said that despite recent elections showing there was a desire for political diversity, the latest result ""shows that people are happy with the number of opposition MPs"" for now.
But, she added, Singaporeans also ""seem to be more selective"" now when it comes to casting votes for the opposition, pointing to the WP's performance.
The WP had campaigned on a platform of lowering the cost of living and strengthening the safety net.
While it failed to win more seats, it also saw increased vote shares in the constituencies it retained and close fights with the PAP in others, cementing its status as the country's strongest opposition party.
It turned in a robust performance despite recent controversial cases involving a former Workers' Party MP and WP leader Pritam Singh, who were both found guilty of lying to parliament. Many in the WP's support base believe the case, against Singh especially, was politically motivated.
Addressing supporters shortly after the results for his constituency were declared, Singh acknowledged that ""it was always going to be a difficult election"".
But he added: ""The slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again."""
"Butterflies need us to mow lawns less, experts say","Alarmed at declining numbers of the insects, conservationists are asking gardeners to keep grass long.",28 Apr 2025,Wiltshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l060zwrero,"Gardeners are being urged to resist mowing their entire lawns in efforts to support struggling butterfly populations.
Last year was one of the worst years on record for butterflies, according to the results of Butterfly Conservation's Big Butterfly Count.
Experts at the organisation say mixed lengths of grass are best for providing food and shelter, ideally with naturally occuring plants such as dandelions left to flower.
Robin Griffiths, part of the Wiltshire branch of Butterfly Conservation, said: ""When you mow your lawn, don't mow it all. To mow the lawn completely and regularly through the summer does very little for insects.""
Conservationists declared a national butterfly crisis after last year's count.
Mr Griffiths said gardeners should exercise restraint between now and September.
""It's not just a one year problem, over half of the British species are in long term decline and it's the first time ever that this has been the case,"" he said.
Mr Griffiths said rare butterflies and common garden species alike had been affected.
""The most desperate of the lot is the small tortoise shell which many people know and love as a garden butterfly,"" Mr Griffiths said. ""Since the 70s it's declined by 86%.""
The decline in the tortoise shell has been blamed on human activity, the use of pesticides and climate change.
Maurice Avent, vice president at the Butterfly Conservation, said farming practices were having huge impacts on the insect.
""In the past, a hay field was a multitude of different species – many species of flower and grass all growing together,"" he said.
""Nowadays, in nearly every case, one crop is used to make silage or hay.
""That's why gardens are so important, because a garden can almost be like a mixed meadow – they're a very vital area of conservation for butterflies these days.""

ANC U-turn over tax that threatened South Africa's government,The finance minister drops a planned VAT increase after one party in the coalition government goes to court.,24 Apr 2025,Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg2rve3vvo,"South Africa's finance minister has dropped plans to increase value-added tax (VAT), in a major climbdown to prevent the collapse of the coalition government.
Enoch Godongwana's decision came after the second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), threatened to quit the government, warning a VAT hike would hurt the poor the most.
Godongwana, a member of President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC), had argued the increase was needed as the government was facing a financial crisis.
But with other parties also rejecting the hike, it raised the prospect of parliament taking the unprecedented step of voting down the national budget, forcing him and the ANC to concede.
The climbdown is likely to be a relief for many South Africans, who are already struggling financially because of the high cost of living and an unemployment rate of 32%.
The ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since since white-minority rule ended in 1994 in last year's elections, forcing it to share power.
The DA welcomed the climbdown, saying it had entered the government ""with steel spines and a clear mission: grow the economy and create jobs to rescue South Africa"".
""We opposed the unjust VAT hike from day one - and South Africa won,"" it said in a statement.
The DA had also challenged the hike in the High Court, with three judges - who heard the case - expected to give their ruling before the end of the month.
Godongwana had proposed increasing Vat by half a percentage point, to 15.5% with effect from 1 May, saying it would help provide much-needed revenue to improve public services like education and health.
The ANC denied it had bowed to pressure by scrapping the increase.
The decision had been taken out a of ""a shared commitment across party lines that the working class, the poor, and all other people cannot be further burdened in this economic climate"", said party spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri.
In a statement, the finance ministry said there would now be a need to revisit ""other expenditure decisions"" and to scrap ""measures to cushion lower income households""  from the planned VAT hike.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF),  the second-biggest opposition party in parliament, said South Africa had witnessed a ""budget fiasco"", and the ""incompetent"" Godongwana should resign.
The ANC was banking on smaller parties - especially Action SA, which was seen as the kingmaker - to gain a parliamentary majority for the budget, but it refused to budge on its demand for the increase to be dropped.
The hike was also opposed by the biggest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu), which is in alliance with the ANC.
Even the head of the government's tax agency questioned the proposed increase, saying the last hike in 2018 did not significantly boost government revenue.
The crisis is likely to further damage the ANC's credibility, with opinion polls suggesting that its popularity is falling.
An opinion poll released earlier this month by the Institute of Race Relations put the party's support at 29.7%, while a poll in February by the Social Research Foundation put it at 32%. Both had a margin of error of around 4%.
The foundation said a ""significant chunk"" of ANC voters were ""so dissatisfied with the party and uncertain about their future voting intention"" that they had become ""free agents in South Africa's voting market"".
In last year's election, the ANC's share of the vote slumped to 40%, from 58% in the 2019 poll.

Brook given special status to save rare crayfish,Jerusalem Farm is home to one of the county's last remaining populations of white-clawed crayfish.,19 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2zm3zz87o,"A stream which is home to one of West Yorkshire's last remaining populations of endangered white-clawed crayfish has been awarded protected status.
Luddenden Brook, at Jerusalem Farm nature reserve near Halifax, has been granted Local Wildlife Site Status, giving official protection both to the crayfish species and the brook.
The new classification means biosecurity measures will be increased at the site, including putting up educational boards and providing special boot cleaning stations to reduce transfer of crayfish plague from people's clothing and shoes.
White-clawed crayfish are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list of threatened species that are considered endangered.
The UK's only native freshwater crayfish, they are under threat due to the spread of invasive North American signal crayfish.
Signal crayfish not only compete for the same food and habitat as white-clawed crayfish but also spread crayfish plague, a disease which is deadly to white-clawed crayfish.
Scott Patient, Calderdale Council's cabinet member for climate action said: ""Jerusalem Farm is one of the few places in West Yorkshire where the white-clawed crayfish can currently be found and I'm delighted that the Luddenden Brook, which runs through the site, has been granted Local Wildlife Status.
""This official status allows us to better protect this important habitat and helps to raise awareness of the plight of the native crayfish.""

Battery farm set for approval despite objections,Residents have raised numerous concerns about building a battery energy storage site in Holmfield.,16 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg700eny9no,"Plans for a large energy storage unit in a West Yorkshire village have been recommended for approval despite hundreds of objections.
Masdar Arlington Energy wants to build the battery energy storage system (BESS) on an industrial estate in Holmfield.
Of more than 400 representations received, all but four were objections, including one from Halifax MP Kate Dearden who said dozens of constituents had contacted her with concerns.
Masdar Arlington Energy said BESS sites were ""a cornerstone of the UK's strategy to achieve climate change targets"" and the plans would ""deliver no significant adverse impact"".
The units are being built across the UK to help balance the electricity grid, which is becoming increasingly powered by renewables.
The systems hold electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind turbines and solar farms.
However, concerns raised include the potential fire risk, impact on traffic as well as fears it would compound the effects of the ""Holmfield hum"" - a mystery low-level hum that some residents claim they can hear.
Residents have also said the site was not an appropriate place for such a development due to it being close to people's homes and a school.
If approved, it would also have a detrimental effect on tourism and property values, objectors said.
Yvonne Conner, who lives nearby, said she had spoken with many people who were ""petrified"" about the development being given the go-ahead.
""People's mental health is already really bad because everyone is saying how worried they are about it.
""If you're a councillor and you make that decision and that place goes up in flames I don't know how you would be able to live with yourself.
""We're not against renewable energy, but these kind of developments need to be in the right place, not here.""
A council report said the consultation response from the authority's economy, housing and investment team had ""lent strong support to the application"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
It stated: ""They highlight the importance of the transition away from fossil fuels with references to energy security where the war in the Ukraine and the associated price shocks in the energy system has resulted in record high bills for businesses and residents in Calderdale and the whole UK.""
According to the report, the applicant said the BESS scheme in Holmfield was capable of delivering 500MW.
The report said: ""This would have the capacity to store and supply enough energy to power approximately 1.62 million UK homes for two hours.
""This level of power would go far beyond local interest and need within Calderdale.""
It also listed counter arguments to residents' objections including that once built, the traffic impact would be be minimal and it was in an ""isolated setting from residential properties"".
The report, which will be decided on 28 April, added an outline battery safety management plan had been submitted and the applicant was ""required to consider and apply the new, or the latest guidance, technologies and good practices for battery fire detection"".

Reform-run council told it could stop solar farm,Reform UK leader Nigel Farage lists some decisions the party's newly-elected councillors could make.,3 May 2025,Stoke & Staffordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgenl77d50wo,"Newly-elected Reform UK councillors have been celebrating after they swept to power and took control of Staffordshire County Council, but were warned their task was not straightforward.
Party leader Nigel Farage spoke to members at the County Showground after results came in and listed some of the decisions they could make.
He said among their choices were saying no to a proposed wind farm in the Staffordshire Moorlands and a solar farm in Cheadle while he also suggested days were numbered in the county for those with a ""woke"" agenda.
Farage told Reform councillors: ""I wish you all the luck in the world. It won't be easy, it will be a learning curve, but it is an incredible opportunity.""
The final tally for Staffordshire shows Reform now has 49 out of 62 seats after winning 41% of the overall vote.
Going into the election, Reform had no councillors in the county and the Conservatives held 53 of the 62 seats.
Farage branded the authority under the previous Conservative administration as ""very woke"".
He said: ""Maybe a bit of a warning if you do work for Staffordshire County Council and you are involved in climate change policy, or involved with DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), or anything like that, it may be time to go and look for a different job.""
He added: ""Here in Staffordshire we are now in charge.
""County councils are there to perform basic functions for taxpayers. We want to slim down the size of local government and re-prioritise it on what its job really is.""
Separately, on the topic of such streamlining, Farage has spoken of his wish for there to be ""a Doge in every county"" - a reference to the Department of Government Efficiency set up by US President Donald Trump with the aim of cutting government spending.
Tony Travers, professor of public policy at the London School of Economics, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been 15 years of cuts to local council budgets and warned it would be ""very, very hard to find substantial savings in this part of the public sector"".
While in Staffordshire, Farage also raised the issue of asylum seekers, saying: ""There is a sense of unfairness, bordering on resentment, that tens of thousands of young men come into our country, get put up in hotels, get given everything.""
Councils don't have control over nationwide immigration policy, although Farage has said Reform will ""resist central government plonking hundreds of these young men in these counties that we now run"".
The Home Office is in charge of housing adult asylum seekers while a decision is made on whether they can continue to live in the UK and it is unclear how councils could stop people being accommodated in their area.
Martin Murray, Reform UK's Staffordshire county co-ordinator and new councillor for Cannock town, said the feeling after the election was ""one of excitement, exhilaration and anticipation to get started to do that work"".
He said: ""I knew the day was coming up when we were going to take control of this council. I could feel it across the streets of the whole county.
""We have gone beyond expectations and we thank everybody for that vote of confidence and we will deliver back to it.""

Hopes rare dragonfly will thrive at new site,Conservation teams have been collecting and transporting larvae to the new site in buckets.,22 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrzngpv589o,"A rare dragonfly is being introduced to a hidden corner of Cumbria.
The white-faced darter, named for its distinctive chalk-white profile, has seen its numbers severely decline in England where it only exists in a handful of sites.
Having suffered from its lowland peatbog habitats being destroyed over the years, the creature will find a new home at RSPB Campfield Marsh nature reserve in Wigton later this week.
Mhairi Maclauchlan, Cumbria coastal reserves manager, called it an ""exciting opportunity to boost biodiversity"" and help create a new population of a ""charming but endangered species"".
Small but striking, the male white-faced darter is black with vibrant red-orange markings, while females are black and yellow.
Other than the west of Scotland, they can only be found in a few places in the Midlands, as well as at Cumbria Wildlife Trust's Drumburgh Moss and Foulshaw Moss nature reserves.
Conservationists at RSPB Campfield Marsh have been carefully managing the area to create just the right habitat conditions for it to thrive.
""By carefully restoring the wetland habitat we're hopeful that these dragonflies will establish themselves here,"" said Ms Maclauchlan.
""If this year's translocation is successful, we could see adults emerging next spring and this area coming alive with this species in the coming years.""
Staff and volunteers have collected moss containing dragonfly larvae and transported it in buckets from a stable donor population to the site on the shores of the Solway Firth, one of the UK's largest estuaries.
It is a process which will be carried out each April and August for up to five years to ensure new life can establish.
Eleanor Colver, British Dragonfly Society conservation officer, said: ""The white-faced darter is one of our rarest dragonflies and we are committed to stabilising the British population.
""Success will depend on many factors, but the cooler climate of the Solway coast and the healthy peatbog of Campfield Marsh provide perfect conditions for the species to thrive.""

Industrial waste turning into rock 'in decades',"A tyre, an aluminium drinks can tab and a 1934 coin are found in rock on the Cumbrian coast.",29 Apr 2025,UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86j2x4d29lo,"Industrial waste is turning into rock in ""decades"", much faster than the millions of years it is thought to take for it to form naturally, according to research carried out along the Cumbrian coast.
An aluminium drinks can tab, which was designed post 1989, and a 1934 coin featuring George V were among items found embedded in rock at Derwent Howe.
Researchers at the University of Glasgow documented a new ""rapid anthropoclastic rock cycle"", which mimics natural cycles but involves human material over accelerated timescales.
They warn the development of rock around industrial waste sites could have negative impacts on ecosystems as well as land planning.
Their findings came from analysis of a two-kilometre (1.25-mile) stretch of slag deposit, which was home to iron and steel-making foundries during the 19th and 20th centuries.
The deposits have formed cliffs of waste material which are being eroded by coastal waves and tides, and the team carried out analysis after noticing irregular formations in the cliffs.
Dr Amanda Owen, one of the study's authors, said: ""For a couple of hundred years, we've understood the rock cycle as a natural process that takes thousands to millions of years.
""What's remarkable here is that we've found these human-made materials being incorporated into natural systems and becoming lithified - essentially turning into rock - over the course of decades instead.
""It challenges our understanding of how a rock is formed, and suggests that the waste material we've produced in creating the modern world is going to have an irreversible impact on our future.""
Laboratory tests helped researchers determine that Derwent Howe's slag materials contain deposits of calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese.
These elements are highly chemically reactive, which is key to causing the accelerated process of rock formation.
When the slag is eroded by the sea, it exposes the material to seawater and air, which interacts with the slag's reactive elements to create natural cements including calcite, goethite, and brucite.
These cements are the same materials that bind together natural sedimentary rocks, but the chemical reactions cause the process to happen much faster than has been assumed to happen with similar material in a natural rock cycle.
Co-author Dr John MacDonald said the aluminium can tab which was found embedded in the material had a design that researchers ""realised couldn't have been manufactured before 1989"".
""This gives us a maximum timeframe of 35 years for this rock formation, well within the course of a single human lifetime.""
Dr David Brown, the paper's third co-author, said the ""rapid appearance of rock could fundamentally affect the ecosystems above and below the water, as well as change the way that coastlines respond to the challenges of rising sea levels and more extreme weather as our planet warms"".
He added: ""Currently, none of this is accounted for in our models of erosion of land management, which are key to helping us try to adapt to climate change.""
The research is published in the journal Geology.

Reform UK makes big gains in English local elections,Nigel Farage's party gains its first foothold in local government after seizing hundreds of seats.,3 May 2025,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6j8e38p79o,"Nigel Farage's Reform UK has made big gains in English local elections, cementing it as a prime challenger to Britain's traditional main parties.
It won 677 of around 1,600 seats contested on Thursday across a clutch of mainly Tory-held councils last contested in 2021.
Reform seized control of eight authorities from the Conservatives, including former strongholds Kent and Staffordshire.
The party has also won control of Doncaster, the only council Labour was defending, and Durham, where Labour was previously the largest party.
Reform also displaced Labour in Runcorn and Helsby, where it won a tightly-fought Westminster by-election to make Sarah Pochin its fifth MP.
As well as winning control of its first-ever councils, Reform has also won its first mayoral contests in the newly-created combined authorities of Greater Lincolnshire, and Hull and East Yorkshire.
A jubilant Farage said the results meant Reform had overtaken the Tories as the main opposition party to Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government.
The elections in 23 councils, across mainly rural and suburban areas of England, marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory last year.
The Tories, who were defending the most seats, had been braced for big losses since the councils up for re-election were last contested in 2021, when the party was riding high under Boris Johnson during the Covid vaccine rollout.
But their results have been even worse than expected, with the party losing over 676 seats and control of all the 16 authorities it was defending.
It captured the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough mayoralty from Labour - a silver lining for the party in an otherwise dismal set of results.
Reacting to the results in the Times on Saturday, Sir Keir said he shared in the ""sharp edge of fury"" felt by voters leaning away from the major parties, arguing that it spurs him on to ""go further and faster"" in delivering Labour's promised changes to public services, immigration and cost of living pressures.
Tory leader Kemi Badenoch acknowledged that her party was facing a ""long journey"" to rebuild after its long spell in government, adding that ""protest is in the air"" in a ""very competitive political environment"".
Writing for the Telegraph, she acknowledged the results had been a ""bloodbath"" for her party, but argued it had been ""making progress"" under her leadership, including on party unity and holding Labour ministers to account.
Labour, which was defending far fewer seats this year, was down by 186 seats.
It held a trio of mayoralties in Doncaster, North Tyneside and the West of England, but saw its share of the vote significantly dented by Reform in all of them.
Sir Keir said the results showed the need for his party to go ""further and faster"" to deliver on voters' priorities in government, adding: ""I get it.""
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said his party had supplanted the Conservatives as the ""party of Middle England"" after gaining 163 seats.
The party seized Shropshire from the Tories, and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire, two county councils where previously no party was in overall control.
They have also become the biggest party in Hertfordshire and Wiltshire, as well as in Gloucestershire and Devon, where they narrowly fell short of overall majorities.
The Greens gained over 40 seats, but will have been disappointed not to snatch the West of England mayoral contest from Labour, where they came a narrow third to Reform.
The BBC is estimating that, if elections had taken place across Britain on Thursday, the Conservatives would have slumped to just 15% of the national vote, its worst-ever share of such a projection, behind the Liberal Democrats on 17%.
Labour would have won 20% of the vote, according to the projection, equalling its lowest previous recorded performance in 2009.
It is the first time the combined projected share of the vote for the Conservatives and Labour has fallen below 50%, underlining the continuing fragmentation of the British political landscape.
Farage has made gaining a foothold in town halls a key staging post ahead of the next UK general election, which is expected in 2029.
Before Thursday's elections it only had around 100 councillors, mainly as a result of defections from other parties.
However, the results will also increase scrutiny of how his party performs in office and how it intends to wield its newly-acquired local powers.
During the campaign, both the Reform UK and Tory leaders were repeatedly questioned during media interviews about how their local councillors might co-operate with each other after the elections.
Farage ruled out striking formal coalitions with other parties to share power, but left the door open to more informal forms of co-operation, including the Conservatives.
That position could soon be put to the test in councils including Leicestershire and Worcestershire, where it fell short of a majority despite becoming the largest party.
Speaking to supporters on Friday, Farage said his party would seek to ""reduce excessive expenditure"" in local government, and suggested his councillors would scale back local diversity and climate policies.
He added his party would also look to push back on asylum seekers being housed in hotels, saying he was opposed to the government ""plonking scores of young men"" in counties where his party now has control."
County flower's population sees 'dramatic increase',"Nearly 30,000 snake's-head fritillaries are found at an Oxford nature reserve during the 2025 count.",22 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vn0p52q2go,"Oxfordshire's county flower has seen a resurgence, as more than five times last year's total were counted during an annual census.
Nearly 30,000 snake's-head fritillaries were found at Iffley Meadows nature reserve by Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT) volunteers this year.
The wildlife trust said the 2025 count had ""lifted spirits"" of its volunteers, as it saw a ""dramatic increase"" on last years count.
In 2024, the trust tallied a ""devastating"" 6,087 flowers - a 30-year low which was attributed to prolonged flooding, heavy rain and high winds.
In total, 29,522 flowers were counted by volunteers in 2025 - an increase of more than 380% on the previous year.
BBOWT senior ecologist Colin Williams, who was in charge of the count, said the trust was ""encouraged"" by the final tally at this year's count.
""While it remained well below previous peak records, it's a vast improvement on last year's disappointing result,"" he said.
Iffley Meadows, which is a floodplain meadow, is one of only 30 sites in the UK where snake's-head fritillaries bloom in the wild.
The trust has held annual counts of the flower at the site in Oxford since the early 1980s.
The very first count in 1983 recorded just 500 flowers, but careful management has since seen its population flourish - with a peak of nearly 90,000 counted in 2015.
Since then, the numbers have fluctuated - with Mr Williams saying this was down to flooding, weather and the impact of grazing deer.
""Increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather events as a result of climate change make it harder to anticipate what we will see in following years,"" he added.

Flowers on ex-industrial sites 'harming bees',"Metals in brownfield land can harm pollinators when wildflowers bloom there, say researchers.",16 Apr 2025,Cambridgeshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x97k2095o,"Wildflowers growing on brownfield former industrial land could damage the health of pollinators like bees, say researchers.
A University of Cambridge study found brownfield soil could accumulate lead, arsenic and metal contaminants.
It said metals had already been shown to damage the health of pollinators, which ingest them in nectar as they feed, leading to reduced population sizes and death.
Report author Dr Sarah Scott said the results should not stop people from planting wildflowers, and they wanted to raise awareness of the importance of soil health for bees.
Researchers said common plants like white clover, bindweed, wild carrot and chicory plant were all vital forage for pollinators in cities, but they could accumulate arsenic, cadmium, chromium and lead from contaminated soils.
The metals typically increased with the age of a city and came from different sources including cement dust and mining.
Research was carried out in the US city of Cleveland, Ohio.
The report advised that testing of soils should take place before sowing wildflowers on ex-industrial land.
In areas where species self-seed, regular mowing could stop wildflowers growing and thus reduce the risk of polluted nectar being ingested by insects.
Dr Scott, from the university's Department of Zoology, said: ""It's really important to have wildflowers as a food source for the bees, and our results should not discourage people from planting wildflowers in towns and cities.
""We hope this study will raise awareness that soil health is also important for bee health.
""Before planting wildflowers in urban areas to attract bees and other pollinators, it's important to consider the history of the land and what might be in the soil – and if necessary find out whether there's a local soil testing and cleanup service available first.""
The study, published in the Ecology and Evolution journal, said there was evidence wild pollinator populations had dropped by more than 50% in the last 50 years.
It said this was caused primarily by changes in land use and management across the globe as well as climate change and pesticide use.
Dr Scott said: ""Climate change feels so overwhelming, but simply planting flowers in certain areas can help towards conserving pollinators, which is a realistic way for people to make a positive impact on the environment.""

New pope should 'carry on legacy of Francis',Pupils at a Catholic school share their hopes about which path the new pontiff should take.,6 days ago,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705010prp4o,"The election of a new pope has begun following the death of Pope Francis last month. The secret conclave of 131 Catholic cardinals are locked in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican City until a new pontiff is chosen.
Pupils from Notre Dame High School in Norwich shared their hopes and aspirations for the next leader of the world's largest Christian church.
Luis said his faith and belief in God was important to his understanding of life.
""I'm quite excited to see who the new pope is going to be,"" he said.
""Personally I have my favourite - Louis Antonio Tagle - because he has a little sense of humility in him.
""Pope Francis obviously had the same [humility]. He was very kind to people - the poor people.""
Victoria hoped the new pontiff would continue Pope Francis's legacy.
""I don't think erasing that would do any good for the Catholic Church because we're not very well liked between [among some] minorities and gay people,"" she said.
""And I think what he [Pope Francis] did, in helping us is gain time with different people.
""He really connected with ordinary people, not just cardinals and priests. He heard what we needed to say.""
The Pope increased the role of women in the church, but stopped short of allowing them to become clergy.
Victoria however, differed on this men-only stance. ""We deserve main roles too, it's not just men.""
Fellow pupil Alfie praised the late Pope for taking on concerns about the environment, the impact of climate change on the planet, as well as his concern about the poor.
""I think the new pope should really take that into account and be able to speak on those topics,"" he said.
""And also being able to progress the church while also aligning with the tradition of the church.""
Persy was excited about the election of the new head of her church and said it was an ""incredibly important decision"".
""The pope can change a lot of people's lives,"" she said.
""But because of the way the conclave is, it's from the Holy Spirit, and so I think we can trust the right choice will be made.""
She said  the selection of a new pontiff was ""absolutely"" a special time for Catholics.
At the Catholic state school, pupils held a minute's silence and prayed for the ""right choice"" to be made by the conclave, Percy said.
""The pope is such an important part of being Catholic, of being Christian - he's in charge,"" she said.
She would like to see the next Holy Father ""carry on all things that Pope Francis did"".
The first vote expected to take place early on Wednesday evening, and the world will be informed of the cardinals' choice by coloured smoke issuing from a chimney in the chapel.
Black smoke indicates a new man has not been chosen, while white smoke means one has been selected.
About 1.4 billion people across the world identify as Roman Catholic.

The secret keepers of Japan's cherry blossoms,"For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished – and highly sought-out – symbols.",23 Apr 2025,Travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250422-japans-97-year-old-cherry-blossom-guardian,"For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished – and highly sought-out – symbols.
Each spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.
This 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old Tōemon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).
For more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.
According to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.
As Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. ""It can be said that Tōemon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,"" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.
On a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name Tōemon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uetō Zōen, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.
For more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world – including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the Taishō period (1912–1926).
But just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uetō Zōen and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next Tōemon and sakuramori.
As we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by Tōemon's father, the 15th Tōemon Sano.
Though sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.
""If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,"" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised – as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.
""The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,"" Tōemon later told me over email after being released from hospital. ""Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.""
Cherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace – a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.
Today, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, Tōemon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.
In 1902, English naturalist Collingwood ""Cherry"" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.
Given the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out Tōemon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.
Where to see Tōemon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:
In addition to admiring Tōemon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).
Tōemon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura – taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. Tōemon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.
Today, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have Tōemon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire Tōemon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.
Even at 97, Tōemon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles – all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.
""My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,"" Tōemon said. ""My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seikō-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'… If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.""
More like this:
• The 96-year-old painter who saved a village
• The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo
• Japan's unusual way to view the world
To that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, Tōemon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, Tōemon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.
As I toured the Sano family garden, falling cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation. Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of ""mono no aware"" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.
""Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,"" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child – a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.
""It will depend on her decision,"" Shinichi said.
For now, though, the family is allowing the 16th Tōemon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.
""While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,"" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of Tōemon Sano and sakuramori.
""I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,"" Shinichi said. ""I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name… I'll do what I'm asked to.""

What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself?,How to protect yourself from UV radiation.,29 Apr 2025,Health,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckmg1572e8ko,"Temperatures could reach 28C (82F) on Thursday, with the warm weather is expected to bring high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
UV radiation is emitted by the Sun and penetrates the Earth's atmosphere.
Some exposure is essential for our wellbeing, but too much can cause skin damage.
UV is beneficial because it enables our skin to produce essential vitamin D.
This is important for the function of bones, blood cells and our immune system.
But we need to be careful about how much time we spend in the sunshine, warns Prof Dorothy Bennett, from St George's, University of London.
""Every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer.
""Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing.""
UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells.
It also plays a substantial role in skin ageing, contributing to wrinkles and loosened folds.
UV exposure has also been linked to eye problems, including cataracts.
Levels of UV radiation vary throughout the day.
The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around ""solar noon"", when the sun is at its highest - usually from late morning to early afternoon.
The UV Index (or UVI) is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation.
Values start at zero and can rise above 10.
The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur.
Countries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year.
Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Majorca in Spain normally hits nine in June and July.
But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually get above five, even in summer.
According to the WHO, no sun protection is required when levels are:
Some sun protection is required when levels are:
Extra sun protection is required when UV levels are:
Children are more sensitive to UV radiation than adults, and therefore require additional protection at lower levels.
The NHS advises:
Global research shows people often miss parts of their bodies when putting on sunscreen, according to Dr Bav Shergill from the British Association of Dermatologists.
""People often forget the side of their nose - where I have seen a lot of skin cancer,"" he says.
Other areas which need to be covered include the temples and the upper chest.
As a guide, adults should aim to apply about six to eight teaspoons of sunscreen if covering the entire body.
There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan, according to the NHS.
Dr Shergill recommends using self-tan products instead.
""When you tan, ultraviolet light stimulates your skin cells to produce pigment to try and protect the DNA of skin cells - but that protection is minimal -  the equivalent of SP4.
""That is not much protection at all - so you can still burn very early,"" he warns.
The amount of UV reaching your skin is not driven by the daily temperature, says Dr Michaela Hegglin, from the University of Reading.
""UV levels on a bright and breezy late April day in the UK will be about the same as a warm sunny day in August.""
""Your skin can burn just as quickly whether it's 30C or 20C,"" warns BBC Weather's BBC Weather's Helen Willetts.
""Don't be caught out on cloudy days. UV will still penetrate thin clouds - so even if you don't think it's that sunny, you can still burn.""
Yes, according to Dr Shergill.
""The skin may look darker, but it doesn’t always behave that way from a protection point of view  – because there are more genes at play than we think about,"" he says.
""I have, for example, seen South Asian people with skin cancer and I have seen people with dual-heritage get skin cancer.""
The broader risks of eye damage and harmful effects on the immune system from too much UV radiation affect people of all skin colour."
'Inspiring' Museum of the Year nominees all outside London,The winner of the Art Fund prize will be announced this summer at a ceremony in Liverpool.,29 Apr 2025,Culture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3v7ngn7nvo,"The nominees for the 2025 Art Fund Museum of the Year have been announced, with all five finalists being located outside of London for the first time in four years.
Beamish, The Living Museum of the North in County Durham is up for the £120,000 prize-winning pot alongside Cardiff's Chapter and Compton Verney in Warwickshire.
Belfast's Golden Thread Gallery and the Perth Museum in Perth and Kinross round off the shortlist.
Art Fund director Jenny Waldman said that this year's finalists ""are inspiring examples of museums at their best"" and ""deeply connected to their local communities, responsive to the world around them, and alive with energy and ideas.""
""Each one offers a distinctive experience, showing the endless creativity and care that goes into making museums inspiring and exciting spaces for everyone,"" she noted, speaking on behalf of the award judges.
The winner will be announced on Thursday 26 June at a ceremony at the Museum of Liverpool, marking the first time the event has ever been held outside of the UK capital.
Let's take a closer look at the nominees for this year's prize, which are all now guaranteed to receive at least £15,000.
Beamish, The Living Museum of the North in County Durham is an open-air museum which reflects life in north east England in the 19th and 20th centuries.
It brings Georgian, Edwardian and war-time history to life through immersive exhibits where visitors engage with costumed staff and volunteers.
Judges praised Beamish for continuing its ""long-standing commitment to preserving local heritage"" and its ""exceptional visitor experience"".
In the past year the museum has completed its Remaking Beamish project, which saw the recreation of a 1950s town developed with community input, as well as the opening of the aged miners' homes (AMH), which tells the story of welfare provision provided for retired miners.
This year, as part of the National Railway 200 celebrations, it will also host the Festival of Transport (24 May-1 June).
Chapter is an international centre for contemporary arts in Cardiff, which includes a gallery, artists' studios, theatres and cinema screenings.
In recent years, the centre has commissioned fourteen exhibitions by diverse international artists - including Adham Faramawy, Ntiense Eno-Amooquaye and Abi Palmer - which have explored themes from climate crisis to materiality.
The Arts Fund noted how Chapter ""continues to co-create exceptional programmes that enrich Cardiff's cultural landscape"", from printmaking to music.
It offers ""pay what you can"" pricing and free community tickets, and also recently introduced an artist residency programme with free studio space, and launched Wales' largest festival of deaf-led creative activity, Deaf Gathering Cymru.
Compton Verney in Warwickshire has six art collections, a sculpture park and café, set within a Grade I-listed 18th Century mansion.
The gallery was described as ""a vibrant cultural destination committed to making art accessible to all by connecting people with art, nature, and creativity"".
Last year, it unveiled its Sculpture in the Park exhibition featuring works by artists such as Sarah Lucas, Permindar Kaur, Larry Achiampong, Helen Chadwick and Erika Verzutti.
The venue invites artists and communities to reimagine its 18th Century facade, and its exhibitions have also explored the legacies of the likes of Capability Brown, Louise Bourgeois and Chila Kumari Singh Burman.
More than 6,000 schoolchildren have visited and participated in early creative projects, while recent initiatives have also included a monthly dementia café and an upcoming large-scale multimedia exhibition of work, reflecting on life and death, by Emma Talbot (5 July-5 October).
The jury noted the museum's commitment to ""breaking down barriers to cultural careers for young people with disabilities.""
Contemporary arts space Golden Thread Gallery in Belfast features two large galleries, a community participation and engagement hub, and Northern Ireland's first visual art library and archive.
After closing in 2023, the gallery reopened last year at a new Queen Street address in the city centre, presenting exhibitions by artists including Charlotte Bosanquet, Rob Hilken, Graham Fagen, Susan Hiller and Claire Morgan.
Since reopening it has welcomed more than 23,000 visitors.
The gallery partnered with Translink NI to help produce a public sculpture by Kevin Killen incorporating local narratives and community stories at the redeveloped York Street station.
This summer it will host the video and photographic works of Sophie Calle with her exhibition Beyond the Gaze - Shared Perspectives (21 June-27 August).
Perth Museum serves as the new home of the Stone of Destiny, one of Scotland's most cherished treasures, which has returned to Perthshire after more than 700 years.
The civic museum opened last year following a £27 million development at the former Perth City Hall, by Dutch architects Mecanoo, enabling it to tell the story of Scottish history.
The Stone of Destiny experience uses immersive modern technology to frame the contested object within the story of the medieval boy king of Scotland, Alexander III.
A new exhibition exploring the history and legacy of Macbeth is now underway (25 April-31 August 2025).
The museum has been building partnerships with 10 primary schools, helping students, teachers and communities to connect with their heritage.
Since its opening, Perth Museum has attracted around 250,000 visitors, boosting the local economy.
The Art Fund is the national charity for museums and galleries.
The last time its main prize shortlist totally overlooked London - where many of the nation's biggest museums were historically located - was in 2021, when the award was ultimately won by Firstsite in Colchester, Essex.
Waldman added she hoped this year's award would ""inspire"" people to visit some ""remarkable places"" in their local region and help them ""discover the powerful role they can play in our lives.""
Whichever one of the five museums wins will succeed last year's winner, the Young V&A in London."
The UK puffin paradise drawing visitors from across the world,Huge numbers of visitors flock to RSPB Bempton Cliffs to see dolphins and seabirds during spring.,3 days ago,Hull & East Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdypeqynejo,"Every year, from April to July, thousands of puffins fly across the Atlantic and return to the same spot in Yorkshire.
At RSPB Bempton Cliffs on the east coast, 3,000 of the distinctive seabirds settle in the crags to breed.
The nature reserve welcomes visitors from across the region and as far afield as Australia and America.
Danielle Jackson, visitor experience manager at the site, says it is the perfect spot to see puffins.
""It is a spectacular area of the coastline,"" she says. ""When the puffins are back and the other seabirds, we do get a real uplift in visitors.
""It's what everyone wants to come and see. Everyone loves coming here and finding their puffin of the year or seeing a puffin for the first time.""
Puffins mate for life and return to the same nesting site every spring, so many visitors can spot the same pairs each year.
""If you've got a good reliable spot within the cliffs and you know you've seen that puffin year after year, you have the opportunity to come and see it again and again. So it's really fantastic to be able to spot that,"" Ms Jackson says.
""They are quite tricky to spot though. You have to search for them. They make you work for it but once you find them you feel like you've achieved something.
""I absolutely love that and I love how much people adore them.""
Unfortunately, the birds are an RSPB Red List species, meaning they are among the species most at risk and of highest conservation concern.
According to Ms Jackson, the UK has lost about a quarter of its puffins since 2000, and monitoring their numbers is tricky because of their elusive nature.
""They're a really hard one to be able to monitor but we've been keeping sort of an approximation on how many numbers there are since the millennium,"" says Ms Jackson.
""Some of the other seabirds, for example the kittiwakes, feed on the same food source as the puffin, so we monitor them and their productivity - how many chicks they raise out of their nest each year - and we can kind of get a guess at how the puffins are doing.""
The reasons for their decline are wide-ranging, but include overfishing, climate change and increased risk from non-native predators.
""There's a whole combination of things that could impact the puffin numbers,"" says Ms Jackson.
""So it's like you're fighting a battle on all fronts really. Then there's things that we can't really control much like bird flu that could have an impact on those puffin populations.
""It would be really heartbreaking if people come to Bempton and there weren't any puffins there. So it's definitely something that we're trying to keep an eye on.""
This year has seen a number of suspected bird flu cases across Yorkshire, including at North Cave Wetlands and at poultry farms in Easingwold and Bridlington, the town closest to Bempton Cliffs.
According to Ms Jackson, the disease has had an impact on seabird populations across the UK, especially among species such as the skua.
But the National Trust has said there are signs puffins in Northumberland are building an immunity to the disease.
It said in April that while rangers on the Farne Islands had collected almost 10,000 dead seabirds in 2022 and 2023 due to bird flu, all seabirds there remained free of the disease this year.
Bird flu has previously affected the gannet population at Bempton, they have fared a bit better but since 2023, says Ms Jackson.
As well as puffins and gannets, the site is also a popular location to spot seals and even dolphins from the accessible clifftop viewpoints.
""We've got amazing wildlife here,"" says Ms Jackson. ""We've got gannets, which are the biggest seabird you can see in the UK, and it's the only mainland colony here in England.
""It's a really special place for them but you also have things like dolphins that come past, there are seals as well, so the sea here is so productive, but there is a lot of wildlife around.
""On top of the cliff we've got things like barn owls, we had short-eared owls just recently, so it is a really special place for nature and wildlife.""
Of course, for many people puffins remain their favourite species to spot.
""People absolutely love them,"" says Ms Jackson. ""They just look cute. They've got a massive orange beak. There are some species of wildlife that people just love generally and I think puffins fall in into that category.
""They're known as the clown of the sea and when you see a group of puffins together it's called a little circus of puffins, so I think it all adds into the cuteness factor that people just absolutely love.""

Political and religious leaders welcome new Pope,Many figures from across the island of Ireland offer congratulations as Pope Leo XIV is elected.,5 days ago,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy90e0p4j32o,"The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has led tributes to Pope Leo XIV  from across the island of Ireland, describing him as ""calm, affable and approachable"".
The Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, said the new Pope was a ""friend of Ireland and no doubt the Augustinian communities at home will be delighted with the news"".
White smoke started billowing from the chimney on the Sistine Chapel in Rome shortly after 18:00 local time (17:00 BST) on Thursday, signalling that the voting process had concluded.
The new pope, American Robert Prevost, who will be known as Pope Leo XIV, appeared on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election on Thursday.
Archbishop Martin, along with Archbishops Dermot Farrell, Kieran O'Reilly and Francis Duffy, met the man who would become Pope in February.
""He came across as a humble and respectful listener, wanting to learn as much as possible about the Church in Ireland,"" Archbishop Martin said.
""Pope Leo's choice of name suggests that a commitment to Catholic social teaching will be a hallmark of his papacy. Please pray for him. Saint Peter intercede for him. Our Lady of Grace watch over him"", he added.
Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown said he had met the then Cardinal Robert Prevost in Rome last October.
He told BBC News NI that he found the new Pope to be a ""most amenable person"".
""He came on his own to meet me in the office, he sat and listened, asked intelligent questions, he knew his brief,"" Bishop McKeown said.
""I was very impressed by the courtesy with which I was met on that occasion.
""In the congregation for bishops I'm very small fry. He treated me with enormous respect and courtesy and I'm very impressed.""
Bishop of Down and Connor Alan McGuckian said he welcomed Pope Leo XIV's election ""with joy and gratitude"".
""In a world torn apart by conflict, war and confusion, he encourages us to be heralds of peace and unity.""
He encouraged all clergy, religious and laity across the diocese to offer prayers of thanksgiving for the new pontiff.
Two Church of Ireland archbishops also welcomed the Pope.
Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell said he wanted to ""pass on the good wishes of the Church of Ireland not only to Pope Leo but also to the bishops, priests and Catholic people of Ireland as they enter in closer communion and closer knowledge of their new Chief Shepherd"".
Archbishop of Dublin Michael Jackson said Pope Leo was ""in our prayers as he embarks upon his Godly task which is new to him and new to the world as the Bishop of Rome"".
First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Pope Leo XIV's election was a ""day of profound significance for Catholics in Ireland and worldwide"".
Posting on X, she said she hoped the new Pope would ""stand up for the marginalised and oppressed, champion peace, and lead with courage and compassion - just as his predecessor, Pope Francis, did"".
O'Neill also encouraged him to ""stand unwaveringly for the rights of the Palestinian people"".
Posting on X, Alliance leader Naomi Long offered her prayers for the Pope.
""His first words, a commitment to bridge building and unity hopefully indicate continuity of the legacy of Pope Francis,"" she said.
""May God bless him and guide him.""
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Claire Hanna said the new Pope takes on an important role ""at a time when the Church needs to reflect the needs of a changing world and values of a new generation"".
""Pope Francis led with humility, grace and decency, qualities that earned him the admiration of people of every faith and none,"" she added.
""I hope Pope Leo will continue in that spirit, offering leadership that is compassionate, courageous and grounded in service.""
Hanna said she also hoped Pope Leo XIV would not ""shy away from calling out injustice and inhumanity"", mentioning both Gaza and Ukraine.
Green Party leader Mal O'Hara said he hoped Pope Leo would ""build on the bold legacy of Pope Francis, speaking out against poverty, inequality and the climate emergency"".
""I also hope he will show moral courage in confronting genocide, defending the most vulnerable, and challenging outdated orthodoxy, especially on the rights of minority communities.""
Irish President Michael D Higgins offered his congratulations to the new Pope, describing it as an ""immensely significant moment"".
""I send Pope Leo my very best wishes as he begins his pontificate, and I welcome his statement that he is prepared to lead with compassion, wisdom, and an enduring commitment to the values of peace, justice, and human dignity,"" he said.
Higgins said Ireland enjoys a ""long-standing and deeply rooted connection with the Holy See"", and added Ireland was looking forward to ""maintaining and deepening that relationship with Pope Leo"".
Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin wished Pope Leo XIV ""every strength, good health, and the required spiritual guidance as he begins his mission of leading the Catholic Church at a time of challenge, building on the pastoral direction and achievements of Pope Francis"".
He added: ""On behalf of the government and the people of Ireland, I offer warm congratulations to Cardinal Robert Prevost on his election as Pope Leo XIV.
""The scenes of great joy and celebrations in St. Peter's Square are a reflection of the hopes and goodwill felt by people of the Catholic faith from all around the world towards the new pope.""
Tánaiste (Irish deputy PM) and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Harris said it was a ""momentous"" occasion for Catholics around the world.
""As tanaiste and on behalf of the government of Ireland, I extend our heartfelt congratulations and wish him every success for his pontificate.
""I have no doubt he will continue to build on the extraordinary legacy left behind by his predecessor, the late Pope Francis, who taught us all the importance of kindness and humanity."""
"Ten Tors: Rules, routes and safety measures",Thousands of teenagers will head to Dartmoor to take part in the Devon-based challenge.,6 days ago,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82l1360e0o,"Thousands of people will descend upon Dartmoor at the weekend to take part in the 63rd Ten Tors challenge.
The annual event, between 9 and 11 May, is usually attempted by 2,400 teenagers in 400 teams of six, and organisers said routes ranged between 35 and 55 miles (56 to 88km).
The challenge, organised by the British Army's Headquarters South West, involves teams navigating routes across the northern half of Dartmoor in under two days.
""Teams must be self-sufficient, carrying all they need to complete their route and stay out overnight safely,"" organisers said.
The Ten Tors challenge began back in the 1960s, when it was attended by 200 people.
The founders of the inaugural expedition were Lt Col Lionel Gregory, Major Parker and Capt Joyner following an adventure training exercise for young trainees on Dartmoor in 1959.
There are three formats for the challenge:
The teams are assigned one of 26 routes which requires them to visit at least 10 safety controls and checkpoints in the order given.
Organiser said each route had its ""own unique problems and combinations of tors"".
The teams are due to set off from Okehampton Camp at 07:00 BST on Saturday and can go no further than their eighth tor on the first day.
Teams must reach the finish line at Okehampton Camp at 17:00 on Sunday.
The Army Headquarters South West said the challenge was ""immensely tough"".
It said: ""Those teenagers taking part will trek unaided... and will encounter some of the toughest terrain and highest peaks in southern England.
""They will rely on their navigational skills, and carry all their food, water, bedding, tents and other essentials as they go.
""It is a feat they must complete as a team, and without any help from adults, and they'll remain entirely self-sufficient during their arduous expeditions, including camping out overnight on the moor.""
In 2024, challengers from Torquay Boys Grammar described ""tough times"" but said team work got them through.
One member said: ""It's the best thing for camaraderie you could ever do as friends. There were really, really tough times but we picked each other up... we got through it.""
Prior to the event, those participating must complete ""structured and progressive"" training, which includes four days of training on Dartmoor and two nights of wild camping.
Teams must follow their allocated route, which only specify which staffed locations must be visited and in what order.
It is up to teams to identify and navigate their own ways between them.
Each team must carry all its requirements for the challenge and must be completely self-contained. Outside assistance, including shops and public toilets, is forbidden.
The Army Headquarters South West said phones were not allowed, excluding one to be kept in a sealed bag for emergency use only.
It said medals would only be given to those who completed the challenge in the time allowed.
Alongside the main expedition, there is also the one-day Jubilee Challenge, which has been designed for young people with a range of physical, neurological or educational needs.
Up to 400 people can enter the Jubilee Challenge each year, which offers four different routes which range 7.5 and 15 miles (12 and 24 km).
The Jubilee Challenge begins on Saturday at 07:30 BST and ends at 17:00.
The Jubilee-Plus Challenge, which was launched in 2024, is aimed at young adults with special educational needs and disability who are capable of an overnight stay, but may find the entire Ten Tors challenge inaccessible, organisers added.
Establishments may enter up to two teams with a maximum of four participants per team to take part in the Jubilee-Plus Challenge 18-mile (29km) route, which organisers said was ""physically arduous and challenging"".
Each year hundreds of applications, exceeding the 400 teams limit, are made to Ten Tors organisers.
Any establishment such as schools, scout groups or clubs in the south-west of England can apply to enter teams and applications are made in September.
The organisers' selection committee meets at the end of September each year and a list of successful entries is published online.
Organisers said the 400 team-limit was agreed as there were ""many competing demands"" for Dartmoor's space and the limit existed to maintain the ""balance"".
They also said the limit was in place to retain a ""crucial aspect"" of the challenge, which it said was for teams to be ""alone on the moor and rely on their own resources"".
The Army Headquarters South West said safety was at the ""heart of the planning and execution"" of the challenge.
It said: ""It is an exercise which is meticulously planned... over many months in advance working closely with other key civilian organisations, such as Devon and Cornwall Police, the Met Office, St John's Ambulance and the Dartmoor Search and Rescue Group, who will provide almost 350 volunteers.
""For the vast majority of the young people taking part in Ten Tors, the event itself is the culmination of months of training designed by team managers to ensure they are fit enough to walk up to 40 miles [64km] in one day across Dartmoor, but, crucially, are also gelled as a team and proficient at navigating across the wilderness of the open moor.""
It said all teams carried a satellite tracker which would be monitored by staff in an operations room based at Okehampton.
Team managers are required to attend an Army briefing which focuses on the harsh extremes of Dartmoor's climate, with further briefings and kit checks one day prior to the event.
Organisers said a heightened fire-risk status would also be in effect during this year's expedition following a wildfire
Items including a torch, whistle and a compass must be carried by those taking part in the challenge.
A sleeping mat, sleeping bag, sun cream and base layers are also listed among the packing list.
Trousers must ""completely cover lower limbs"" to provide protection against sun and insects, with three-quarter length leggings ""prohibited"".
Waterproofs, a hat, emergency rations and a first aid pack are also included on the packing list.

GB Energy to be blocked from using slavery-linked solar,The government says it has listened to MPs who called for a ban on panels linked to slave labour.,23 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrg7pkzpxo,"Britain's state-owned energy company will not be allowed to use solar panels linked to Chinese slave labour, under changes to government plans.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will introduce an amendment to legislation to ensure there is no slavery in GB Energy's supply chains.
It comes after ministers rejected an amendment to a bill last month that would have prevented GB Energy spending money on solar panels where supply chains had ""credible evidence of modern slavery"".
The production of solar panels in China's Xinjiang region has been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims.
China has dominated the renewables market and up to 50% of the world's supply of polysilicon - a key component in solar panels – comes from the Xinjiang region.
It is a dilemma for the UK, which imports more than 40% of its solar PV from China, according to HMRC data.
Dozens of Labour MPs abstained in a vote on the amendment which was put forward by crossbench peer Lord Alton when the Great British Energy Bill was in the House of Lords.
A government source told the BBC since then ""there has been an acknowledgement of the argument that GB Energy should be an industry leader"".
There has already been praise from the international community for the U-turn. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, told the BBC: ""I really salute the UK government's decision.""
He said that the materials for green technology are important but ""should really be produced in a socially and environmentally acceptable way"".
Labour MPs who have been calling for the change are seeing it as a victory.
Acting Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said the amendment was a ""humiliating U-turn from Ed Miliband"".
In a post on X, he said this was a ""major blow"" for the government's targets on increasing renewable power.
Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader who has long campaigned for a tougher UK stance on China, said the government would have faced a large rebellion if it hadn't introduced this change.
""I hope and believe they are now seeing sense and realise it is a terrible situation to allow products that have been produced by slave labour,"" he told the BBC.
The text of the new amendment has not yet been published but the change will single out GB Energy's objectives and ensure slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in supply chains it uses.
But achieving this is likely to be difficult and has been a significant challenge for many industries sourcing from the region.
Previous reports by the BBC have uncovered the use of slave labour in the manufacture of cotton and solar panels for use in the UK – both of which had been previously denied by the Chinese government.
In 2023, the BBC reported that the British Army was using solar panels made by companies claimed to have a ""very high"" exposure to forced labour in China.
Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), told the BBC ""there's a problem right the way throughout the renewables sector with state-imposed forced labour in China"".
The government could consider banning the use of any solar panels from the Xinjiang region.
Asked how difficult it would be for the government to increase its use of renewables without buying solar panels from Chinese companies potentially exposed to slave labour, Mr de Pulford said: ""It's going to require a transition because China has such a dominance of the production of polysilicon and nearly 40% of that comes from Xinjiang and is connected in some way to these labour transfer schemes, so we're going to have to diversify.""
Government sources denied the change would have an impact on the government's net zero ambitions, insisting there was capacity in the solar panel supply chains.
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: ""No industry in the UK should rely on forced labour, and through Great British Energy we have a clear plan to build the supply chains needed to support a new era of clean homegrown power, bringing jobs and investment.
""We are working across government to tackle the issue of forced labour in solar supply chains, and the relaunched Solar Taskforce is focusing on developing supply chains that are resilient, sustainable and free from forced labour.
""Having listened carefully to the views of MPs and peers, we are considering how we can go further to help ensure Great British Energy is a sector leader in this area and will provide an update shortly."""
What genetics has taught us about race,"As US President Donald Trump takes aim at the Smithsonian Institution for ""anti-American ideology"", Adam Rutherford examines what the science of genetics has taught us about race.",20 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250417-biological-reality-what-genetics-has-taught-us-about-race,"As US President Donald Trump takes aim at the Smithsonian Institution for ""anti-American ideology"", Adam Rutherford examines what the science of genetics has taught us about race.
When scientists unveiled the first draft of the Human Genome Project 25 years ago, it seemed to deliver the final word on some antiquated myths about race. It provided definitive evidence that racial groupings have no biological basis. In fact, there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them. Race, it showed, is a social construct.
But despite that fundamental finding, which has only been reinforced as work on human genomes has continued, race and ethnicity are still often deployed to categorise human populations as distinct biological groups. These are views that can be found circulating in the pseudoscience on social media, but they also still creep into scientific research and  healthcare systems.
Comment & Analysis
Adam Rutherford is a lecturer in genetics at Univeristy College London in the UK, BBC Presenter and author of How to Argue with a Racist, which examines the history and science of notions of race. You can read more from him about how to debunk racist myths with science and facts here.
It is even more troubling when this thinking finds its way into the halls of government.
President Donald Trump and his administration have made no secret of his rejection of many aspects of the scientific worldview. Since returning to the White House, he has made sweeping cuts to science funding for biomedical and climate research, but in a recent Executive Order, Trump took aim at what most scientists now regard as biological reality.
Entitled ""Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History"", the Presidential order, signed by Trump, targeted an exhibition in the Smithsonian American Art Museum called ""The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture"".
The order is part of a broader attempt to shape American culture by eliminating ""improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology"" from the institute's museums. It states: ""Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn – not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.""
The exhibition itself is criticised in the text for promoting the idea that ""race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating 'race is a human invention'"". The order offers the exhibition as an example of a ""harmful and oppressive"" shift in the narrative portraying American values.
This is the point when people like me, a geneticist who specialises in the history of race science, get a little bit vexed.
The issue here is that the sentence cited from the Smithsonian is 100% correct. This is neither controversial in science nor history.
Human variation is, of course, very real. People are different, and we can see those differences in skin pigmentation, in hair colour and texture and in other physical characteristics. These differences cluster in locations around the world: people from the same region on average look more similar to each other than to people from other areas – so far, so obvious.
In the 18th Century, these traits were the primary determinants for a new fashion for categorising humans in supposedly scientific terms. The Swedish botanist Karl Linnaeus is legitimately credited as the father of modern biology, as he gave us the classification system we still use today: genus and species. Every living thing is named according to this system, for example the bacteria Escherichia coli, or the lion, Panthera leo, or Gorilla gorilla, which probably doesn't need explaining.
We are Homo sapiens – wise people. But in his foundational work Systemae Naturae, Linnaeus introduced another tier of classification for us, designated primarily by that most visible of human traits: pigmentation. Linnaeus gave us four types of human, lumped together by continental landmasses: Asiaticus – people with ""yellow skin"", and straight black hair; Americanus – indigenous Americans, with ""red skin"" also with straight black hair; Africanus – ""black skinned"" people with tight curls in their hair; and Europeaus – ""white skinned"" with blue eyes.
These designations are clearly absurd – none of the colours are accurate, even if you took the obviously incorrect view that millions of people share the same skin tones even within those categories. But the roots of the race designations we still use today are visible in these labels. Some of these terms have fallen out of social acceptability and are considered racist. But we still use ""black"" and ""white"" as descriptors for millions of people, none of whom really have either black or white skin.
Even if this colour scheme were true, Linnaeus' original descriptions only began with physical traits. What he included in later editions of Systemae Naturae, which became the basis for scientific racism, were portrayals of behaviours. Asiaticus were described as ""haughty, greedy and ruled by opinions"" while Americanus were labelled ""stubborn, zealous, regulated by customs"". Africanus women were denoted as being ""without shame"" while both sexes were said to be ""crafty, lazy, and governed by caprice"". He described Europaeus as ""gentle, acute, inventive, governed by laws"".
By any definition in any age, these assertions are racist and entirely incorrect.
Of course, in examining history, we must be wary of judging people from the past by our own standards. But as the foundational text of modern biology, introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed.
Over the next 200 years, many men would seek to refine these categories with new metrics, including pseudoscientific interpretations of craniometry, or skull measurements. They never settled on a definitive answer about how many races there are – none of the characteristics that were being used are immutable, nor exclusive to the people to whom they were supposedly essential. We call this ideology ""racial essentialism"". But all of the many schemes put white Europeans as superior to all others.
It was biologist Charles Darwin who first began to unpick these ideas, recognising in his 1871 book the Descent of Man that there was much more continuity in traits between people that had been designated as discrete races. By the beginning of the 20th Century, molecular biology had entered the stage, and the era of genetics would dismantle the biological concept of race.
By the time we began to look at how genes are shared in families and populations, we saw that similarities do indeed cluster in groups, but these groupings do not align with the longstanding attempts to classify the races. The true metric of human difference is at a genetic level. In the 20th Century, when we began to unravel our genomes, and observe how people are similar and different in our DNA, we saw that the terms in use for several centuries bore little meaningful relation to the underlying genetics.
Even though only a tiny percentage of our DNA differs between individuals, the genome is so large and complex that there is great diversity. Geneticists are still working to unravel how this alters people's health, for example. But those genetic differences do not delineate along the lines of what we call race. They follow ancestral lines, can differ by geographic location and can be traced through historic migration patterns.
What we now know is that there is more genetic diversity in people of recent African descent than in the rest of the world put together. Take two people, for example from Ethiopia and Namibia, and they will be more different to each other at a genetic level than either one of them is to a white European, or indeed a Japanese person, an Inuit or an Indian. This includes the genes that are involved in pigmentation.
Yet, for historical reasons, we continue to refer to both Ethiopians and Namibians under the race definition of ""black"". Or take African Americans, people largely descended from enslaved Africans brought to the New World: sequencing the genomes of Black Americans reveals echoes of the history of transatlantic slavery. They not only mixed genetic ancestry from the handful of West African countries from which their ancestors were taken, but also significant amounts of White European DNA. This reflects the fact that slave owners had sexual relationships – many of which would not have been consensual – with enslaved people.
Therefore, the simple categorisation of descendants of the enslaved as ""black"" similarly does not make biological sense. They are genetically diverse in themselves and different from the African ancestors from which they are descended. To lump them together makes no scientific sense.
So it is by consensus, usage and history that we continue to use the term ""black"". This is what we mean by a social construct. The concept of race has little utility as a biological taxonomy. But it is enormously important socially and culturally. Social constructs are how the world works: money and time are both socially constructed too. The value of a pound or dollar is applied by agreement against goods and services. Time passes unerringly, but hours and minutes are entirely arbitrary units.
So, while race is not biologically meaningful, it has biologically meaningful consequences. The impact of most diseases correlates with poverty. As people of ethnic minority ancestry tend to be in lower tiers of socio-economic status, diseases tend to affect them more severely. This is true across the board, but was exposed early on in the pandemic. Black, South Asian and in America Hispanic people were disproportionately infected with and died of Covid-19.
The media immediately began to search for a reason that reified a biological version of race, sometimes focusing on vitamin D metabolism, which is connected with melanin production, and has effects on viral infections. Some studies showed that lower levels of vitamin D did associate with susceptibility to covid infection among black people. But this is a correlation not a cause.
More like this:
• The people whose DNA held a secret
• Why you have viruses hiding in our DNA
• The mystery of the human genome’s dark matter
Underlying any slight differences in biology are much more potent causes: while so many of us were locked down, frontline NHS workers, people cleaning up our rubbish and driving our buses all were more likely to be from ethnic minorities. They simply had a higher risk of being exposed and so infected with the virus. Combine that with the fact that minority groups are more likely to live in multigenerational, dense urban housing, and the supposedly biological susceptibility fades.
This is why genetics has played such an important role in the dismantling of a scientific justification of race and understanding racism itself. And it's why the latest statement from Trump's White House is troubling many in the scientific community.
Trump frequently speaks about aspects of genetics to make political points. One view that he has expressed repeatedly is that some people, and predictably himself, are genetically superior. ""You have good genes, you know that, right?"" he said in September 2020 to a rally in Minnesota – a state that is more than 80% white. ""You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn't it, don't you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.""
Similarly, in the successful 2024 campaign, he denounced immigrants as having ""bad genes"". It's hard for someone who studies genes – and the strange and sometimes troubling history of genetics – to understand even what might constitute a ""bad"" or ""good"" gene.
Ours may be a pernicious history, but the trajectory of genetics has been one that tends towards progress, and equity for all, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.

Warmest day of year as UK temperature hits 24.9C,Temperatures reached a new high for the year on Tuesday - and are predicted to peak on Thursday.,29 Apr 2025,UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9yez3780o,"The UK saw its warmest day of the year on Tuesday with a peak of 24.9C (76.8F) recorded - and forecasters predicting that later this week could see the hottest start to May on record.
The highest temperatures were seen in Ross-on-Wye in the West Midlands and Trawscoed in the west of Wales - surpassing 2025's previous high of 24.5C recorded at St James's Park in London on Monday.
Forecasters say the current warm spell could see temperatures peak at 29C on the first day of the new month on Thursday, as many voters head to the polls for local elections in England.
High UV and pollen levels also likely. The weather will gradually cool over the bank holiday weekend, although it will stay dry and sunny for most.
The peak temperature in Scotland on Tuesday was 22.4C at Aboyne, while 22.2C was recorded at Derrylin in Northern Ireland.
They will widely be in the low to mid-twenties on Wednesday, with the hottest weather likely in the London area at 27C.
The last time this temperature was recorded in April was in 2018 in Cambridge.
On Thursday, it will get slightly cooler across Scotland and Northern Ireland, as temperatures drop to 13-16C.
But in the south of England, the heat will continue to build and likely result in the UK's warmest start to May on record at 29C.
This exceeds the previous 1 May record of 27.4C at Lossiemouth in 1990.
The warmer than average weather is coming in from southern Europe on a south or south-easterly wind.
With high pressure not changing significantly - or becoming blocked - through the week, strong sunshine also adds to further warming of the air in the UK.
But with increasing humidity on Thursday, there is also a risk of some heavy and possibly thundery showers breaking out across England and Wales.
Temperatures will gradually fall over the long weekend. However, it will stay dry in most areas, with lengthy sunny spells and light winds.
Northern Scotland and eastern parts of the UK are expected to see the cloudiest weather, especially on Sunday.
By Monday, temperatures will drop to between 12C and 17C across the UK - looking more like the average for early May.
It is not likely that this spell of warm weather will qualify as a heatwave.
This would need at least three consecutive days at or above the ""heatwave threshold,"" which varies depending on where you are in the UK.
It is not unusual to see this type of hot spell in the spring, and April can bring big swings in temperature.
But as our climate continues to warm, this type of spring heat is expected occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is the fastest-warming season in the UK.
Meanwhile, UV levels across most parts of the UK are expected to be high, except for northern Scotland where they will be moderate.
Some UV radiation is crucial for our wellbeing, enabling our skin to produce essential vitamin D, but too much can be dangerous.
UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells. Exposure has also been linked to eye problems.
You can also burn just as quickly when it is cloudy, and the sun is as strong this time of year as it is in August.
The NHS recommends spending time in the shade when the sun is strongest, using at least factor 30 sunscreen and reapplying it every two hours, and taking extra care with children.
High temperatures can also affect the body. To stay safe, the UK Health Security Agency recommends drinking plenty of fluids, staying cool indoors, and avoiding exercise during the hottest parts of the day."
Fears for wildlife as homes plan gets approval,Those living near a much-loved wildlife corridor express disappointment as a council is overruled.,2 May 2025,Birmingham & Black Country,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqmg5l7l3o,"Residents have expressed disappointment after their ""David and Goliath victory"" over a developer was overruled.
Long-running proposals to build dozens of homes on a wildlife corridor in Oldbury, West Midlands, have seen significant local objection due to concerns about wildlife, privacy and congestion.
Sandwell Council's planning committee had agreed with neighbours, rejecting an application by developer Countryside because of cancer-linked pollution from busier roads.
But last month, the planning inspectorate approved the plans, overruling the local authority and saying pollution levels would be 'well within limits"". The council said the decision was ""final"".
Countryside said it was pleased it had won its appeal, which was heard on 16 April, and promised it would keep neighbours updated.
""The site will see the delivery of 60 much-needed affordable homes alongside ecological improvements and employment opportunities for the local community,"" a spokesperson said.
""We will continue to engage with local residents as work commences over the coming weeks.""
But some locals have been left dismayed by the plans.
They say the century-old green space behind Titford Road is home to badgers, foxes and many species of birds, but it has long been eyed up by developers.
Phil Shakespeare, a resolution officer who has led several successful campaigns to save the green space, said it represented the end of the road.
""I'm absolutely devastated,"" he said. ""I feel sorry for the animals [and] I feel sorry for the residents, but more importantly I feel more sorry for the people who are going to buy these 60 homes.""
Mr Shakespeare cited Sandwell Council's reasoning for rejecting the original plans saying fumes from nearby busy roads would affect people living in and around the new estate.
The fine pollution particles of concern, known as particulate matter or PM2.5, have been linked to cancer, heart disease, asthma and low birth weight.
Angela, a resource manager for a local high school, said she had previously lived in a noisy neighbourhood and the wildlife corridor was the main reason for buying her house.
She spoke alongside her 11-year-old daughter Ava who is also concerned about pollution and animals losing their homes.
""To be here less than a year and find out this is what they're going to do is heart-breaking,"" the 49-year-old said.
""It's affected our mental health already and [the building] has not even started yet.""
Tess Pegg, 43, a local environmentalist, added: ""They're going to rip it apart and build homes [but] it's already a home to badgers, squirrels and a number of birds.
""I don't understand why they've got the right to do that when we're in the middle of a climate panic across the entire planet.""
Sandwell Council said it continued to acknowledge the concerns raised by local residents about this site.
But a spokesperson said: ""The Planning Inspectorate is independent and its decision is final.
""We will work with the developers to ensure compliance with the conditions attached to the decision.""

Volunteers celebrate breaking tree-planting record,The trees planted will benefit the ecosystem while reducing soil erosion and flooding.,26 Apr 2025,Gloucestershire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1w07pegno,"Volunteers are celebrating after breaking their own record for tree planting in a single season.
Each year, Stroud Valleys Project (SVP) in Gloucestershire plants trees to support national and regional environmental targets.
Founded in 1988, SVP works with communities and organisations throughout the district to improve green spaces and protect habitats.
In the 2022/23 season, the team planted 6,000 trees and hedgerow plants. The following year, they increased that number to 8,500 but between November 2024 and March 2025, they managed 19,139 trees.
""We're incredibly proud of all the trees we've planted throughout Stroud and the surrounding towns and villages,"" said Clare Mahdiyone, SVP's CEO.
""Not only have we exceeded our target, we think it's fair to say we absolutely smashed it.""
She credited project officer Stuart Roweth for helping the team reach their ambitious goal.
""Trees are fundamental to human life - they give off the air we need to breathe,"" said Mr Roweth.
""In this particular moment in time, it's even more important because we are suffering from a group of threats to human life and biodiversity and trees can help with that to some extent.
""Having said that - you can't just plant trees wherever you want. A woodland or hedgegrow can be really effective - but not in the wrong place,"" he explained.
Volunteers worked in all weather conditions, planting trees and hedgerows at sites including the Fromebridge canal development, two playing fields in Nailsworth, a community farm near Painswick, and land in Sapperton.
""We choose our trees with great care so they suit each specific ecosystem,"" Ms Mahdiyone added.
""We also plant plenty of hedgerow, which is vital for creating varied natural habitats and sustainable green corridors.""
SVP said the trees planted will help provide homes for birds, small mammals, and invertebrates, as well as reduce soil erosion, mitigate flooding, and capture carbon, contributing to climate resilience in the region.

China's alternative to charging electric cars,A new fully charged EV battery in five minutes – are China's swap stations the future of electric cars?,6 May 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250506-are-chinas-swap-stations-the-future-of-electric-cars,"China has been trialling battery swaps for electric cars for years. Are they a viable solution to range anxiety?
At a battery swap station near the Beijing Olympics Sports Centre, the owner of a Nio car watches as a fully charged battery is placed into his vehicle. The station's staff drive his car onto a platform with an integrated system which removes the depleted battery from beneath the car and loads it a fresh one. The whole process takes no more than five minutes.
Behind him, a few other customers wait in line under an overcast sky, the iconic Bird's Nest Olympic stadium not far in the distance. Outside the battery swap station, a slogan reads, ""Battery swap stations are equivalent to gas stations for electric vehicles"".
Battery swapping – which simply means changing out depleted electric vehicle (EV) batteries for fresh, recharged ones – is an alternative to charging batteries inside the vehicle, as is used for the vast majority of the world's electric cars.
While battery swap is still largely a nascent sector, China has the world's most developed model by far. While it's mainly used for larger vehicles – close to half of the electric heavy-duty trucks sold in China in 2023 were equipped with battery-swap technology – the country is also seriously experimenting with swaps for personal cars.
Chinese electric vehicle company Nio has now built over 3,300 battery swap stations in China, while Catl, China's (and the world's) largest EV battery producer, recently announced plans with oil giant Sinopec to build a ""battery-swapping ecosystem across the whole nation"".
Battery swapping can have some big advantages, in particular the lower amount of time it takes compared to recharging a battery while its inside a car. Still, it faces obstacles in China, which is also developing fast charging infrastructure at breakneck speed.
In fact, experts say that it may be in the countries which, unlike China, remain in the early stage of a switch to EVs that battery swaps prove most useful for supporting electric car uptake – especially when it comes to addressing range anxiety among drivers.
Especially during the early days of electric vehicles, they were difficult to promote on a large scale due to range anxiety, says Daizong Liu, East Asia director of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) in New York. A lack of charging facilities led to longer waiting times and interruptions during trips for EV users. Battery swap technology soon entered the field as a potential solution.
Although first tested and used more than a century ago before electric cars fell out of favour, in more recent decades battery swaps for electric cars were initially picked up by EV battery swap company Better Place, which was established in Israel in 2007. Operating in Denmark and Israel, it aimed to reduce the cost of batteries as well as reduce range anxiety and charging times, and received almost $1bn (£760m) in funding. But the company eventually went bankrupt in 2013, citing difficulties in consumer adoption and securing sufficient support from automakers, the Times of Israel reported at the time.
Just weeks after Better Place declared bankruptcy, Tesla's plans to launch its own 90 second battery swap service were widely reported, with initial swapping locations along routes between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Boston and Washington. But just two years later, it began phasing swapping out again, citing low market acceptance.
China's State Grid – the largest utility company in the world – began researching battery swaps for electric vehicles around 2006. It was seen as a way around a large-scale transformation of the power grid, as its reliance on pre-charged batteries meant charging could be done at more flexible times and places.
""After comprehensive consideration, China decided to have a route to do battery swaps,"" says Liu.
At the time, China had few electric vehicles on its roads; even a decade later it had only 500,000. By 2023, it had 16 million pure electric and six million more hybrid cars, with more than one in every three new car registrations that year electric or hybrid. It also had some 8.6 million charging points, over a third of them added in 2023 alone.
Plug-in battery cars have dominated EV growth in China, but by 2021 it had also built at least 900 battery swap stations. That same year, it officially launched a pilot battery swap scheme in 11 cities. These projects are now scaling quickly: in 2023, China added around 1,600 new battery swap stations, bringing the total to some 3,570 stations, according to Chinese government data.
However, not all EVs are capable of battery swapping – the stations must be compatible with the car's battery system, so only certain models that are designed for it can make the switch.
At present, battery swaps are most widely used by commercial vehicles such as taxis and logistics vehicles, not passenger cars. Several Chinese experts told the BBC that's because, in several ways, the battery swap model has proven to be less advantageous than simply charging.
In China, charging technology is constantly developing. Mainstream electric vehicles in China will support high-voltage fast charging of 800V and above by this year, according to one report. Major Chinese automakers such as BYD, Xpeng and Nio have now developed vehicles equipped with super-charging technology, which takes 15 minutes or so to charge batteries from 10% to about 80%. In March 2025, BYD announced a new charging system which it says can deliver 400km (250 miles) of range in five minutes of charging, making them twice as fast as Tesla's superchargers. BYD plans to roll out a network of 4,000 of these ""flash-charging"" stations across China.
By the end of 2026, over 13 million vehicles in China are expected to be equipped with high-voltage fast charging. ""Overall, range anxiety is decreasing,"" says Liu. The country accounted for almost two-thirds of the 17 million EVs sold globally in 2024, a surge driven by China's push to reduce dependence on imported oil and establish global leadership in green technologies.
The ownership question is another thing holding back battery swaps for private vehicles, both in China and elsewhere. Battery swaps inherently require car owners to relinquish ownership of a particular battery. If a car owner has just bought a new car and swaps its battery on the motorway, for example, they will very likely receive an older battery. Many car companies are aware of this issue, and some have adopted a business model of separating the car and the battery: consumers buy their cars without batteries, which they rent directly from the company.
But this business model requires automakers to own and manage a large number of batteries, tying up significant capital and increasing financial risk.
Popularising battery swap stations will also require automakers to accept a unified battery pack standard, so batteries can be interchanged more freely, says Jing Yang, director at the Asia-Pacific corporate ratings division of Fitch Ratings, a credit rating agency based in New York. Carmakers, however, are reluctant to do this, she says: mastering their own battery technologies is an important way for them to maintain industry influence.
And while battery swaps would appear to solve range anxiety, it currently isn't always the case. A Nio owner I meet at the battery swap station near the Beijing Olympic Sports Centre tells me that while the time to swap the battery itself is indeed very fast, the swap stations need to reliably have a fully charged battery and few people in line to avoid long wait times. Once, he says, when visiting the suburbs, he almost missed an important meeting back in the city because no fully charged batteries were available.
For commercial vehicles, such as heavy-duty trucks, taxis and buses, such problems are easier to solve. These vehicles often operate in more predictable patterns, with centralised management, fixed routes or designated service areas, making it easier to plan and coordinate battery swaps efficiently. Battery swapping heavy-duty trucks are currently being widely promoted in China through both government policies and private companies, says Lulu Xue, mobility lead at the China office of the World Resources Institute, a global non-profit.
""The purchase cost of battery electric heavy-duty trucks was very high when they were first introduced, and batteries accounted for a large part of it,"" she says. ""If the battery is separated from the vehicle and users only buy the vehicle body, the price is almost the same as the purchase cost of diesel trucks.""
The Chinese government has extended considerable financial assistance to battery swapping schemes. In its 2021 pilot programme, three of the 11 cities are primarily focusing on battery swapping for trucks. Some provinces in China have also provided substantial financial incentives for the advancement of battery swapping technology. In 2021, China's Hainan Province announced a one-time subsidy of 15% of the initial investment in equipment for battery swapping stations built and put into operation between 2021 and 2022.

China has been able to widely promote battery swap stations so quickly since it is home to the main lithium-ion battery manufacturers, and thus has a relatively inexpensive and abundant supply of batteries, according to Yihao Xie, a researcher on heavy-duty vehicles at the Washington-based International Council on Clean Transportation.
Using battery swaps for commercial vehicles also has its obstacles, however. Swap stations can occupy a large area, says Yang, and there tends to be a scarcity of land and power grid resources in the core areas where they are needed, which can constraint rapid expansion. ""At present, battery swap operators have tried to deepen cooperation with some traditional energy companies to obtain such core resources,"" she adds.
However, Liu points out that battery swap stations are a similar size to petrol stations, which can be easily repurposed to be battery swaps. The China National Petroleum Corporation, for example, has already built both charging and battery replacement facilities at some of its gas stations.
Some companies are also trying more specialised methods. Like many facilities in China, using land for battery swap stations requires approval and filing, making the entire cycle relatively long, and the land rent also increases the cost of the stations. To avoid these, some companies have developed mobile battery swap vehicles, says Xue, which have the added benefit of being able to charge batteries in locations with lower electricity prices, then swapping them in areas where on-site charging would be more costly or less feasible.
Liu notes that for commercial vehicles, battery ownership concerns are easier to manage, since companies can purchase batteries in bulk or rely on third-party providers. But the issue is still affecting how often at least some drivers of these vehicles use swap stations.
One taxi driver I speak to in Beijing has a taxi with both charging and battery swapping technology, meaning he can choose to charge or swap batteries. The taxi company he works for stipulates that drivers must use the battery swap mode at least once a month as part of a trial. ""If I get a good battery, I won't change it,"" he tells me. ""I will wait a month before changing it."" Using the battery swap service is also more expensive than charging, he adds.
Taxi drivers who get a battery with a poor battery life at the swap station sometimes quarrel with the staff, according to a worker I meet at a Beijing taxi swap station. ""If the driver gets a bad battery, some of them will yell at us. I tell them, yelling at us doesn't help, we're just here to swap the batteries. Some drivers even say they'll call the police – it's happened many times.""
Currently, says Xue, there is a clear business model in China for battery swaps for heavy-duty trucks, especially for intensive but short-distance uses such as in factories and mines.
Xie agrees. ""Battery-swapping in commercial vehicles, especially heavy-trucks, is still faster than the fastest charger technologies currently in the market,"" he says. ""Trucks carry batteries with much larger capacities and those are just slower to charge until much more powerful chargers become available."" These advantages are unlikely to weaken even as fast charging technology develops, he adds.

But there is another potential reason to develop battery swap stations: to use them as energy storage stations, say Liu and Xue. Due to the variable nature of renewables like solar and wind, which are booming in China, a huge amount of energy storage is needed to ensure the stability of the power grid. EV batteries, including those in battery swap stations, are one way of providing this, says Liu. Battery swap companies could use their batteries to earn the difference in electricity prices between peaks and troughs, he says.
Some battery swap operators are already eyeing up this opportunity, but so far no stations in China or elsewhere are used in this way. It could provide another big benefit though, says Xie: supporting the grid when local distribution grids are knocked out by extreme weather. One hundred battery swap stations would be equivalent to a 50MW energy storage power station, notes one industry report.
It's possible that battery swaps may only ever be a relatively niche offering in China, where both EVs and their charging infrastructure are now widespread. But other countries have struggled to adopt EVs, and battery swaps may in fact play their most useful role in countries where EVs are not yet popular, Xie says, especially as more Chinese EV manufacturers bring their products and technology abroad.
Battery swaps are already being explored outside China. India and several other South East Asian countries are developing battery swap technology for scooters and motorbikes, and in 2022 India announced a new battery swap policy to promote the sales of electric cars. In 2023, Taiwan-based battery swap company Gogoro announced a $2.5bn (£1.9bn) partnership with the Indian state of Maharashtra and local supplier Belrise to build smart battery-swapping and energy infrastructure. Kenya similarly announced a partnership with electric vehicle and battery swap company Spiro in 2023. Meanwhile, after trials with Uber in San Francisco in 2021, California battery-swapping start-up Ample now has partnerships to integrate its swap station technology with Netherlands-based carmaker Stellantis and Tokyo's EV infrastructure.
And battery swaps could still solve the range anxiety of some in China too. Growth in China's EV market is currently driven by plug-in hybrid models, Yang says, while growth of pure EV sales has slowed significantly – showing that the convenience of energy replenishment is still valued by EV drivers. Both battery swapping and fast charging promote demand for pure electric vehicles. It remains to be seen what the final balance of these two technologies will prove to work best.
As per the Nio slogan, battery swaps can be seen as a sort of ""gas station"" for EVs. Whether they can ever reach the scale of gas stations, or even of EV recharging stations remains to be seen.

Brazilian butt lift ads banned by UK regulator,"The ads used time-limited deals to ""irresponsibly pressurise"" customers into booking, says the Advertising Standards Authority.",16 Apr 2025,Health,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zdy7j42do,"Adverts from six companies selling liquid Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) have been banned in the UK for trivialising the risks and exploiting women's insecurities around body image.
All of them appeared on Facebook or Instagram and used time-limited deals to ""irresponsibly pressurise"" customers into booking, says the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
One ad, for example, tried to entice customers with an ""exclusive opportunity"" to get a ""perfect peachy look"".
Liquid BBLs involve injecting filler into the buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger or rounded.

The ASA says because of the risks involved, cosmetic surgery should be portrayed as a decision that needs time and thought, rather than urgency to book quickly and grab a deal.
Clinics must be socially responsible and should not trivialise procedures or play on consumers' insecurities, it says.
One ad said: ""Get the curves and contours you've always wanted with our safe and effective body filler treatments. Feel confident every step of the way! Safe, proven, and beautifully natural results.""
Another claimed a 0% infection rate at its sterile clinic, with minimal pain.
The ASA says liquid BBLs would carry some level of risk to the patient, such as infections.
It adds: ""Marketers must not suggest that happiness or wellbeing depends on conforming to a particular body shape or physical appearance.""
The advertising watchdog says it has been using AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.
Three of the clinics - Beautyjenics, Bomb Doll Aesthetics and Ccskinlondondubai -did not respond to the ASA's inquiries.
Rejuvenate Clinics said it has reviewed ASA guidance and will remove all references to time-limited offers and state in ads that the surgery is carried out by a medical professional with ultrasound, to minimise risks and enhance safety.
EME Aesthetics said all its clients are given a full consultation and are under no obligation to book any procedures, and it therefore considers that its ad had not pressured consumers or trivialised the risks of cosmetic procedures.
Dr Ducu said it will ensure it follows the ASA's rules and guidance, that the time-limited Black Friday offer was intended to provide consumers with an opportunity to access the company's services at a discounted rate, and it always encourages consumers to make informed decisions without pressure.

Who is Elon Musk and what is his net worth?,"It seems like not a day goes by without billionaire Elon Musk making headlines. Here's what we know about the boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX.",23 Apr 2025,Business,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61234231,"It seems like not a day goes by without billionaire Elon Musk making headlines.
The boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and has used his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics.
He has charged ahead with human brain chip trials at his firm Neuralink, with three patients currently with implants. He's also played with turning X into a super app and tried to cement his presence in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence, despite having warned it could lead to humanity's extinction.
And Mr Musk's reach has expanded further still, after Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election - in which the Tesla executive played a key but controversial role.
The president picked the self-proclaimed ""first buddy"" to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge - a nod to Musk's favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin).
Musk denied a ""hostile takeover"" as his agency, which is not an official government department, implemented cuts such as dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which distributes tens of billions of dollars' worth of overseas aid every year.
Experts have warned of a threat to global health following the move, which could see USAID staff slashed from about 10,000 to fewer than 300 globally.
And then another twist - Musk pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role at Doge after Tesla reported a 70% drop in profits.
His close association with Trump has led to protests and boycotts of Tesla cars globally, with some online using the moniker ""Swasticars"" to refer to them, following Musk's controversial arm gesture at a rally celebrating Trump's return to office.
Critics, including some historians, said it was a Nazi salute - but Musk has dismissed that, saying comparisons with Hitler were ""tired"" and ""dirty tricks"".
After bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 53-year-old serial entrepreneur kept the public captivated with his business antics - although his more recent interventions in politics have not been very popular in the UK or Germany.
In the UK, Musk accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being ""deeply complicit"" in grooming gang ""mass rapes in exchange for votes"" - while Sir Keir accused critics of ""spreading lies and misinformation"".
In Germany, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and urged Germans to back the party in forthcoming elections.
In the UK and Germany, 71% of people said they took a negative view of Musk, with 63% saying they don't think he has much knowledge of national issues, according to YouGov.
Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.
He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college.
In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire, his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was ""not a man who takes no for an answer"".
""The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home,"" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, ""I am the alpha in this relationship.""
After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the ""dotcom boom"" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (£1.2bn).
He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008.
The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse.
More recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022.
He dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business did not rely on advertising alone for income.
Mr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an ""everything app"" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $9.4bn, according to some estimates.
Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed ""the great X-odus"".
Reports suggest hate speechhas been growing under Mr Musk's X tenure, and some firms don't want to be associated with that.
He also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company before parting ways in 2018, and setting up his own company xAI ""to understand the true nature of the universe"" in 2023.
In February 2024, he sued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman, saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft.
A year later, Musk led a takeover bid which was firmly rejected by Altman, who suggested a $9.74bn counter-offer for X.
""I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,"" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk's wide-ranging interests. ""He very much leads by instinct.""
In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as ""a confrontational know-it-all"" with an ""abundant ego"". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker.
In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims.
Divorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults.
""If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,"" Mr Musk said in a TED interview in 2022. ""But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense.""
Those contradictions certainly haven't stopped him amassing a fortune.
According to Bloomberg's index tracking the wealth of the world's billionaires, Mr Musk is the richest of them all.
It estimates his current net worth to be around $379bn, with his fortune soaring alongside Tesla's share price following Trump's election victory.
That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits.
The shares plunged at the end of 2022, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered a lot of ground.
And throughout 2024 Mr Musk was locked in a legal battle over a $56bn pay package from Tesla with a Delaware judge rejecting his claim to it for a second time in December.
Judge Kathaleen McCormick called the pay-out an ""unfathomable sum"", and argued Mr Musk had influenced the company's board and shareholders - with 75% of them voting to back his pay deal in June.
Mr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company.
Mr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover.
""Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,"" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber.
For a long time Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself ""half-Democrat, half-Republican"", ""politically moderate"" and ""independent"".
He says he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and - reluctantly - Joe Biden, all of them Democrats.
But in recent years he's swung behind Donald Trump, who is a Republican.
Musk told media company the Daily Wire his transgender daughter was ""killed"" by transitioning, and that he ""vowed to destroy the woke mind virus"". He is now estranged from his daughter.
Musk officially endorsed Trump for a second term in 2024 after his attempted assassination and became one of the campaign's foremost backers and influencers.
He became critical of the Democrat party's stance on a number of issues, including the economy, immigration and gun control - decrying many of its policies as ""woke"".
Mr Musk also repeatedly claimed that freedom of speech, enshrined in the first amendment of the US Constitution, would be under threat with another Democrat government.
He appeared at several Republican rallies in the run-up to the election, raised millions to fund a political action committee to help re-elect Trump, and frequently voiced his support for Trump in posts on X.
Mr Musk's America Super PAC also ran a controversial $1m giveaway to voters in battleground states in the last weeks of the campaign.
It was far from his first political controversy.
He has shared controversial takes on X about issues facing countries worldwide, such as suggesting the UK was on the cusp of ""civil war"" amid violent unrest in August 2024.
While Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port.
In the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as ""fascist"".
In the past he has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla.
However, he has since moderated his views on climate change, tweeting it is ""real, just much slower than alarmists claim"".
Despite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures expressing concern about the supposed threat to humanity's future that super-intelligent AIs might pose.
He has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in ""not enough people"" being in the world.
Mr Musk has had 12 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and three with Shivon Zilis.
Following the birth of his twins with Ms Zilis, he tweeted: ""Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.""

'Wildfire sent years of work up in flames',A decade of conservation was wiped out in days when a wildfire ripped across the Glen Rosa valley.,28 Apr 2025,Glasgow & West Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crm31l4y87ko,"For years, conservationists have been working to bring native trees back to the spectacular Glen Rosa on the Isle of Arran.
But a decade of effort was wiped out in days when a wildfire ripped across the valley earlier this month.
""It was years of our work going up in flames,"" Kate Sampson, the National Trust for Scotland's senior ranger on Arran, told BBC Scotland News.
""We just have to start again.
""We've lost 10 years of conservation work and effort but we just have to pick ourselves up.""
The blaze began on Thursday 10 April and was not fully extinguished until the following Sunday.
By the time the fire was out it had destroyed 27,000 trees as well as killing hundreds of reptiles.
Much of the Glen Rosa valley was left looking like a charred and blackened moonscape, with little sign of the years of work from the National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for the area.
According to the trust, thousands of years ago the glen would have been a native woodland but it was left bare by human intervention such as grazing sheep and deer.
It has been trying to restore the woodlands by introducing downy birch, sessile oak, hazel, willow, aspen and alder as well as endangered tree species such as Arran whitebeam.
Then, two weeks ago, Ms Sampson could do nothing but watch as years of effort were destroyed.
She was at the scene within minutes of the blaze starting on grassland at the bottom of the valley.
""It was shooting up the hill really fast because of the dry conditions and the wind,"" she told BBC Scotland News.
""From then on in, it was disaster management.""
As well as firefighters, local volunteers worked around the clock to try to keep the wildfire under control.
Ms Sampson said: ""The moorland was so tinder-dry and we had so much dead bracken and Molinia grass, so it just spread really fast across the moorland.
""There wasn't much we could do to stop it.""
In the days after the fire, Ms Sampson and a group of naturalists surveyed the land to assess the potential impact of the wildlife.
""It's quite tough to see, it's not just the trees that are gone, all the wildlife in the glen has been devastated too,"" she said.
""We had a group come and we monitored the glen but instead of monitoring live animals we had to record dead bodies.
""We had 72 dead slow worms, 25 dead adders, countless frogs and lizards, all dead as well.""
As we walked through the valley, Ms Sampson discovered a live frog and long worm in among the scorched grass.
In the two weeks since the fire, she's only come across a handful of reptiles still alive.
""It's hard to know the long-term impacts but the ecology has been totally disrupted and it's going to take a long time for that to recover,"" she said.
Initial investigations have suggested the fire could have started when dry ground was ignited when sun shone through a discarded glass bottle but the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) has not confirmed a cause.
The SFRS had put a wildfire warning in place covering all of Scotland a week before the Glen Rosa blaze.
Ricky Donachie, the SFRS station commander for Arran, told the BBC the blaze was classed as a ""significant wildfire"".
""Over the wildfire warning period, which lasted from 3 - 9 April, our control rooms received over 5,000 calls,"" he said.
""Over 1,000 of them were for grassland and wildfire callouts, with 19 of them in the significant category. It shows the importance of heeding any warnings.""
Mr Donachie warned against lighting fires and barbeques in the countryside.
Despite the devastation to the conservation work in Glen Rosa, Ms Sampson remains positive.
""If we can get it restarted then we might be able to make this land more resilient to fire,"" she said.
""If we can establish really good woodlands here, it will not only have great benefits for wildlife and biodiversity but the woodland itself can act as a firebreak.""
Work to replant trees in the Glen Rosa valley has already begun and a fundraising appeal to help revitalise the area has so far raised £12,000.
This weekend, a group of almost 100 volunteers helped plant 6,000 trees.
Beside the beauty spot of the blue pool at Glen Rosa, a shoot from one of the newly-planted trees stands out on the blackened hillside.
""It's an Arran whitebeam plant."" Ms Sampson says.
""It's one of the rarest trees in the world and we only have them here on Arran. This can be our first tree of hope."""
The world's most surprising pollinators,New research is showing just how much plants and crops rely on a host of darkness-dwelling creepy crawlies.,17 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250416-where-bees-wont-go-how-cockroaches-bats-and-beetles-pollinate-the-worlds-plants-and-crops,"New research is showing just how much plants and crops rely on a host of darkness-dwelling creepy crawlies.
Think pollination, and you will likely picture a butterfly or bee flitting between flowers. But while these are indeed important pollinators, both the natural world and our food supplies rely on a host of other creatures, some of them decidedly less appealing.
Most of the world's 350,000 species of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for reproduction. Pollinators and their importance for ecosystems are increasingly in the spotlight in recent years due to the dramatic decline in their numbers. Birds, bats, bees, bumblebees and butterflies have all been affected, with some populations shrinking by 80% or more. The causes include habitat loss, pesticides and climate change.
And recent research has also shown that pollinator diversity is just as vital for ecosystems and cultivated plants as the sheer numbers of pollinators, and found that this diversity is on the decline for similar reasons.
Scientists estimate that 3-5% of fruit, vegetable and nut production is lost globally as a result of inadequate pollination, affecting the availability of healthy food and threatening human health.
From cockroaches and beetles to the tiny ""bees of the seas"", here are some of the most unexpected, and occasionally disconcerting, pollinators the world continues to rely on – even if we don't always see them.
Cockroaches are, in the words of one study, ""among Earth's most despised creatures"". But recent research suggests they play a beneficial and long overlooked role as plant pollinators – especially in the darker areas of forest often avoided by the world's more beloved bees and butterflies.
""Traditionally, pollination has been associated with bees, flies, moths and butterflies,"" says Kenji Suetsugu, a professor of biology at Kobe University in Japan. ""However, emerging studies reveal that unexpected visitors such as cockroaches can play significant roles under certain conditions.""
These ""alternative pollinators"", he adds, are often particularly important in environments where conventional pollinators are scarce, such as ""in dense, shaded understories where light is limited and typical pollinators are infrequent"".
In fact, a growing body of research suggests that cockroaches act as pollinators in a rich and varied range of ecosystems – a role that previously went mostly unnoticed by researchers, since the creatures are nocturnal and less obvious in their interactions with plants than bees. In recent years, cockroach pollination has been reported for plant species such as Clusia blattophila, which grows on rocky outcrops in French Guiana, and the rare and endangered Vincetoxicum hainanense in China, amongst others.
Suetsugu has studied the role of cockroaches in pollination in dense, evergreen forests on Yakushima Island, a lush, subtropical island off Japan. He was specifically interested in cockroach-assisted pollination of Balanophora tobiracola, a mushroom-shaped parasitic plant.
Since cockroaches are elusive and nocturnal, he used several tricks to better understand their interactions with this plant. For example, he set up a waterproof digital camera in front of one flowering plant which took photos of it in 50-second intervals from dusk till dawn for around three weeks. The resulting photographs – more than 34,000 shots – showed cockroaches visiting the flower at night. Suetsugu also captured cockroaches after they'd visited the plant to identify and count the pollen grains on their bodies.
To investigate how a single cockroach visit affected the plant's chance of setting fruit, he enclosed five of the plant's flowers with a fine mesh and opened it only for one visit by the Margattea satsumana cockroach (the most frequent cockroach visitor for this plant), then closed it again. He compared this with other treatments of the plant, such as covering the flowers with mesh for the entire flowering period, to exclude all pollinators.
The study, published in 2025, provides ""the first direct evidence of effective cockroach pollination"" in this type of plant, says Suetsugu. ""In the case of a single visit [by a cockroach], nearly 40% of flowers developed pollen tubes, a strong indicator of successful pollination.""
As soon as the first ever flowers unfurled from their buds in the early Cretaceous period, they were visited by pollinators. But those first soft landings on their petals weren't by bees or butterflies – instead, it's thought that the pioneers of pollination may have had six scuttling legs and tough, shiny shells. They were beetles.
Beetles remain important pollinators to this day, often visiting flowers with the most seemingly unpromising allure – little nectar, greenish flowers, and an overpowering, possibly putrid smell, a set of traits known as ""beetle pollination syndrome"".
Despite millions of years of evolution, beetles remain among the most frequent pollinators of primitive flowers which emerged among the dinosaurs, such as magnolias. And unlike the more well-known modern pollinators, many beetles like to operate at night, flying or crawling towards the warmth and delectable scent emitted by certain beetle-specialised flowers, such as lowiaceae orchids in Borneo which smell strongly of faeces – a favourite of dung beetles.
As they hover above wild tobacco flowers, hawkmoths unfurl their 8cm (3in)-long proboscis to drink up its nectar – among their favourite meals. As they do this, grains of pollen are also pulled – as if by magic – across air gaps of several millimetres or even centimetres.
Do slugs and snails pollinate?
(Credit: Kenji Suetsugu)
Suetsugu's research on overlooked pollinators in Japan may also help solve a 100-year-old mystery in the field of pollination studies: do slugs and snails pollinate?
The idea that slugs and snails can pollinate plants is frequently mentioned in textbooks, but ""robust evidence is surprisingly scarce"", says Suetsugu. This type of pollination, known as malacophily, sounds plausible: as slugs and snails glide over flowers, they pick up pollen and transfer it. However, given that snails and slugs eat flowers, it is unclear whether such visits ultimately help reproduction – or whether they gobble up the flowers before there is any chance of fruiting.
A 2019 study by Suetsugu found that a type of slug, Ambigolimax valentianus, transferred pollen via fine threads of viscous mucus after visiting flowers of the Rohdea japonica plant –but that this did not lead to fruiting.
This happens because, incredibly, moths collect so much static electricity whilst in flight that pollen is pulled through the air towards them. The fact that they don't need to touch flowers in order to pollinate them makes them very good pollinators.
The majority of pollination research has tended to focus on day-flying insects, but researchers are now probing what is happening at night.
In 2023, researchers from the University of Sussex, UK, discovered moths may even be more efficient pollinators than bees. The team studied both daytime and nocturnal pollinator visits to bramble plants, a widespread species across Europe which is important to pollinators for its pollen and nectar. While the study found that 83% of all visits were made in the day, and just 17% made under cover of darkness (almost exclusively by moths), it also found the moths were able to pollinate the flowers more quickly than their daytime counterparts.
The authors say nocturnal pollination is understudied. As moths have been shown to transport pollen from wide variety of plant species, further research is needed to fully appreciate the role they and other nocturnal insects play in pollinating, they say.
Another recent study from the University of Sheffield, UK, found moths account for a third of all urban pollination. However, a lack of native plant species and diversity of plant life in cities, coupled with scent-stifling air pollution, is still leaving moths struggling to find their next meal. Now, experts are warning of an ""alarming"" global decline in moth abundance and diversity.
There are ways we can help, though, such as planting white flowers, leaving patches of scrub, rough grass and brambles to grow and turning off lights at night. Night-time pollinators such as moths, it turns out, need protecting just as much as bees.
Bats are another oft-overlooked furry night-time pollinator. While most bats eat mainly insects, at least 500 plant species in the tropics and subtropics are pollinated largely by nectar-feeding bats. Scientists say that bat pollination (chiropterophily) could have advantages: their large size means they can transfer a lot of pollen at once, and they fly long distances compared with many other pollinators. However, the large size of bats can also make pollination by them energetically expensive for plants.
One example is the endangered greater long-eared bat, native to the south-western US and Mexico. It feeds mainly on the pollen and nectar of agave (used to make mezcal and tequila) and various cacti, hovering above the plants just like a hummingbird to feed. Along with the lesser long-nosed bat, it is the main pollinator of agave.
Like agave, the pale flowers these bats feed on are often long and bell-shaped, and many bats have evolved ways to reach the nectar at the bottom of them. An extreme example is the tube-lipped nectar bat, found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. The size of a mouse, it has a tongue more than one and a half times its body length – the longest tongue-to-body ratio of any mammal and is the sole pollinator of a plant with corolla tubes of matching length. While not in use, it stows this huge tongue down in its rib cage.
More like this:
• A wild 'freakosystem' has been born on Hawaii
• Elephants hate bees – here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers
• How bug poo can help reverse the soil crisis
In fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in keeping certain plants populations healthy, but also in pollinating crops for farmers. However, researchers have warned that bats' status as a long-overlooked pollinator means there is a lack of knowledge of how dependent crops are on bats for harvest yield and quality.
A 2020 study found, for example, that bats were the main pollinators of pitayas (dragon fruit), a major crop in central Mexico – and that when bats were excluded from pollinating this crop, yields decreased by 35%. Experts have also warned that decreased populations of bats could lead to a fall in agave abundance.
Bats also play an crucial ecological role worldwide for wild plants and crops as both seed dispersers and insect eaters. Pest control by bats has been found to support many crops around the world – from coffee in Costa Rica and cacao in Indonesia to rice in Thailand and cotton in the US – sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars in avoided losses.
Like many other pollinators, bats are being impacted by environmental change around the world, with researchers warning that these changes are putting the pollination services bat species provide at risk.
Despite their tiny, inconspicuous flowers, seagrasses are capable of reproducing with no help from animals. Turtle grass, for example, a seagrass which grows in shallow seas across the Caribbean, has miniscule, pollen-producing male flowers and female flowers which don't produce pollen. In coordinated cycles, the female flowers open, followed by male flowers, which release pollen into the tides after sunset.
A decade ago, it was widely believed this was the only way that seagrasses pollinated, with pollinating animals only visiting flowers that bloom in the open air. But in an experiment at an aquarium in Mexico in 2016, ecologist Brigitta van Tussenbroek from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and her colleagues showed marine crustaceans were in fact playing a role.
""At the onset of the night, many small organisms that were hiding during the day from predators started swimming around,"" she says. The majority were barely visible crustacean larvae, which approached the male flowers to feed on the energy-rich pollen embedded in ""a slimy and sticky substance"".
""Some of this substance and pollen attached to their body parts when they swim around, while also being tossed to-and-fro by the water movement,"" says van Tussenbroek. On the receiving end, the female flowers have ""tentacle-like stigmas which capture the small pollen-carrying organisms"", thus depositing the pollen grains.
Mostly, these invertebrates are at the whims of ocean currents, but when waters are calm, they are able to swim purposefully, she adds, earning these bugs the nickname ""the bees of the seas"".
""This was a complete surprise,"" says van Tussenbroek, and upended the belief that small free-moving fauna played no role at all in pollinating seagrass.
But perhaps even more surprising was the discovery in 2022 that tiny Baltic isopods help transport the pollen-like ""spermatia"" produced by red algae. Does it count as pollination if there is no pollen? The researchers call it ""animal-mediated fertilisation"" and ask what this means for our understanding of pollination, which is believed to have developed around 130 million years ago when flowering plants first appeared on land.
The discovery opens the possibility that these kinds of symbiotic interactions might have developed completely separately on land and in water – and that animal-mediated fertilisation may have emerged in the sea well before plants moved ashore.

"Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",More clean electricity was generated in 2024 but there was a rise in the amount of coal and gas burnt too.,8 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq80ygdd3zlo,"More than 40 percent of the world's electricity was generated without burning fossil fuels in 2024, according to a new report from think-tank Ember.
But carbon dioxide emissions, which warm the planet, have risen to an all time high, the report says, with hot weather pushing up the overall demand for power.
That meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.
Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.
""Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,"" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.
""Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.""
In a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.
Ember is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling.
But this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity.
Cheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.
China continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.
Though it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply – that's the same as powering the entire country of India.
Wind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.
The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.
The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.
That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.
According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.
This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.
In the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity."
Could Trump invoke another rarely-used law at the border?,"The Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to deploy the military to enforce laws on US soil, including arresting migrants.",21 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qwez9zz7jo,"On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring an emergency at the US southern border and directed his top officials to evaluate whether to invoke a rarely used 19th-century law in response to immigration concerns.
The Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.
US media report that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, who were tasked with the assessment, will announce their recommendations later this week.
Since returning to office, Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus, and border crossings have reached a quarter-century low. But the  statute could further expand the president's powers.
Here's what to know.
The 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US.
This includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters.
US presidents can invoke the law if they determine that ""unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion"" against the government make it ""impracticable to enforce"" US law ""by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings"".
Once invoked, troops could be tasked with a range of duties, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.
Because the Insurrection Act was written in broad terms, with little specific guidance on how and when the powers can be used, it gives presidents wide latitude in deciding when to mobilise military personnel for domestic operations.
Throughout his election campaign, Trump vowed to crackdown on illegal immigration, calling the southern border situation a ""national emergency"" that could be better tamed by invoking the 19th-century statute.
On his first day in office in January, he asked for ""recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807"".
The administration has already rolled out a series of sweeping measures targeting the border. These include a nationwide deportation sweep and the controversial move to transfer alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador - a decision now facing legal challenges.
This comes as US Border Patrol has recorded just 8,300 migrant apprehensions, marking the lowest number of border crossings since 2000.

The Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history.
Abraham Lincoln used it when the southern states rebelled during the US Civil War, and former President Ulysses S Grant invoked it against a wave of racist violence by the Ku Klux Klan after the war.
In the 20th century, former President Dwight D Eisenhower invoked it so the US Army would escort black students into their high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the state's governor refused to comply with a federal desegregation order.
More recently, it was used in 1992 when massive riots broke out in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Then-President George Bush sent in active-duty members of the Marines and Army as well as National Guard troops.
The US government has traditionally worked to limit the use of military force on American soil, especially against its own citizens.
The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was enacted to restrict the military from acting as domestic law enforcement. In times of unrest, states typically deploy the National Guard to help maintain order.
Since returning to office, Trump has expanded his authority by declaring national emergencies - a move that grants the presidency access to powers and resources that are normally restricted. He has used this authority to impose tariffs and, more controversially, to take action on immigration.
In March, following his emergency declaration at the border, Trump invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants he alleged were gang members.  Earlier this month, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked that effort.
If Trump chooses to invoke the Insurrection Act, it remains unclear what legal challenges he might face."
Council to spend £10m to decarbonise buildings,Twenty of Oxfordshire County Council's buildings will be adapted to cut carbon emissions.,13 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdxz003rmzo,"Finances have been approved for a £10m project to decarbonise buildings owned by Oxfordshire County Council.
Twenty buildings owned by the authority will have work done to put them on the ""pathway to net zero"".
At a council meeting on Friday it was agreed that the procurement process could start for the project.
The council estimates the programme will generate potential savings of 333 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Wantage Fire Station, Abingdon Fire Station, Berinsfield Library, Thornhill Park and Ride and Witney Resource Centre are among the buildings set to see decarbonisation works.
The project will include the electrification of heating systems, building fabric improvements, efficiency upgrades and the installation of electricity-generating technology.
The council has secured £360,000 of government funding for the project, which it has match funded with £10m.
A report on the programme said some of the work would need doing, even without decarbonisation.
It said: ""In 2023/24 the council's property accounted for approximately 35% of the emissions that need to be reduced to meet the carbon neutrality target by 2030.
""In addition, a reactive only maintenance approach has left much of the council's estate in very poor-quality condition, with many components past their expected working life and in need of replacement irrespective of the carbon neutrality target.""
The grant funding for the project needs to be spent by March 31, 2026.

Farmers urged to comply with rules on taking water,"The warning comes amid a large number of unlicensed water abstractions, says the Environment Agency.",8 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2my442l0o,"Farmers are being urged to ensure private springs, wells and boreholes are legally compliant to prevent potential environmental damage.
Farm inspectors were finding ""a lot of unlicensed abstraction"" in Devon and Cornwall during routine inspections and 70 enforcement actions were issued over two years as a result, said the Environment Agency (EA).
The warning comes as climate change and population growth mean there will be less available water with a greater demand for it in the future, said the EA.
By 2050, the amount of water available could be down by 10 to 15%, with some rivers seeing 50 to 80% less water during the summer months, it added.
The EA said the 70 actions it issued required farmers to install a meter to monitor how much water was being taken, and apply for a licence where ""it is clear"" one was needed.
""Abstracting water without the necessary licence or in breach of your licence conditions is an offence and could lead to enforcement action,"" said Lisa Best, agriculture team leader for the EA in Devon and Cornwall.
Anyone taking 706 cubic feet (20 cubic metres) of water a day or more is required to have an abstraction licence.
""Taking more water than you are permitted could impact other users and damage the environment,"" said Ms Best.

Swinney vows action on GP appointment 'lottery',Scotland's first minister says the NHS will be at the heart of his government's plans for the coming year.,8 days ago,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20xr0jk3wo,"NHS Scotland will deliver an extra 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries over the next year in a bid to end the 08:00 ""lottery"", First Minister John Swinney has pledged.
The SNP leader made the announcement as he unveiled his administration's programme for government 12 months ahead of the Holyrood election in May 2026.
As well as putting the NHS ""at the heart"" of the legislative and policy agenda, Swinney announced his government would permanently ban peak rail fares and end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains.
The BMA union, which represents Scotland's doctors, said it did not believe the extra 100,000 appointments promised in GP surgeries would end the 8am rush to book an appointment.
The Conservatives said Swinney's statement was ""more of the same"" while Labour said the first minister had failed to meet the challenges facing the country.
The programme for government sets out the policy and legislative goals for the next parliamentary year.
It is usually published after the summer recess, but Swinney moved the date this year to ""enable a full year to delivery"" before the Holyrood election.
He told MSPs at Holyrood that his plans amounted to a ""programme for a better Scotland"".
Swinney acknowledged the difficulty many face in getting GP appointments can cause ""deep frustration"" in what he said was ""described as the 8am lottery"".
He said the NHS would deliver an extra 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries focused on ""key risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and smoking"".
It is understood GPs will be given extra funding to allow them to bring in people with conditions such as high blood pressure or cholesterol problems for check-ups before they are feeling unwell enough to ask to see a doctor.
It is hoped this will help ease the demand for on-the-day appointments.
Dr Iain Morrison from the BMA said GP surgeries in Scotland currently offer about 650,000 appointments a week - so the extra 100,000 would add up to only around one working day of extra capacity in a year.
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, he said the ""enhanced service"" appointments for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease were welcome, but did not address the key issues.
The BMA wants the government to address a funding shortfall that they say leaves them unable to recruit new GPs to their practices.
""There is nothing left to give,"" Dr Morrison said. ""We need that investment direct into general practice in order to boost our staffing numbers to handle the record level of demand we are experiencing.""
Swinney's statement, coming just nine months after the last programme for government, was light on proposed legislation.
He instead spent time emphasising his government's record in government.
Among the new measures was a commitment to scrap peak rail fares on nationalised ScotRail trains.
A previous pilot scheme was axed by the government last year, with ministers citing low passenger numbers.
Swinney said the move would ""put more money in people's pockets and mean less CO2 is pumped into our skies"".
Ministers also say they will end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains, which has been in place since 2020.
It is to be replaced by ""regulations that focus restrictions more effectively on particular times and locations, similar to previous restrictions"".
Ahead of the announcement, Swinney faced questions on anti-social behaviour associated with a scheme giving everyone under the age of 22 a free bus pass.
The government confirmed it was working on a scheme to suspend, or potentially permanently remove, passes from those engaging in anti-social behaviour.
Swinney told MSPs child poverty and tackling cost-of-living pressures were also among his priorities.
It came after figures released in March showed the Scottish government had missed its legal targets for reducing child poverty.
The Scottish government announced in December that it would effectively offset the two-child benefit cap north of the border by April 2026, or earlier if possible.
The cap, introduced by the UK government in 2017, prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for more than two children, with a few exemptions.
Swinney said his government was ""on track"" to deliver payments to affected families by next year.
He said the government would publish a child poverty action plan for 2026 to 2031 ""to keep us on the journey to meet our poverty reduction targets for 2030"".
To help stimulate the economy, the first minster announced a six-point export plan ""to enable Scottish exporters to diversify and grow markets"".
He also said ministers would set up funds for research projects and start-ups.
The SNP leader said the Scottish government would increase funding to the Acorn carbon capture project beyond a previous £80m cap - if given the go-ahead by the UK government.
The programme for government includes a commitment not to introduce new income tax bands, or increase current rates, before the next election.
It also says ministers will bring forward a bill to regulate non-surgical procedures which are offered for ""cosmetic or lifestyle purposes"".
Last week the Scottish government said it would not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's election - sparking criticism from the Scottish Greens.
Ministers said there was not enough time to draw up a law which reflected the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman, and instead planned to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.
The government also confirmed it would not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term.
During his announcement, Swinney said the government was ""entirely committed"" to tackling misogyny.
He also said his ministers would work with the UK government to deliver a conversion therapy ban across Scotland, England and Wales.
Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay described the programme for government as ""flimsy"" and ""more of the same"".
He told MSPs that it ""would do little to restore public trust"".
Labour leader Anas Sarwar said billions of pounds of public money had been ""wasted by the SNP"" during its time in power, calling the announcement ""embarrassing"".
He added: ""This statement fails to meet the challenges or ambitions of the people of Scotland.""
Jonathan Roden, policy and public affairs manager at British Heart Foundation Scotland said: ""This is an important step to help people live longer, healthier lives.
""However around 730,000 people are living with heart and circulatory diseases in Scotland and this Programme for Government does not confirm the Scottish government's commitment to a new heart disease action plan, which runs out next year.""
John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said the government's plan ""lacks the scale and urgency needed to meet statutory targets never mind achieve the FM's ambition to eradicate child poverty altogether"".
The Poverty Alliance said the policy agenda ""doesn't go far enough"", while the STUC described it as ""bold on rhetoric but light on details and on cash"".
Stop Climate Chaos Scotland said the programme for government offered ""too little, too slowly"".
However, the Scottish Chamber of Commerce said it was a step ""in the right direction""."
Flood-hit rowing club's regatta sponsorship plea,A rowing club has a cash-flow crisis after floods saw the cancellation of last year's regatta.,10 Apr 2025,Hereford & Worcester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6884nwlz3o,"An appeal has gone out for sponsorship for a regatta after organisers hit a cash-flow crisis.
Evesham Rowing Club cancelled last year's event because of flooding, and it left the committee facing ""real business challenges"".
Organiser Tony Rowland said the annual event, held each May bank holiday weekend on the River Avon, was still going ahead but appealed for anyone who could sponsor a race to get in touch.
Other local events, including Hereford Pride and Light Night Worcester, have been cancelled this year because of the economic climate.
The two-day spectacle sees hundreds of rowing crews take part in races, competing in singles, doubles, fours and eights.
Last year, when flooding hit the river, the club had already paid for everything, Mr Rowland said.
""The tentage was up, the toilets were out, the platforms were built and the water just didn't go down.
""The currents were very fast because we'd had extraordinary levels of rainfall.""
This year, after a dry March, river levels are normal, but the club faces a different challenge.
""We have high business rates, high energy costs. Employment costs have gone up. It's all got to be found out of income to cover the costs - so we have had a cash-flow crisis,"" he said.
He explained cancelling a regatta meant the loss of money that would usually be used to run the club throughout the year.
He asked anyone who could volunteer or sponsor a race to get in touch with the club.
""We've been very lucky. People have been kind,"" he said. ""Any help is gratefully received.""
The event attracted about 600 to 700 people, he said, with the main regatta on 1,000m (1,093 yd) of river on the first day and a 500m (546.8 yd) sprint on day two.
""It's fast and furious. It's good fun,"" he added.
""Just come down watch the racing and buy a beer or non-alcoholic drink and watch some good sporting activity.""

Light installation will transform church interior,"The suspended light installation casts moving shadows, illuminating the church and forming halos.",19 Apr 2025,Northamptonshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq1ydq5vxo,"A church is set to be transformed by a new light installation as part of a public art programme.
Fermynwoods Contemporary Art, an educational art charity based in Northamptonshire, has brought Halo, an immersive work by Swiss-Danish artist Tobias Zehntner, to All Saints Church in Earls Barton.
First commissioned at the Abbaye de la Cambre in Belgium, Halo features a suspended lighting structure that casts shadows and glowing rings above the audience.
""This installation feels like the perfect expression of that sacred in-between,"" said Reverend Jenny Bland from All Saints.
""The light that is interconnected with church, evoking candles, halos, mystery, divinity.
""A space where we might glimpse or experience something greater than ourselves.""
The project forms part of Fermynwoods' Love + Light programme, which uses art to explore themes of climate awareness, interconnectedness and collective reflection.
Tobias Zehntner, the artist behind the piece, said: ""I'm really happy to find a church community that are willing to have an artwork that is running and moving throughout their regular church service and activities.""
A special church service will be held alongside the exhibition, encouraging interfaith and intercultural dialogue.
James Steventon, director of Fermynwoods, added: ""We are delighted to bring this special artwork to a special Northamptonshire church which is open to everyone.""
The installation is supported with funding from the Northamptonshire Community Foundation.
People can visit the installation between 19:00-21:00 BST and it will run until 29 April.

"Pope's Ireland visit came at difficult time, says Varadkar",Pope Francis met former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle in 2018 as part of a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland.,23 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgev984z47o,"Pope Francis's visit to Ireland in 2018 came at a time when relationships with the Catholic Church were ""quite difficult"", former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has said.
It was to be the first papal visit to Ireland for 39 years - Mr Varadkar said he was initially ""apprehensive"" ahead of a meeting with the late pontiff.
""We had just voted to legalise abortion earlier that year, and we'd brought in marriage equality a few years before that,"" Mr Varadkar said.
""We had a number of years where we were dealing with a number of scandals in relation to child abuse and institutions in relation to mother and baby homes.""
However, Mr Varadkar said that he found Pope Francis' approach to be ""pastoral first and doctrine second"".
During the visit, Pope Francis also met with Mr Varadkar's partner, Matthew Barrett.
""We were one of the first gay head of government couples to meet him and he was very happy to do that,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.
""I didn't really delve too much into LGBT issues, to be honest; there wasn't much time on the agenda.
""But, in the time after, he made some very positive and very welcome statements, and he spoke out against the criminalisation of gay and lesbian people around the world.""
""He said: 'We needed to respect human dignity and basic rights and standards for all people, including people who are gay or lesbian or trans, Mr Varadkar',"" the former taoiseach added.
""It was significant that he said trans men and women could be godparents.""
He praised Pope Francis for speaking publicly on behalf of migrants, adding that he found they had much in common.
""In that general approach of respecting individuals dignity and personal rights, on the issue of climate and on the issue of how we treat migrants and refugees, we would have been very aligned,"" Mr Varadkar said.
However, he said they ""didn't agree on everything"".
""He was very clear on his beliefs on the sanctity of life. While we agreed on being opposed to the death penalty, we had a very different position on abortion.""
On Tuesday, the Irish president said Pope Francis had ""unfinished business"" and that he hopes the next pope will build on the steps he was able to take during his tenure.
Michael D Higgins will be among world leaders and dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope Francis this weekend, along with his wife, Sabina.
After signing a book of condolences in Dublin, President Higgins said that, on behalf of the people of Ireland, he thanked Pope Francis for his work and his example on ""embracing the most important issues""."
The best spring birdwatching spots in Yorkshire,Some species return to Yorkshire in April after spending the winter in Africa.,19 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwvvj381l0o,"Birdwatchers have recommended the best locations in Yorkshire to spot migrating species arriving in the country this spring.
According to the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, late April is the ideal time to see cuckoos returning from Africa, and turtle doves, reed warblers and terns reappear in wetlands.
The region offers a diverse mix of nature reserves and habitats, including coastal areas, ancient woodland and moors.
Danni Burgess, from Otley, West Yorkshire, said spring was an ideal time to go birding, with longer days providing more opportunities to witness breeding and mating activity.
Ms Burgess, 40, said going birdwatching ""allows time to stand still"".
""It's such a lovely way to escape where you've just got all the time in the world just to be with nature,"" she added.
The self-employed childminder moved to Otley 13 years ago with her husband because she thought it was the ""perfect location"" for nature walks, photography and birdwatching.
""We've got some quite unique habitats, such as the moors and Ilkley, where there's lots of heather moors, which attract a lot of the breeding grounds for curlew and lapwings, which is quite unique for the UK.
""Another thing that I really like about Yorkshire is we have little pockets of ancient woodland as well, so that attracts quite a lot of migrant birds.""
Ms Burgess has been a birdwatcher for four years.
""It's quite exciting to see that crossover of birds arriving and then saying goodbye to the ones that you've spent the time with over the year.""
North Yorkshire
North York Moors National Park: The park's moorland makes for great nesting places for curlew, lapwings and black grouse.
Filey Dams Nature Reserve: The last remaining freshwater marsh is a magnet for migratory birds.
South Yorkshire
Sprotbrough Flash Nature Reserve: Near Doncaster on the north bank of the River Don, the area is a good spot for birds that favour wetland.
Graves Park: Sheffield's largest park has a variety of species, including ring-necked parakeets.
West Yorkshire
St Aidan's Nature Reserve: The former open cast mine is Ms Burgess' favourite because its wetland attracts rare birds like the black-necked grebe.
Eccup Reservoir:  More than 150 species have been recorded at the site near Alwoodley, on the outskirts of north Leeds.
Rodley Nature Reserve: A great spot for little grebes, tufted ducks and gadwalls.
Zap Coffey-Brittain, 52, who is a carer for his wife, has been birdwatching since his early teens and said he ""finds a great sense of wellbeing from being outdoors"".
The photographer, based in north Leeds, tries to capture images of species he has never seen before.
""This time of year is probably the more pleasant time of year to be doing things like this, especially as we have this gorgeous weather we've had so far in April 2025, which is really quite unusual,"" he added.
Spring migration is when birds travel to breed or access seasonal resources like food.
They typically migrate from Africa to the UK in the spring for cooler temperatures and fewer predators.
Some migrations can be short but many birds navigate along flyways - routes birds repeatedly follow - crossing oceans and continents.
They cover thousands of miles and use landmarks like rivers, coastlines or mountains to navigate.
Bad weather, predators or collision obstacles like skyscrapers with reflective glass walls can prove dangerous obstacles to migrating birds.
Nightjars will also be arriving late in the season, as well as swifts and Arctic terns due to their long journeys from Africa and the Arctic.

Can India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?,"After a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, India suspended a key water treaty with neighbouring Pakistan.",25 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vjyezypqo,"Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?
That's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's horrific attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.
The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.
The suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow ""will be considered as an Act of War"".
The treaty allocated the three eastern rivers – the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones – the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab – to Pakistan.
Disputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)
India, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.
Over the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.
But this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.
But what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?
Experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.
""The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,"" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.
Such hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.
Indian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.
Experts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.
""Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,"" said Mr Thakkar.
But challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.
After a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016, Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBC they would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.
Although there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.
Some experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.
""A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,"" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in the Dawn newspaper.
""That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.""
The treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.
Pradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.
The region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.
""India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,"" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.
Another issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can ""weaponise"" water against the downstream country.
This is often called a ""water bomb"", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.
Could India do that?
Experts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.
Himalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.
There's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.
In 2016, after India warned that ""blood and water cannot flow together"" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.
China, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad.
After building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.
Beijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow."
'Pope stood for what we thought church wouldn't',A same-sex couple have praised Pope Francis during a visit to Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.,22 Apr 2025,Liverpool,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvq5z65rngo,"A couple from Liverpool have told how Pope Francis was the most ""progressive"" Pope they have seen as they paid tribute to him following his death.
James Przystanski, 33, and Joseph Nze, 33, are both Catholic and are due to be married next year.
Joseph, who is from an Nigerian-Irish Catholic background, said: ""Pope Francis stood for everything that we thought the Catholic church would never go towards.""
The Pope's death on Easter Monday came only a day after he appeared in the Vatican's St Peter's Square to greet thousands of worshippers.
The first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church was discharged from hospital last month after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia.
The governing of the church  will now be handled by the College of Cardinals, its most senior officials, until the new Pope is chosen.
James and Joseph visited Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral, which opened its doors to allow people to pay their respects and sign a book of condolence.
""He was one of the best popes I've seen growing up,"" Joseph said.
""He made the church more worldly and open to other people, faiths and the LGBTQ community.""
Pope Francis once commented ""who am I to judge?"" when asked about his views on gay people.
And he roundly condemned countries that consider homosexuality a crime.
However, some critics have suggested the Pontiff could have gone further to encourage change in the Church's teachings.
James and Joseph visited the Vatican last year and have a strong faith, regularly attending church.
James said: ""We admired his work on climate change. There was no judgement from him, just acceptance.
""It doesn't matter - skin colour, sexual orientation. That's what I thought about him.""
""The fact he was making these changes in this world is what we need more so today more than ever.
""There's a lot of walls being built and he was breaking them down. Not segregation and integration - that's what he stood for.""
Others to sign the book of condolence included Arthur Siddall, a retired Anglican archdeacon from Garston in Liverpool.
Remembering Pope Francis, he said: ""I think he has brought a tremendous breath of fresh air and a wider vision.
""There are people out there really in need and you've got to get stuck in and do your stuff... that's how I see it and that's the breath of fresh air he's brought.""
Meanwhile Andrew Billington from Wigan said: ""I came just to say thanks to the People's pope - for all the time and dedication he's given to the common person.""
And Maureen Brennan, from Formby, said: ""I think Pope Francis has been a truly magnificent and humble man.
""He's just been a wonderful leader and shown us a lot of humility.""

Exploring Australia's 'magical' glow-in-the-dark world,"In Australia's Illawarra region, a ghostbusting-style night tour reveals ghost fungi, sea sparkles and tiny organisms lighting up the dark.",5 days ago,Travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250508-australias-mysterious-glowing-big-four,"In Australia's Illawarra region, a ghostbusting-style night tour reveals ghost fungi, sea sparkles and tiny creatures lighting up the dark.
On a slate-black night, I stare at a horizon freckled with stars. Only this isn't the sky, illuminated by hundreds of constellations; it's the muddy bank of a river, charged by a colony of glow worms.
""This is my TV,"" says David Finlay. ""It's magical, like something out of Avatar."" By day, Finlay works as a transport manager, but by night, he scours Australia's bushland and beaches chasing living light. ""If you're tucked up at home, you miss these things. Everybody cocoons themselves at night, whereas I think, what fun can I have?"" he says.
Bioluminescent creatures lurk in many corners of the world, but Australia's Illawarra region on New South Wales' south coast is a magnet for glowing phenomena. With low light pollution, ample rainfall and high humidity, it's an ideal microclimate for these creatures to thrive and trap prey.
Many are clustered along the Illawarra Escarpment, a sweep of sandstone cliffs, fringed with forests that roll into the Pacific Ocean. ""Our escarpment habitat is special. It's a well-preserved subtropical rainforest environment, which helps protect fragile bioluminescent life forms,"" says Finlay.
From his home in Kiama, Finlay can spot the ""big four"" within an hour's drive. There's sea sparkle, plankton that paints the ocean an electric blue; ghost fungi, mushrooms that radiate an eerie green; and glow worms and fireflies, which pierce the night-sky like tiny lanterns.
These natural phenomena are notoriously unpredictable and fickle to find, dictated by seasons, weather and light patterns. They are also extremely fragile, as mounting evidence shows bioluminescent creatures are waning with climate-change and human disturbance.
But for a growing number of glow seekers, who, like Finlay, visit with care, the challenge is part of the adventure.
When I meet Finlay at a clearing near Cascade Falls in Macquarie Pass National Park, it's only an hour past sunset, yet we're cloaked in darkness. It's Friday night, and while most people are under artificial lights, toasting to the end of the week, we're here to find natural shimmers in the night.
We trek through a path that cuts through the towering eucalypt trees, our head torches glowing red to cause minimal disturbance to wildlife. The full Moon pilots from above and the flow of the river whooshes us forward, guiding our footsteps towards the waterfall. ""If something flies straight past your face, it's probably just a micro bat,"" warns Finlay. ""They're very gentle, they're just looking for insects to eat.""
Cascade Falls has an ideal microclimate for glow worms and fireflies, he explains. Glow worms aren't worms – in Australia and New Zealand, they are the larvae of fungus gnat. Elsewhere in the world, the glow often comes from beetles. They hide in wet, dark places, such as dank caves, abandoned tunnels or thick rainforest.
Glow worms are endemic to Australia and New Zealand, and while many travellers visit iconic spots like Tamborine Mountain in Queensland, there are lesser-known colonies that can be discovered if you know where to look.
As my eyes adjust, I begin to notice more – the gnarled roots of a tree and a feathery mushroom cap. Finlay's vision is far better trained; he can easily spot silver spiders eyes blinking at us like cat's eyes on a motorway. He sweeps a UV torch across the floor, illuminating the undergrowth. A caterpillar glows fluorescent white, some lichen neon green, a leaf an aggressive shade of electric blue. ""Ah, that's just possum wee,"" he clarifies.
Finlay runs ad hoc glow tours (when available, he posts them on his Facebook page) in the Illawarra, showing locals and visitors the spectacle that most of us overlook at night. Last year, a few hundred places on his guided walks sold in a flash – as 25,000 people vied to secure a spot.
""For a lot of people, it's like finding gold, and nobody will tell you where they find the gold,"" says Finlay.
But it's a delicate balance between educating visitors and conserving these habitats. ""This national park is already impacted by people. I don't tell people about the really natural spots, as too many people would destroy those environments,"" he says.
More like this:
• The Indian Ocean's laid-back 'paradise on Earth'
• India's mysterious glowing forests
• How a fictitious 'sea' became a top Maldivian tourist attraction
Both fireflies and glow worms are incredibly sensitive, susceptible to habitat destruction from people, urbanisation and bush fires. The ""Black Summer"" bushfires of 2019-20 wiped out a ""horrific"" number of bioluminescent creatures, he says, with colonies impacted in national parks across Australia.
""I give people a list of dos and don'ts when they're out in the environment, and I tell them to teach other people this,"" says Finlay.
A golden rule, like almost everything in the natural world, is to look but not touch. ""So much as holding a glow worm in the palm of your hand will kill them,"" says Finlay. Bright flashing lights or even breathing too close can trigger them to shut down and disrupt their feeding patterns. We keep our voices low and hushed, and we tread carefully, making sure to move through the bush slowly.
For safety, Finlay suggests bringing a friend on a night adventure. He beams a laser pointer through the sky, tracing the kite-like constellation of the Southern Cross, in case I ever get lost and need to navigate my way south.
How to see glow worms responsibly:
We scramble down the embankment towards the mouth of the waterfall, following the tiny orbs of light. Tucked in the overhang of the river are dozens of glow worms, like a fairy grotto or twinkling Christmas light display. Up close, tendrils of silky web drip down, hanging like strings of pearls.
""Glow worms hide from sunlight, they'll crawl into nooks and crannies during the day, and when they come out at night, they have to rebuild their webs,"" says Finlay. Despite their beauty, these webs are death traps – snaring insects that are lured by glow-worm light.
Under the lens of the camera, the riverbank looks even more spectacular, with crystal droplets clustered around an iridescent light. It's clear why Bioluminescence Australia – a Facebook group with more than 64,000 members – has become so popular. The page was created to share photos of bioluminescent phytoplankton blooms, but it's also a message board for tracking down glowing phenomena.
Glow hunters follow a rough calendar – glow worms can generally be found year-round, whereas fireflies glimmer for a short window in Australia's late spring/summer (November to February). Elusive ghost mushrooms tend to fruit in autumn (March to May) when the temperature cools.
One of the most sought-after experiences is paddling through bioluminescence, or bio. ""Everybody wants to see it, and one of the reasons is that it's so Instagrammable. You can swish your feet through it and make sparkles,"" says Finlay. One of the best spots to see a ""blue tide"" in Australia is in Jervis Bay, further along the NSW south coast, or around Hobart in Tasmania.
Christine Dean Smith is a member of the group who has photographed sea sparkles for more than a decade. ""I hunt for bio because I have skin cancer and I'm banned from daylight,"" she says. ""Being a photographer, you tend to adjust yourself to finding nighttime nature to capture instead and then I show it to my followers.""
When we've spotted enough nature glowing, we retreat back through the bush to the clearing. Something flashes in my vision under Finlay's fluorescent torch – vivid, electric even; everything I've been told to keep my eyes peeled for. Maybe, I'm getting the hang of hunting for sparkles in the dark.
""Nope, just more possum wee,"" Finlay says.

The artichoke so prized that people sell fakes,"For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands – and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.",3 May 2025,Travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250502-the-artichoke-so-prized-that-people-sell-fakes,"For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands – and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.
The water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia Camerino steers her boat past the briccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible – to non-Venetians – lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as ""the vegetable garden of Venice"" for their lush, fertile ground – and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.
Camerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in the carciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as a castraùra. The castraùre are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are ""castrated"" off the plant – giving them their name – in order to allow the botoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.
Spring is a busy time of year for Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castraùra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.
""It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,"" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. ""It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat – not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castraùre are so tender that you can eat them raw.""
The castraùre's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto – this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like its terraferma counterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty – a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.
World's Table
BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.
It's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of an acqua alta (seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.
""It's very worrying,"" says Camerino. ""The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castraùre were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castraùra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castraùre could disappear.""
Because they're so delicate, the castraùre don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that ""understand the quality"" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castraùre ""because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castraùre so they can hike up the prices.""
How to try castraùre
• Plan a trip to Venice around mid-April to hit the height of the castraùre season.
• Always ring ahead to see if restaurants are serving them, since it's so dependent on the harvest.
• If you want to try preparing them at home, make sure you only buy artichokes with the consorzio's label – and don't be afraid to grill the seller about where they come from.
• If you miss the season, don't worry; you can buy a jar of violet artichokes preserved in oil from Finotello's farm on Sant'Erasmo.
• You can also get them in liquid form: the amaro digestif Venesian is made from Sant'Erasmo artichokes. Pick up a bottle to take home at the delicatessen Maramao, which sells local products from its canalside shop in the Cannaregio district.
Al Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castraùre when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years, rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: ""Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castraùre symbolise the richness of the land here.""
He prepares three castraùre dishes: a silky, gently sautéed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.
On Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castraùre that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farm I Sapori di Sant'Erasmo with his brother Claudio and is also the president of the Consorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.
""Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,"" Finotello explained. ""Or they will buy some castraùre but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.""
When the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist – but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castraùre from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.
More like this:
• Is the future of French cheese at stake?
• The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'
• Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food
I visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castraùre. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castraùra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised with scoasse (garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. ""We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,"" Finotello tells me, shrugging. ""We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.""
When he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castraùre he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. ""Now you need to eat some.""
At the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices of colomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike – and very chatty.
""Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!"" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. ""The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course."" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. ""The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!""

Politics fest to give 'sense of hope' - organisers,"Sheffield's Festival of Debate will run for six weeks at venues across the city, organisers say.",13 Apr 2025,South Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48v1dxeydo,"Two mayors of major northern English cities and the ex-leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn are among the big names expected to speak at a six-week politics event in Sheffield later this month.
The Festival of Debate, described by its organisers as the UK's biggest non-partisan politics festival, is due to run between 22 April to 30 May and is this year celebrating its 10th anniversary.
Among the issues being discussed would be climate change, health inequalities, poverty, sexism, racism and transgender issues, organisers said.
Nat Burton, from the festival, said it was hoped that those taking part would come away with ""a renewed sense of hope"" and ""the tools to make change"".
Ms Burton said: ""We've got a really diverse programme this year, ranging from big names in economics, politics and culture, to brilliant grassroots activists working tirelessly to make Sheffield a fairer and more equal city.""
As part of the festival, the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram are expected to talk about their new book, Head North, on 19 May at the University of Sheffield Octagon Centre.
According to the Local Democracy Service, the book discusses how the pair believe political and economic power can be spread throughout the UK in a push towards a fairer future.
Meanwhile, on 17 May at The Leadmill, Jeremy Corbyn, now an independent MP, is expected to discuss the Monstrous Anger of the Guns, a book he has co-authored examining the global arms trade.
An all-day session on 30 April involving senior Sheffield City Council officers and representatives from Sheffield Society of Architects, Friends of Sheffield Castle, Sheffield Civic Trust and Sheaf & Porter Rivers Trust will look at the Heart of the City project and what lessons could be applied to the transformation of the city's Castlegate area.
Other speakers included in this year's line-up would be authors Kate Raworth, Jason Hickel, John Harris, Lanre Bakare and Shon Faye, as well as Sheffield writer Désirée Reynolds, organisers said.
The festival would also feature panels, workshops and interactive sessions exploring alternative and emerging solutions to several big issues, with many of those events being free to attend.
Ms Burton said: ""We really hope people who attend this year's festival come away with a renewed sense of hope, as well as the tools to make change in their streets and in their neighbourhoods.""

How Katy Perry became the Hot and Cold popstar,"The US singer says she feels ""bruised"" after weeks of online backlash - what's sparked the change?",4 May 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynz85zj2vo,"Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a ""human Piñata"" after weeks of online backlash.
The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.
Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt ""so connected to love"", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: ""Can we send her back?""
Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.
It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an ""unhinged and unhealed"" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?



The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.
""Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,"" he says.
For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.
""That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,"" adds Cragg.

In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.
Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.
The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. ""Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,"" says Cragg.
""The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,"" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.
It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious ""purposeful pop"" era.
But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.
Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars – Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX – were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.
In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: ""I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.""
Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.
""The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,"" argues Cragg.
Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.
But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. ""I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,"" Cragg adds. ""Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,"" he says.
Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.
There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.
Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as ""unbelievable"".
The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.
""We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,"" it read.
""Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.""
It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Piñata remark acknowledging the backlash.
""I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,"" Diego tells BBC News.
He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.
But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because ""it's cool now"", he says. ""They don't understand how bad it could affect her.""
Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.
""There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,"" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.
So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.
""I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship."""
Toblerone dark chocolate bar discontinued in the UK,"Mondelēz International, which owns the brand, says it took the ""difficult decision"" to axe the 360g bar.",18 Apr 2025,UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4v0jy925vo,"The dark chocolate version of Toblerone's most popular bar has been discontinued after nearly six decades on confectionery shelves.
Food manufacturer Mondelēz International confirmed in a statement that its 360g dark chocolate bar would no longer be sold in the UK.
The company said it understood the ""difficult decision"" may be ""disappointing for some consumers"".
It attributed the discontinuation to ""changing tastes"" and growing its business, adding it ""continuously adapt[s]"" its range and ""continue[s] to invest in Toblerone"".
The original Toblerone bar was first invented in 1908, with a dark chocolate version - containing 50% cocoa - released in 1969.
Mondelēz did not indicate if its dark chocolate Toblerone was being discontinued elsewhere besides the UK, or if other sizes will also be discontinued. The BBC has approached the company for further comment.
The brand name Toblerone was created using the founder's surname, ""Tobler"" and the Italian word for a type of nougat made with honey and almonds - ""torrone"" - which the chocolate contains.
The Swiss chocolate bar's distinctive triangular shape is thought to have been inspired by the Matterhorn in the Alps - a silhouette of which appears on the packaging - though its true origins remain unclear.
A number of different versions have been released since it was first created, including a white chocolate version and a fruit and nut version.
The decision comes as the UK heads into the Easter bank holiday weekend, when chocolate sales are expected to be elevated.
But the industry has suffered from rising cocoa prices in recent years, reaching a record high in December, driven by a sharp fall in cocoa production.
The price of chocolate rose by 13.6% in the year to March, according to Office for National Statistics figures.
Last month, an investigation by Which? found that Easter egg prices in particular had risen by as much as 50% compared with the previous year, while chocolate sold in supermarkets in general had risen by 16.5% in the same period.
Claire Burnet, co-founder of Dorset-based premium chocolate company Chococo, said that the rising prices were ""driven primarily by poor harvests from the two biggest cocoa producing countries in the world that account for 60% of global cocoa production - Ghana and the Ivory Coast.""
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that there had been a ""perfect storm"" of ""ageing farmers, ageing trees, declining yields, increasing disease and then you overlay climate change issues on top of that"".
Crops in West Africa have been particularly affected by unusually dry weather in recent years."
Could an almighty eruption destroy a dreamy Greek island?,Scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the island's next big one could be.,21 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm25lz56rezo,"Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.
A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.
Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.
BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.
Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.
It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.
Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.
""It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,"" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.
This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.
Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a ""period of unrest"", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands ""swelled up"".
""Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,"" she says.
""We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,"" she says.
The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.
Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.
""We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,"" Isobel says.
The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.
Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.
They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.
So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.
""We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,"" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. ""We have to look inside the earth,"" she says.
The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.
The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.
The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.
She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.
""This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,"" she says.
It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.
These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.
John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.
""Don't pick that one up,"" he warns. ""It's full of arsenic.""
Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: ""This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.""
These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. ""This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,"" he says.
But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.
Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.
They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.
They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.
This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.
""We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,"" Paraskevi says.
The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.
Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.
""It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,"" she says.
She's back now but business is slower. ""People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,"" Eva says.
In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.
She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.
""I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,"" she said.
But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.
The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.
""Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,"" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side."
Hundreds of homes to get energy saving upgrades,A fund of £13.5m is available to spend on homes with poor energy efficiency ratings.,15 Apr 2025,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d270ddylo,"Hundreds of low-income households are to get thousands of pounds in a bid to make them warmer and cheaper to heat.
Bristol City Council has secured £13.5m of government funds to spend on about 300 to 350 homes which have poor energy efficiency ratings
The grants can be spent on measures like solar panels, heat pumps, new double glazing and better insulation to reduce energy bills.
Green Councillor Martin Fodor, said: ""It's just disappointing that we didn't get as much as we were actually encouraged to bid for.""
One out of seven Bristol households can not afford to keep their homes properly heated, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The council applied for £51m of funding from the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero, but was only given a quarter of that.
Around £20,000 will be spent on each property, which must have an Energy Performance Certificate within bands D to G.
Money will also go towards retrofitting homes in North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset.
Demand for grants is expected to exceed the cash available but the council has not decided on the selection criteria yet.
Mr Fodor, chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee, said it was ""really important to tackle fuel poverty"" and help people save energy.
""We have an excellent track record in Bristol and the work of City Leap to upgrade homes is important,"" he said.
""It's just disappointing that we didn't get as much as we were actually encouraged to bid for.""
The works will be carried out by Bristol City Leap, a partnership between the council and American firm Ameresco,

Wildfire warning over new controlled burning rules,Land managers will need to apply for a license ahead of the new muirburn season in September.,18 Apr 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7937vw40n3o,"New licensing rules for the controlled burning of heather and other moorland vegetation could lead to an increased risk of wildfires, a rural group has warned.
Scottish Land and Estates claimed the technical demands of a new muirburn licensing scheme will leave many land managers unable to obtain a license in time.
The Scottish government said land owners have been given ""adequate time"" to prepare for the new regulation.
The warning comes in the wake of a spate of wildfires across Scotland last week, including on the Isle of Arran and in Cumbernauld.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service issued extreme wildfire warnings last week during a period of warm and dry weather.
One method of preventing wildfires often undertaken by land owners is muirburn.
While the main purpose is to encourage new heather growth for grouse and other animals to feed on, it also gets rid of excess vegetation which can fuel wildfires.
However, the practice also has the potential to damage peatlands, which play an important climate role in locking up carbon, and can have a negative impact on other wildlife.
The Wildlife Management and Muirburn (Scotland) Act, will introduce a more rigorous licensing scheme this September, with muirburn on peatland only permitted in limited circumstances.
Ross Ewing from Scottish Land and Estates, said introducing the regulations was ""absolutely possible"" in the future but he said the current timescale and ""technical requirements"" could cause some land owners to stop the process all together.
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""I think its almost inevitable, if muirburn is made so much harder, which under the current direction of travel is absolutely going to be the case, there will be more wildfire incidents because there will be less people carrying out muirburn which means the fuel load will be increased in a larger area.
""What we are saying to ministers is this is not going to be workable within the timescales they've set out and that  they need to change their approach.
""If ministers make this too hard people will stop muirburning all together and with that your ability to combat wildfires become severely, severely curtailed.""
The group, which opposed the legislation before it was passed in parliament, said its concerns were shared by the Scottish Gamekeepers Association.
The Scottish government said it recognised the positive aspects of muirburn - but said land managers had been given plenty of time to prepare for the new rules.
A spokesperson said: ""The scheme will ensure muirburn is undertaken appropriately by trained individuals to minimise negative impacts on peatlands and other sensitive habitats.
""We recognise the importance of muirburn in creating firebreaks to help tackle wildfires and the new licensing scheme allows muirburn for the purpose of preventing wildfires.
""The Bill received Royal Assent in April last year and our implementation timescale has been designed to give practitioners adequate time to prepare for this licensing requirement ahead of the 2025/26 season."""
"Who is Pierre Poilievre, the Canadian conservative aiming to end Liberal era?",Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is seeking to bring the Liberal Party's nine years in power to an end.,27 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dpde9dxp0o,"At 20 years old, Pierre Poilievre already had a roadmap for Canada.
Canada's Conservative Party leader - now 45 - laid out a low-tax, small government vision for the country in an essay contest on what he would do as prime minister.
""A dollar left in the hands of consumers and investors is more productive than a dollar spent by a politician,"" he stated.
Poilievre is now one step closer to making his vision a reality, and even gave a nod to the essay in a recent interview with conservative psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson.
For Canadians frustrated with a sluggish economy and a housing and affordability crisis, Poilievre has promised a return to ""common sense politics"", and offered an alternative to what he labelled as former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ""authoritarian socialism"".
He now finds himself facing a different political foe, new Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney.
While Poilievre's Conservatives have enjoyed a large lead over the struggling Trudeau Liberals in national surveys for months, support for the Liberals has shot up following Trudeau's resignation.
Now the outcome of the general election is a significantly tighter race.
Still, Poilievre's message is resonating in parts of Canadian society, as his campaign continues to draw large crowds across the country.
Critics have painted him as a sort of Donald Trump ""light"" - a parallel that has become a liability amid Trump's trade war and musings about a ""51st state"".
Poilievre has sought to distance himself from the US president, positioning himself as a ""tough guy"" who can take on Trump, and has pointed to his modest upbringing as one of the differences.
Poilievre was born in Canada's western province of Alberta to a 16-year-old mother who put him up for adoption. He was taken in by two school teachers, who raised him in suburban Calgary.
""I have always believed that it is voluntary generosity among family and community that are the greatest social safety net that we can ever have,"" he told Maclean's Magazine in 2022, reflecting on his early life.
""That's kind of my starting point.""
As a teenager, Poilievre showed an early interest in politics, and canvassed for local conservatives.
Poilievre was studying international relations at the University of Calgary when he met Stockwell Day, who served as a cabinet minister under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
At the time, Day was seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance - a right-wing party with Alberta roots that became part of the modern-day Conservatives in a 2003 merger - and he tapped Poilievre to help with campus outreach.
""He impressed me from the start,"" Day told the BBC in an interview. ""He seemed to be a level-headed guy, but full of energy and able to catch people's attention.""
Day's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.
Poilievre went on to win a seat in Ottawa in 2004 at the age of 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time. He has held that seat since.
In Ottawa, Poilievre was given the nickname Skippy by peers and foes alike due to to his youthful enthusiasm and sharp tongue.
He built a reputation for being ""highly combative and partisan"", said Randy Besco, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto.
Behind the closed doors of Conservative caucus meetings, Poilievre showed his diplomatic side, Day said.
""Pierre was always good at saying, 'Okay, you know what? I hadn't thought of that,' or he would listen and say: 'Have you thought of this?'"" said Day.
Still, confrontational politics became a cornerstone of Poilievre's public persona. After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, he would target Trudeau with biting remarks as a way to connect with disaffected voters.
It has landed him in trouble at times. In April, he was expelled from the House of Commons for calling the former prime minister a ""wacko"".
Poilievre told the Montreal Gazette in June that he is a fan of ""straight talk"".
""I think when politesse is in conflict with the truth, I choose the truth,"" he said. ""I think we've been too polite for too long with our political class.""
His combative style has also been divisive, and he has been criticised for oversimplifying complex issues for political gain.
While Canadians have been open to the opposition leader's message as a change from Trudeau's brand of progressive politics, just under half of them hold an unfavourable opinion of him, according to a recent poll.
Poilievre has also had to shift his sights since Trudeau's resignation to get ahead of the inevitable match-up between him and Carney.
The Conservative leader has been described as a ""soft"" populist for his direct appeals to everyday Canadians and criticism of establishment elites, including corporate Canada.
It has been pointed out as a weakness by his critics, as the bulk of Canadians have become angry and frustrated with another well-known, nearby populist - Donald Trump.
Canadians priorities have shifted since the Trump administration launched a trade war against Canada, with the relationship between the two countries now the top of mind for voters.
It has forced Poilievre, who had not stepped much into foreign policy prior, to pivot. He has since pushed back at Trump's comments suggesting Canada become a 51st US state, vowing to ""put Canada first"".
""While Canadians are slow to anger and quick to forgive, once provoked, we fight back. And we will fight back,"" Poilievre has said in an address directed at Trump.
Trump has disparaged the Conservative leader in response, telling the UK magazine The Spectator that he is not ""MAGA enough."" In an interview with Fox News, Trump said that Poilievre is ""stupidly no friend of mine"".
On domestic issues, Poilievre has pledged to deliver ""the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history"", promising to keep repeat offenders behind bars.
He also came out in support of those who protested vaccine mandates during the 2021 ""Freedom Convoy"" demonstrations that gridlocked Ottawa for weeks.
On social matters, he has rarely weighed in - something Prof Besco said is typical of senior Conservatives, who see these topics as ""a losing issue"".
While Poilievre voted against legalising gay marriage in the early 2000s, he has recently said it will remain legal ""full stop"" if he is elected.
The Conservatives also do not support legislation to regulate abortion, though they allow MPs to vote freely on the issue.
""There will be no laws or other restrictions imposed on a woman's right to decide to do with her body as she wishes,"" Poilievre said in April. ""And that is something that I am guaranteeing to you and to all Canadians.""
Amid a public debate in Canada in recent months on immigration, the Conservative party has said it would tie levels of newcomers to the number of new homes built, and focus on bringing in skilled workers.
Poilievre's wife, Anaida, arrived in Canada as a child refugee from Caracas, Venezuela.
The Conservative leader has pushed for the integration of newcomers, saying Canada does not need to be a ""hyphenated society"".
One of his major promises - to cut the industrial carbon pricing programme, arguing it is a financial burden for families - has raised questions over how his government would tackle pressing issues like climate change.
Liberal leader Carney scrapped the unpopular consumer carbon tax this month, shortly after being sworn in.
Above all, Poilievre has said that he wants to do away with ""grandiosity"" and ""utopian wokesim"" that he believes has defined the Trudeau era, in favour of the ""the things that are grand and great about the common people"".
""I've been saying precisely the same thing this entire time,"" he told Mr Peterson."
Plans for new 20mph limits set to be approved,Westmorland and Furness Council says the reduction would reduce pollution and improve safety.,19 Apr 2025,Cumbria,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnwy6yv57o,"Plans to push ahead with the creation of new 20mph zones are due to take a step forward.
Documents published ahead of Westmorland and Furness Council's South Lakeland locality board meeting next week showed the authority had been recommended to approve plans to introduce reduced speed limits.
It would see the changes implemented in Gleaston, Great and Little Urswick, Natland, Oxenholme, Swarthmoor, Allithwaite, Ambleside, Coniston and Sedgwick.
In a public consultation on the proposals, all received more than 55% support, with 95.% of respondents in Gleaston backing the proposals.
The Lake District National Park Authority said it fully supported the proposals to reduce speed limits in Ambleside and Coniston.
In their response to the consultation, they said lowering the limits would make villages safer, ""including for vulnerable and disabled people"".
""They will make the villages a more pleasant place to dwell, encouraging spend within local businesses and they will encourage more active travel, helping to reduce carbon emissions and improve the health of residents and visitors,"" they added.
The 20mph speed limit policy was a priority set out by the council to tackle climate change, reports the Local Democracy Reporting service.
Council documents said: ""The main aims are to promote safer roads, reduce congestion, reduce vehicle pollution, enhance the environment for walking and cycling, and support the community having a sense of place.""
The council will make a decision at its meeting on 23 April.

UK investigating claims green fuel contains virgin palm oil,"The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a ""green"" diesel meant to cut emissions.",9 Apr 2025,Climate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24n8nej94o,"The UK government is investigating a fast-growing ""green fuel"" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.
HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.
But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.
And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.
Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.
In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they ""take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information"".
HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.
UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.
Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.
But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.
That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.
This palm oil ""floods the market like cancer,"" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.
They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.
Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.
""I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,"" they said.
""I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.""
As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.
The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.
EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.
But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.
This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.
""It's a very easy game,"" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is ""fake"".
""Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,"" he told BBC News.
""There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.""
Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.
It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.
But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.
""ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,"" said Dr Christian Bickert.
""They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.""
This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.
Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.
""We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,"" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.
The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.
In a statement they said ""there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority"", adding that the ""ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be"".
In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.
The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.
It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.
In response, the ISCC said it was ""more than surprised"" by the EU's move, adding that it had been ""a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years"".
""The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,"" it said.

"Flood works to protect town get £20,000 boost",Bunds will be built upstream of Witney to hold water back and prevent the town from being flooded.,21 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89gded15z8o,"Flood defences to protect a town are set to receive £20,000 in government funding.
Storm Bert caused chaos in Witney, Oxfordshire, in November with police closing Hailey Road through to Crawley Road, and reports of householders having to run to grab sandbags from a nearby school.
The funding is part of the government's £2.65bn investment in flood and coastal risk management, in a bid to protect 52,000 homes and properties.
The Witney Flood Alleviation Scheme is one of nearly 700 projects across the county that will receive part of the funding.
The scheme is an Environment Agency (EA) project that would involve several bunds being built upstream of the town to hold water back.
Caroline Douglass, executive director for flood and coastal risk management for the EA, said: ""The delivery of these schemes will be welcome news for homeowners and businesses, who have experienced flooding in the past and may face more extreme weather as our climate continues to change.""
Sensors have been installed at seven locations across the Windrush to analyse how the river behaves during flooding, after the Witney Flood Group were given funding by the county council and West Oxfordshire District Council.
Oxfordshire County Council also plans to grant funding for a number of small-scale flood schemes, such as reducing flooding from surface water run-off, ordinary watercourses and groundwater, between April 2025 and March 2026.
The deadline for councils and flood groups to express an interest is 18 April.

"Constance Marten's baby exposed to 'substantial' cold, jury hears","Marten and the baby's father, Mark Gordon, are in the middle of a retrial at the Old Bailey in London.",15 Apr 2025,UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89g0nep49lo,"Constance Marten's newborn baby would have been exposed to ""substantial climatic cold stress"" in the first few days she spent camping on the South Downs in January 2023, a jury has heard.
Professor George Havenith, an expert on clothing and cold exposure, told the jury that baby Victoria would have been at a ""substantial risk of hypothermia.""
Marten and the baby's father Mark Gordon are in the middle of a retrial at the Old Bailey in London.
They deny causing or allowing the death of a child and gross negligence manslaughter.
In their first trial they were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice by not reporting the death of their baby.
The court has heard that they went on the run after police found a placenta on the back seat of their car, which had caught fire on the M62.
After travelling by taxi from Liverpool, they spent two nights at hotels in Harwich and another night in a taxi driving from London to Newhaven in Sussex.
They then walked out onto the South Downs with a tent from Argos and two summer sleeping bags.
It was raining at the time and the temperature over the next few days was about 7.5C.
The baby's decomposing body was found in a plastic bag in a shed on a Brighton allotment almost two months later.
Prof Havenith told the jury he had conducted a number of experiments in a climate chamber at Loughborough University to recreate the conditions inside and outside the tent.
He said that the tent was a bit warmer than the outside air temperature: ""Inside the tent it gets up to five degrees (centigrade) higher than the outside,"" he said.
However, he said that with no mattresses, anyone lying on the floor of the tent would have been colder.
""The tent itself has virtually no insulation on the ground,"" he said.
He also conducted an experiment in which he asked two PhD students to sit inside the tent and found that within an hour they saw ""water running down the tent walls"", caused by the condensation of their breath.
Joel Smith KC, for the prosecution, asked if baby Victoria could have kept warm inside Constance Marten's coat if everything had remained dry.
""With a dry coat, dry clothing, dry sleeping bag, there would be just enough insulation to keep the baby safe,"" Professor Havenith said.
But then he was asked what would have happened if the clothing was wet.
""Baby Marten, in the conditions studied, especially where moisture was present In the clothing both in the tent and on the way to the South Downs, would have been exposed to substantial climatic cold stress which would have led to a substantial risk of hypothermia,"" he said, quoting from the conclusion of his report.
Mark Gordon and Constance Marten deny all charges.
Prof Havenith evidence continues.

"Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?",Pope Leo XIV has supported his predecessor and focus will turn on whether he continues Church reforms.,5 days ago,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln80lzk7ko,"Even before his name was announced from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, the crowds below were chanting ""Viva il Papa"" - Long live the Pope.
Robert Francis Prevost, 69, has become the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter and he will be known as Leo XIV.
He is the first American to fill the role of pope, although he is considered as much a cardinal from Latin America because of the many years he spent as a missionary in Peru.
Born in Chicago in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Leo served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982.
Although he moved to Peru three years later, he returned regularly to the US to serve as a priest and a prior in his home city.
He has Peruvian nationality and is fondly remembered as a figure who worked with marginalised communities and helped build bridges.
He spent 10 years as a local parish pastor and as a teacher at a seminary in Trujillo in north-western Peru.
In his first words as Pope, Leo spoke fondly of his predecessor Francis.
""We still hear in our ears the weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis who blessed us,"" he said.
""United and hand-in-hand with God, let us advance together,"" he told cheering crowds.
The Pope also spoke of his role in the Augustinian Order.
In 2014, Francis made him Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru.
He is well known to cardinals because of his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops which has the important task of selecting and supervising bishops.
He became archbishop in January 2023 and within a few months, Francis made him a cardinal.
The new pontiff was born in Chicago in 1955, and served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982.
Before becoming the new leader of the Catholic Church, Leo told Italian network Rai that he grew up in a family of immigrants.
""I was born in the United States... But my grandparents were all immigrants, French, Spanish... I was raised in a very Catholic family, both of my parents were very engaged in the parish,"" he said.
Although Leo was born in the US, the Vatican described him as the second pope from the Americas (Francis was from Argentina).
Jari Honora, a genealogist and historian in the US state of Louisiana, said Leo has strong ties to New Orleans' black community.
He told the BBC that the new pontiff's maternal grandparents lived in a now-demolished home in the city's seventh ward, and she also rented a place in the iconic Pontalba building in New Orleans' French Quarter.
Mr Honora said Pope Leo's grandparents are described as black or mulatto in historical records, but that the family's identity was listed as white when they moved to Chicago - a common practice among black families looking to escape racial segregation.
The Pope's background ""indicates that [American] stories, the experiences of our ancestors are more tightly woven than we could have ever imagined,"" he said.
""It shrinks that gap between Rome and New Orleans or New Orleans and Chicago.""
Early attention will focus on Leo XIV's pronouncements to see whether he will continue his predecessor's reforms in the Roman Catholic Church.
In choosing his papal name, Leo has signified a commitment to dynamic social issues, according to experts.
The first pontiff to use the name Leo, whose papacy ended in 461, met Attila the Hun and persuaded him not to attack Rome.
The last Pope Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903 and wrote an influential treatise on workers' rights.
Former Archbishop of Boston Seán Patrick O'Malley wrote on his blog that the new pontiff ""has chosen a name widely associated with the social justice legacy of Pope Leo XIII, who was pontiff at a time of epic upheaval in the world, the time of the industrial revolution, the beginning of Marxism, and widespread immigration"".
The new Pope's LGBT views are unclear, but some groups, including the conservative College of Cardinals, believe he may be less supportive than Francis.
Leo XIV has shown support for a declaration from Francis to permit blessings for same-sex couples and others in ""irregular situations"", although he has added that bishops must interpret such directives in accordance with local contexts and cultures.
Speaking last year about climate change, Cardinal Prevost said that it was time to move ""from words to action"".
He called on mankind to build a ""relationship of reciprocity"" with the environment.
And he has spoken about concrete measures at the Vatican, including the installation of solar panels and the adoption of electric vehicles.
Pope Leo XIV has supported Pope Francis' decision to allow women for the first time to join the Dicastery for Bishops, an administrative body that identifies and recommends future bishops to the Holy See.
""On several occasions we have seen that their point of view is an enrichment,"" he told Vatican News in 2023.
In 2024, he told the Catholic News Service that women's presence ""contributes significantly to the process of discernment in looking for who we hope are the best candidates to serve the Church in episcopal ministry"".
The new pontiff is believed to have shared Francis' views on migrants, the poor and the environment.
A former roommate of his, Reverend John Lydon, described Leo to the BBC as ""outgoing"", ""down to earth"" and ""very concerned with the poor"".
In recent months, he appears to have challenged the views of US Vice-President JD Vance.
A social media account in his name shared a social media post on X that was critical of the Trump administration's deportation of a US resident to El Salvador.
The account also shared a critical comment piece written about a TV interview by Vance.
""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others,"" read the post, repeating the headline from the commentary on the National Catholic Reporter website.
Shortly after, the account shared another article, published by The Jesuit Review, and commented that Catholics ""cannot support a rhetoric that demonizes immigrants as dangerously criminal simply because they have crossed the border in search of a better life for themselves and their families"".
The BBC has contacted the Vatican but has not independently confirmed the account, which was created in 2011, belongs to the new pontiff.
Leo moved to Peru as a missionary in 1985 to work in various rural communities.
He was known for working with marginalised people, and immersed himself in learning Spanish.
After a stint back in the United States, he returned to Peru again in 1988 to the city of Trujillo on the north coast where he trained young men to be priests and taught canon law.
In late 2014, when he was back in the US, he was put forward by Pope Francis to return to Peru as the Apostolic Administrator of Chiclayo, a diocese on Peru's north coast and the following year he was appointed the Bishop of Chiclayo. He served in this role for nearly a decade.
In 2015, he obtained Peruvian citizenship. He reportedly often referred to Peru as ""mi segunda patria"", my second homeland.
He championed various charities such as supporting soup kitchens and childcare for struggling families, and advocated for better housing on the north coast, which is prone to floods.
But not all in the country are proud of his record.
Accusations have been made about his handling of sexual abuse cases during his time as Bishop of Chiclayo. Three Peruvian women are among those who went public with claims that - as bishop - he failed to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing them, with claims dating back to 2007.
They said that when they raised their allegations with the diocese in 2022, no substantial or serious inquiry was opened.
Church officials denied this and said an investigation was opened, but was closed in 2023 by the ecclesiastical district and the Vatican after a local prosecutor said there was not enough evidence to support the civil claim.
An investigation by the prosecutor was reopened after media reports about the case and the BBC understands it is ongoing.
The BBC spoke in Chiclayo to Jesus Leon Angeles, who supports the parish where the accused priest works.
She said while the parish was ""in defence of women"", it was also ""in defence of the truth"" and claimed the allegations were part of a ""campaign"" against Leo when he became a cardinal in Rome.
These allegations and the continued fallout from sexual abuse scandals within the Church are one of the challenges he will face as he now leads Catholics worldwide.

Why Zelensky can't and won't give up Crimea,Ukraine's leader has ruled out recognising Russian control of the peninsula as part of a Trump peace plan.,24 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2x58m46e1o,"Vladimir Putin initially denied having anything to do with Russia's capture of Crimea in February 2014, when mysterious masked commandos in unidentified green uniforms seized the local parliament and fanned out across the peninsula.
Those ""little green men"" marked the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, which culminated in the 2022 full-scale invasion.
The future of Crimea is now at the centre of President Donald Trump's peace plan and has prompted Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to rule out recognising Russian control of the peninsula.
The exact terms of his plan have not been published, but reports suggest it would include the US recognising Crimea as a legal part of Russia - de jure in Latin.
For Trump, Ukraine's southern peninsula was ""lost years ago"" and ""is not even a part of discussion"" in peace talks.
But for Zelensky to renounce Crimea as an indivisible part of Ukraine would be unconscionable.
In the words of opposition MP Iryna Gerashchenko ""territorial integrity and sovereignty is a red line for Ukraine and Ukrainians"".
Trump made the point that ""if [Volodymyr Zelensky] wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?""
Few shots were fired, but Crimea was seized at gunpoint during a power vacuum.
Putin later admitted hatching the land-grab in an all-night meeting with his officials days after Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was ousted in Kyiv.
For a US leader in a hurry to secure a peace deal, Crimea could become a big stumbling block.
Trump is correct that there is little chance of Ukraine regaining Crimea in the foreseeable future, and it is in reality - de facto - under Russian control. But that is a far cry from recognising it as legal.
Zelensky points to a 2018 ""Crimea declaration"" by Trump's then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo said the US rejected ""Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea"" and pledged to continue until Ukraine's territorial integrity was restored.
Zelensky's implication is that Trump backed Ukraine on Crimea then, and should stick to that now.
If a landgrab unrecognised by the international community is approved by the US as legal, what would that mean for international law and the principles of the UN charter?
Weeks after Russia's full-scale war began, there was an initial proposal in Istanbul to park the issue so that Russia and Ukraine would aim to resolve it in the next 10-15 years.
The idea did not take hold but it was a way of getting over that stumbling block.
Zelensky was adamant that he has no power to give up Crimea: ""There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.""
Article 2 of the constitution states that Ukraine's sovereignty ""extends throughout its entire territory"" which ""within its present border is indivisible and inviolable"".
Any change to Ukraine's territory has to go to a national referendum, which must be authorised by the Ukrainian parliament.
It is not just President Trump that has problems with Kyiv. Russia also sees the Ukrainian constitution as an ""obstacle"" to peace efforts.
Constitutions can be changed, but not while Ukraine is under martial law.
Approving Russia's illegal annexation would not just be a red line for Ukraine but would be a terrifying precedent for countries such as Romania that border the Black Sea. The precedent would be felt far beyond the Black Sea.
For historical reasons, Russians have long seen Crimea as part of their territory and Putin has spoken of a ""living and unbreakable bond"" with the peninsula, with its Black Sea resorts and balmy summer climate.
But Crimea along with the rest of Ukraine voted for independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991. It had the status of autonomous republic within and Kyiv allowed Russia to lease the port of Sevastopol as a base for the Black Sea Fleet.
After its annexation in 2014 Putin sought to cement Russia's control over Crimea, first with a 12-mile bridge built over the Kerch Strait in 2018 and then by capturing a land bridge along the Sea of Azov coast in 2022.
Putin felt he was righting a wrong inflicted on Russia when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Russia, he said, was ""not simply robbed, it was plundered"".
Crimea was first annexed by Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great in 1783 and largely remained part of Russia until Khrushchev's decision.
Russia and Ukraine were both Soviet republics so it was not a big deal for the Kremlin in 1954.
More than half the population of Crimea was Russian, mainly because the original majority population of Crimean Tatars were deported under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1944.
Tatars were only able to return to Crimea from exile from 1989 as the Soviet Union fell apart, and they now make up about 15% of Crimea's population.
Russia quickly organised a referendum in March 2014 but it was rejected as a sham by the international community and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution backing Ukrainian sovereignty.
The International Criminal Court ruled that Russia's activity in Crimea amounted to ""ongoing occupation"".
Refat Chubarov, Chairman of the Mejlis, a body representing Crimean Tatars, has insisted that Ukraine must categorically reject any territorial concession in exchange for peace.
""Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine,"" he said.
Trump's peace plan has not yet been published, but according to various reports and remarks by US officials, Ukraine would be required to adhere to other difficult conditions.
Russia's occupation of almost 20% of Ukraine would be de facto recognised behind existing front lines, in effect freezing the conflict in four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.
That would be backed up by a ""robust security guarantee"", according to US outlet Axios, presumably backed up by a ""coalition of the willing"" involving the UK, France but not the US.
There would be a promise not to admit Ukraine into Nato, although it could join the EU.
All US sanctions would be lifted and economic co-operation with the US enhanced.
Axios also suggests Russia would return a small occupied area of the Kharkiv region and allow Ukraine ""unimpeded passage"" on the Dnipro river, while the US would take charge of the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, seized by Russia in 2022.
And then there is a US-Ukraine deal to share minerals profits, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is expected to seal with the US by Saturday."
It's only early April and north India is bracing for extreme heat,India's weather department has issued a yellow alert for parts for northern India until Wednesday.,7 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn741gg73o,"India's weather department has warned of high temperatures in parts of northern India, including capital Delhi, for this week.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said northern and central states - including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat - can expect maximum temperatures to cross 40C.
It has issued a yellow alert which means that the heat is tolerable for the general public but can cause moderate health concerns for infants, the elderly and people with chronic diseases.
Northern India usually sees heatwaves between April and June, but in recent years, global warming and climate change have caused extreme temperatures to arrive earlier and last longer.
According to the IMD forecast, the highest temperature in Delhi is expected to hit 41C on Monday afternoon. The average temperature for the city last year was 37C.
People have been advised to avoid heat exposure, wear lightweight and breathable cotton clothing and cover their heads with a cloth or umbrella outdoors.
The capital recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2C on Sunday.
Last week, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said most parts of India would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with above-normal temperatures expected across most of the country.
States like Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mr Mohapatra said.
""From April to June, most parts of north and east India, central India and the plains of north-west are expected to experience two-to-four more heatwave days than normal,"" he added.
Heatwaves usually start occurring in northern India from the end of April, but we are seeing that their occurrence has recently been exacerbated by climate change, says Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.
""We go straight from winter to summer; the spring season in northern India is shrinking,"" he said.
""In the coming days, we will see wind speeds slowing down with clear skies. This naturally leads to a rise in temperature,"" Mr Palawat added.
Last year, India recorded its hottest day ever at 50.5C in Rajasthan state. More than 40,000 suspected cases of heatstroke were also reported.
One weather station in Delhi in May recorded a maximum temperature of 52.9C, although the government later said it was due to a sensor error and revised it down by 3C.
Nearly 150 people died due to the heatwave in 2024, according to official data but independent researchers said the toll was much higher.

Moorland to be restored to its 'natural state',Keighley Habitat Bank will restore fields previously used for sheep grazing to their natural state.,14 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xxv5v6nyo,"An area of land on the edge of Ilkley Moor will become a ""habitat bank"" to conserve wildlife and attract new species.
The 140-acre Keighley Habitat Bank, between Silsden and Riddlesden, will restore fields previously used for sheep grazing to their natural state - with meadows, scrub and woodland.
The project is being run by Environment Bank, which sells land to developers to offset the environmental impact of their construction projects.
It said it hopes to create new habitats that support a variety of species found in the local moorland, including otters and badgers as well as nesting birds like curlew, cuckoo, lapwing, and grey partridge.
Two areas of mature Scots pine woodland within the habitat bank will be improved to encourage greater ecological connectivity across the landscape.
It will be managed using sustainable, low-intensity grazing techniques with sheep and cattle, mirroring traditional land stewardship practices, Environment Bank said.
Part of the habitat bank sits within flood zones along Holden Beck, providing an opportunity to enhance natural flood mitigation in the area, it added.
Cameron Chester, the senior ecologist leading on Keighley Habitat Bank, said: ""This is a really great site located at the edge of the beautiful Ilkley Moor. There are some really ecologically valuable habitats here already, including upland fen and waxcap grassland, and the opportunity to enhance those and the site as a whole is really exciting.""
Last year, biodiversity offsetting was introduced into the planning process across England.
To gain planning permission, developers must demonstrate a 10% net gain in biodiversity. This has led to schemes such as Environment Bank.
This project is designed to support both organisations that need to meet a statutory Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirement and those who want to contribute voluntarily.
The Keighley Habitat Bank is one of almost 40 BNG sites from Environment Bank's national network, created and managed by its team of ecologists in partnership with rural landowners.
It is due to be added to the national biodiversity gain sites register in September.

Can the mammoth be resurrected?,"From an Australian frog that swallowed its own eggs to woolly mammoths, scientists could soon bring back long-lost species from the dead.",8 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230113-how-extinct-animals-could-be-brought-back-from-the-dead,"From an Australian frog that swallowed its own eggs to woolly mammoths, scientists are getting ever closer to being able to bring long-lost species back from the dead.
Millions of years ago thylacines, also known as Tasmanian tigers, were widespread across Australia. About the size of an American coyote, these dog-like creatures with stripes disappeared from the mainland around 2,000 years ago. They remained in Tasmania until the 1920s, when they were slaughtered by European colonisers who saw them as a threat to livestock.
""It was a human-driven extinction – European settlers came to Australia and brutally obliterated this animal,"" says Andrew Pask, a geneticist at the University of Melbourne.
Pask is leading a team of scientists who, together with ""de-extinction"" company Colossal Biosciences, aim to recreate the wolf-like creature and bring it back.
Thanks to recent advances in genetics, namely the advent of gene editing technology Crispr-Cas9, the thylacine is not the only lost species that we could soon see again. How does the science of de-extinction work, and what kinds of ethical questions does it raise?
In the case of the thylacine, the first step is sequencing the extinct animal's DNA – the genetic blueprint contained in every single cell of the body. Pask did this in 2017.
""The great thing about the thylacine, is that as it was such an important marsupial every major museum wanted one in their collection, so there are hundreds of samples around the globe, and some are exceptionally preserved,"" says Pask.
""Our sample was a baby taken from its mothers' pouch. They shot the mum and immediately dropped the baby into alcohol, which preserves DNA. That was the miracle specimen and the holy grail for us in terms of being able to really build that genome.""
Although it's in pretty good condition, the DNA isn't completely whole. Over time, exposure to UV light and the action of bacteria break down DNA into short fragments. The older the sample, the smaller the fragments that are left behind, until eventually there isn't enough left (there's no chance of bringing back a dinosaur, for this reason).
This leaves scientists with the seemingly impossible task of working out how the various bits of DNA fit together – a task comparable to completing an enormous jigsaw without the helpful picture on the front of the box.
Luckily, a small mouse-sized marsupial called a dunnart was able to provide a blueprint.
""We found the closest living relative to the thylacine, which was the dunnart,"" says Pask.
Dunnarts and thylacines share 95% of their DNA, which is thought to be highly conserved, meaning it hasn't changed much over time.
""We sequenced the dunnart's genome and compared that genetic code to our extinct species, we then overlapped them and found everywhere where it was different,"" says Pask.
However, knowing an animal's DNA is simply not enough to bring it back. The next stage of the puzzle involves tweaking the genes of the dunnart so that they match the thylacine's. This can be done with Crispr-Cas9, the Nobel Prize-winning genome editing method.
Woolly wonder
Meet the ""woolly mouse"": a cute rodent with long golden woolly fur.
The genetically-engineered woolly mouse is the brainchild of ""de-extinction"" company Colossal Biosciences, which wants to resurrect the woolly mammoth using preserved scraps of DNA found frozen in Arctic tundra.
The company also announced in April 2025 that it had bred three young dire wolfs, an animal which went extinct over 10,000 years ago. However, experts have noted that the puppies have important biological differences to dire wolves, disputing the claim that the dire wolf has been brought back from extinction.
With help from Harvard researchers, Colossal Biosciences would like to eventually splice DNA from woolly mammoths into the genomes of Asian elephants to create a ""cold-resistant elephant"".
""We start with living cells from the dunnart, and we begin to edit all of those changes, so we essentially engineer or turn that dunnart cell into a living thylacine cell with thylacine chromosomes in it,"" says Pask.
Previously, gene editing wasn't advanced enough to be able to change all of the differing sequences to thylacine DNA in one go. With millions of edits needed, it was assumed that researchers would need to prioritise the most important DNA sequences, yielding an animal genome that wasn't exactly the same as the extinct one. Pask believes this will no longer be necessary.
""All of those technologies are in place, but nobody's done it on this scale before because the DNA-editing technology wasn't good enough or quick enough. But now it's come such a long way that we do have that tech, and we have had significant investment to try and make this work.""
Once the researchers have a thylacine cell, they still need to turn it into a developing embryo, and then implant it into a living close-relative's womb. If that sounds easy, then it isn't. ""We have a lot of work to do,"" says Pask.
""We've already made marsupial stem cells which took us about five years. We're now putting those stem cells into embryos to see if we can get them to develop into a whole living animal.""
What is Crispr?
Crispr-Cas9 was developed by the Nobel-prize winning scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A Doudna in 2012. The technology harnesses a set of genetic scissors that are part of a defence mechanism used by bacteria. When they encounter a potential viral threat, they copy and paste some of the attacker's DNA into their own genome to create genetic scissors that only slip that exact sequence. Its invention has transformed the speed and cost of edting genes, allowing scientists to accurately delete sections of DNA and create cuts where they can insert new genes.
It isn't just the thylacine that could be brought back this way. Preserved scraps of woolly mammoth DNA found frozen in Arctic tundra mean that this large mammal could return. Most woolly mammoths died out roughly 10,000 years ago.
Scientists at Colossal Laboratories and Bioscience – cofounded by researchers from Harvard University – are using Crispr to splice bits of mammoth DNA into the genome of the Asian elephant, the mammoth's closest living relative. The resulting hybrid, known as a ""mammophant'"", would be adapted to the cold Siberian tundra, and could help fill an ecological void left by the mammoth when they went extinct. (Watch a film from BBC Reel about how mammoths might be a surprising help in tackling climate change or watch it below.)
There are, however, limitations with the technology, and obstacles that still need to be overcome.
""Many attributes that we have as living animals require several different copies of genes, but it's not easy to tell from looking at a reconstructed genome how many are needed,"" says Michael Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
""You keep your fingers crossed that one copy will be sufficient to enable the feature you're looking for, but there's a big suck-it-and-see component to these projects.""
However, genome reconstruction is not the only method scientists could use to resurrect extinct animals.
The aurochs, a type of prehistoric cow, is the subject of ancient cave paintings around the globe. It once roamed the plains of Europe and stood as tall as an elephant. It became extinct in the 1600s. Although long gone, auroch genes can still be found in various breeds of cattle around the continent, with descendants in Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Balkans. Geneticists are now ""back breeding"" these species together to produce offspring closer to the qualities of an auroch.
Another idea is to essentially clone the dead animal by taking the nucleus from an intact cell, and then transferring it into the egg of a close living relative in the hope that an embryo will form.
The caveat is that you need a complete cell to do this, and cells quickly break down after death. An animal like the thylacine that died out almost a hundred years ago simply couldn't be brought back this way.
But it could be an option for recently extinct species.
In 2003, researchers successfully cloned a Pyrenean ibex, a type of goat that went extinct when the last living individual was killed by a falling tree. Sadly, the new-born died of a lung defect shortly after birth.
Archer is currently using a variation of cloning technology to bring back the southern gastric-brooding frog, a species native to Queensland, which became extinct in 1983. The creature had a bizarre method of reproduction, swallowing its fertilised eggs and using its stomach as a sort of womb.
In 2013, he completed the first step – transferring the nucleus from a frozen frog cell into the empty egg of a closely related amphibian. Incredibly the cells started dividing, and an embryo was formed.
""We did it many hundreds of times and it didn't work, and then suddenly one of them did and we saw this hybrid embryo start to divide under the microscope and it was very exciting,"" says Archer.
More like this:
• Why mammoths might be our climate saviours
• How mammals won the dinosaurs' world
• The grim fate that could be 'worse than extinction'
After this initial excitement, however, the project stumbled when none of the embryos developed into tadpoles or frogs.
""The frog embryos developed into a ball of cells, which is normal embryonic development, but then they stopped,"" says Archer.
""Normally the outside layer of cells folds in and you get a two-layered structure which leads to a tadpole, but ours didn't do that.""
The same thing happened when the team tried to create an embryo with two living species of frogs, suggesting that it was an aspect of their experimental work that was interfering with the development of the embryo, rather than a problem with the extinct frog's DNA.
""We're working to find out what this obstacle is in living frogs before we can go back to the extinct animal's DNA,"" says Archer.
Are we playing God?
Even if we can bring back extinct animals, there are ethical considerations.
Reintroducing mammoths and thylacines might upset existing ecosystems. Since these animals became extinct, others will have evolved and adapted to fill their place. Will these organisms suffer as a result?
Thanks to climate change, the environments these creatures once lived in may have changed drastically. Some of the plants woolly mammoths fed on are long gone as well. Would mammoths still be able to survive on their own in the wild, and if not, who would look after them? Would they just end up as curiosities in a zoo?
""I don't think we should bring all animals back. I think it should have to fit certain criteria,"" says Pask.
""For the thylacine it's a recent extinction event, so its habitat in Tasmania still exists, all the food it used to eat still exists, so there's somewhere for them to go and they can thrive again in that environment.
""This animal also played a critical role in the ecosystem. It was an apex predator so it sat right at the top of the food chain. There are no other marsupial apex predators so when it was made extinct it left a massive gap.""
Some researchers argue that efforts to bring back long-gone species could detract from conservation efforts to save existing animals and even increase the risk of biodiversity loss, and that people may be less incentivised to stop eating meat and destroying habitats.
But de-extinction technology could be used to save living species on the brink of extinction, especially those with an extremely small gene pool, like the white rhino.
Black headed ferrets are one of North America's most endangered animals – every ferret alive today can trace its ancestry to just seven individuals. Yet researchers at Santiago Zoo in Chile recently took frozen cells from a black footed ferret which died 30 years ago, and used them to create a clone, Elizabeth Ann. Elizabeth's DNA is entirely different, so she can bring a welcome boost of genetic diversity into the population.
""De-extinction tech isn't just about bringing back the thylacine, it's about preventing other animals from becoming extinct,"" says Pask.
""We have so many bush fires in Australia, and with rising global temperatures we are going to see more adverse weather events in the decades to come. What Australia has been doing is collecting tissues from marsupials in those areas that are most at risk and freezing them. This means that if a bush fire came along, once the vegetation grew back you could repopulate that area with that species.""
Archer agrees that the moral rights outweigh any wrongs.
""I think it would be unethical not to do it. I think the ethical issue here was the impropriety of humans making these animals extinct in the first place. It's not about playing God, this is about playing smart human by undoing what we did.""

City's street lights switched back on for safety,"In 2023, most of Newport's LED lights were switched off from midnight to 06:00 to save money.",17 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209e4qxqz1o,"Half of a city's street lights will be switched back on after shift workers said they felt unsafe at night.
Many of Newport's lights were switched off in 2023 to save money, but the city's council has changed its mind, saying safety was a priority.
However, some councillors have expressed concerns about the cost and impact on the environment.
The council added it could take up to 15 months to restore the lights, as new equipment needed to be installed.
Newport council began reducing street light operating hours in 2012.
As part of its 2023-24 budget, the council switched off 19,000 LED lights from midnight to 06:00, excluding the city centre and key highway safety areas.
Before that, every other LED light across the city was turned off during those hours.
Under the new plan, the council will install light-sensitive cells on thousands of lampposts at an initial cost of £320,000, with annual energy costs projected at £139,000.
Councillor and cabinet member for infrastructure, Rhian Howells, acknowledged that while turning the lights back on came with financial and environmental costs, she said residents feeling safe was the council's top priority.
Council leader Dimitri Batrouni said the decision shows the local authority stood with its workers.
He also noted that while smart lighting technology was still in its early stages, it represented a promising future the council is keen to explore.
Another councillor, Laura Lacey added past financial pressures left the council with little choice but to switch off the lights, but she now fully supported the new policy as the funding was available.
Cabinet member for climate change, Yvonne Forsey expressed concern that switching the streetlights back on could impact the city's environmental goals.
She said she hoped the council could adopt new smart light technology, which responds to movement and switch on when pedestrians approach."
Health minister rejects hospital review findings,"The minister says he rejected the majority of the review's recommendations as ""unnecessary"".",14 Apr 2025,Jersey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7x2ryr832o,"More than half of the recommendations from a review of plans for Jersey's new healthcare facilities have been rejected by the health minister.
Deputy Tom Binet thanked the Hospital Review Panel for issuing its report, published in February, but said it contained ""inaccuracies and certain claims that may have caused unnecessary alarm for the public"".
He has rejected 11 of the 20 recommendations, partially accepted seven and fully accepted two. Some of the rejected recommendations include calls for greater transparency regarding cost, funding and the project's value for money.
Review panel leader Jonathan Renouf said he rejected the criticisms and the panel used guidance from the minister.
Binet said the 11 recommendations he rejected were ""completely unnecessary"", and the nine he has accepted were part of work that was already happening.
He said: ""From an objective point of view, if there had been no scrutiny carried out on this at all, we'd be no worse off; we would have saved a lot of time... I don't think it has been a very useful exercise"".
He criticised some of the professional assessment in the review and said it was carried out as if the plans for Jersey were ""an NHS project, within the wider NHS context"", instead of a local project.
Binet also responded to the panel's request for more information about the Kensington Place and St Saviour's Health Village sites, due to be completed after the acute hospital at Overdale.
He said he would be completely transparent about the cost and timing of those projects in future but he did not have the information yet.
""What we need is an acute hospital. The other two areas, we're just starting work on the planning of those,"" he said.
He said, given the current global economic climate, it was ""common sense"" to break the project down into different parts so the government could be in the position to stop work if money ran out.
Chair of the Hospital Review Panel Deputy Jonathan Renouf said he ""totally rejects"" the idea that the review was not appropriate or objective scrutiny.
He said it simply pointed out where the minister's own commitment to following UK guidelines was deficient.
He said the review commissioned experts to look at the business case for the hospital and they pointed out that it ""didn't do a very good job"" at following the guidance for major business projects, guidance the minister had said he was using.
Renouf said: ""To me it feels a bit like the kid who says he's done his homework and then, when you point out he hasn't done his homework, says it was rubbish homework.""
He acknowledged that people wanted to see the acute hospital at Overdale built but there was still a ""desperate need"" for an overarching health strategy to determine where it fitted in to a bigger picture.

How family's garden centre blossomed over 70 years,"The family business is celebrating seven decades, but it has not always been rosy.",27 Apr 2025,"Beds, Herts & Bucks",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2wrerzlrgo,"One of the UK's early garden centres is celebrating 70 years as a family business, which saw the owner fall in love with and marry his first employee.
""Roger used to pick me up and take me to market every day; we gradually got fond of each other,"" recalled Hazel Aylett, now 84.
Horticulture student Roger Aylett founded Aylett Nurseries in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in April 1955, when ""there was nothing here except a green field"".
""There wasn't a garden centre, they weren't invented then. We used to sell our bunches of dahlias and people said 'why can't you sell us anything else?' And that's how it all started,"" said Ms Aylett.
Mr Aylett died in 2010 but his daughter and son-in-law Julie and Adam Wigglesworth continue to manage the business.
They now employ 150 staff, but Ms Aylett said the early days were very different.
""I was Roger's first student when I was 18 years old, and he paid me £1 a week,"" she said.
""Roger couldn't afford any staff – why was I sent here (from college) if it wasn't in the stars that I was going to fall in love with this man?
""We used to grow sweet peas and delphiniums for the cut flower trade, but we spent the first 15 years losing money. The bank manager begged my mother in law to get rid of the nursery as it was such a drain.""
Ms Wigglesworth said a turning point came in the late 1960s when another horticulturalist ""came up with the idea of putting plants into pots"".
""Before, you could only do it as bare root stock - it was very seasonal.
""Once this idea of containerisation took off, plants could be purchased and it really took off,"" she explained.
Mr Aylett, who Mr Wigglesworth described as ""an absolute character"", also drove the company forward with his passion and personality.
""He loved growing a good plant, and a good crop. He built the business on customer service, Roger was always on the shop floor,"" he said.
Mr Wigglesworth said the centre, which has recently added hundreds of solar panels to power 30% of its operations, had often forged ahead with new technologies.
""We were the first garden centre in the country to have bar codes,"" he said.
""In the 70s we had an environmental system to manage the greenhouse - now you get that on your phone, but Roger did it decades ago.""
Nursery manager Tony Day recently celebrated 50 years at Aylett, after starting his first job there aged 16.
""I came here as a nursery worker on a team of about 15 people, learning anything and everything,"" he said.
""My philosophy is to make sure I grow something well and make sure it's better next season.
""I don't think I would have been here if I didn't appreciate the Ayletts as a family as well. It helps to be appreciated in your job.""
Mr Day has seen gardening trends come and go.
""When I first started, there were a lot of the 'old boy gardeners', who loved dahlias, chrysanthemums, the old fashioned plants,"" he said.
""The gardens were bigger then. Now you get more patios and small gardens.
""The trends have changed from large lawns with decorative borders to smaller patio gardens. People love containers, smaller flowering plants round by their barbeques.""
Ms Wigglesworth admitted that garden centres today faced ""enormous challenges"".
""We've got climate change, plant health, issues of peat and as the world gets smaller - who know what diseases,"" she said.
Mr Wigglesworth said on the positive side, ""people are as interested in nature as they've ever been"".
""Garden centres have a rosy future. We've got an absolute wealth of experience,"" he added.
Ms Aylett, who lives on the site, said the memory of her husband still continued.
""We miss Roger every single day, he was the guiding light behind it all,"" she said.
""As a family business it's important to carry on, but what the future holds I don't know.""

"If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?","The government has pledged to reduce energy bills by using more renewables, but bills are currently rising.",24 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkep1vx3mro,"Energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family in April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.
But Labour pledged in its manifesto: ""We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good."" It also promised bills would come down by ""up to £300 by 2030"".
Responding to the 6% price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to ""our reliance on the fossil fuel markets"" and added: ""We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.""
The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.
More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?
There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.
The UK's electricity is expensive.
Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.
This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.
For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.
The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.
The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the ""wholesale"" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.
Other parts of the bill include ""network"" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and ""policy"" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.
The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.
The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.
Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.
Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a ""carbon price"" - a charge for emissions.
The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.
In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.
""The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,"" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.
Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.
But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.
The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity. To get developers to deliver this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.
It does that by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity generated for 15 years into the future.
If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company. If the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.
Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.
Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.
As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.
""There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,"" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.
""The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.""
The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.
This adds to the network costs in a bill.
Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.
Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.
Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.
The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear.
In the long term, renewables ""will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,"" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.
But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly.
Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive ""strike prices"", locking in higher costs.
""If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further… but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],"" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.
""That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.""
But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.
The government said earlier in February that its plans would ""bring down bills for households and businesses for good"" and lowering them by ""up to £300 by 2030"" remains an objective.

Guernsey civil servants agree deal for 5% pay rise,"Prospect, representing civil service staff, says the pay rise will be backdated to 1 January 2025.",15 Apr 2025,Guernsey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj45wpx5lzro,"Guernsey's police and civil servants have agreed a 5% pay increase which will be backdated to 1 January, and the government is hopeful pay deals with other groups will be signed off by the general election, the States says.
Members of Prospect, representing the civil service staff, said it balloted on a two-year offer (2025 and 2026) and it was accepted by 80% of those who voted following an initial rejection in January.
Prospect, which does not represent police officers, said the 2026 award was linked to RPIX as of June 2025.
Deputy John Gollop, pay negotiations lead for the Policy and Resources Committee, said the increase was a ""fair reward"" for its valued staff.
He also said the pay rise recognised the challenges with its public finances.
Gollop said: ""Staff will receive an inflation increase in 2026 as the second year of the deal.
""We have been having constructive negotiations with the remaining pay groups – police officers also recently accepted our offer – and we hope to conclude the remaining groups before the end of this political term.""
The States said it was still negotiating with the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT).
NASUWT general secretary Dr Patrick Roach said talks were ""progressing constructively"".
Dr Roach said: ""We remain focused on securing a pay award that fairly reflects the current financial climate facing workers and the essential and highly-skilled work our members do.
""We hope to be in a position to share proposals with members shortly.""
In January, Health and Social Care accepted a 5% increase.

Why is an at-risk bird colony thriving in Suffolk?,"Residents say they are ""fed up"" with the mess the birds leave - but why is this colony thriving?",24 Apr 2025,Suffolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x383gpk9o,"Residents in the Suffolk seaside town of Lowestoft have said they are ""fed up"" with endangered kittiwakes defecating on their streets and buildings. It turns out the town is home to one of the country's largest urban populations of the species, with a partnership between different agencies having been set up to safeguard them. But why are these birds thriving here, and what is so attractive about Lowestoft?
Since the 1970s, it is believed that the global kittiwake population has dropped by about 40%.
Despite the dwindling numbers, bosses at East Suffolk Council believe Lowestoft is home to about 1,000 nesting pairs.
Jon Carter, from the British Trust for Ornithology, based in Thetford, was not confident the number was this high, but was able to give some ideas about why they may have chosen Lowestoft.
He explained the first nesting pair in the town arrived in the 1950s and made the former South Pier Pavilion their home.
""They normally nest on sea cliffs and the next nearest natural colony really is in Yorkshire and the next one is further south down in Kent,"" Mr Carter said.
""It's a really odd place that they chose to start nesting in Lowestoft because there were no previous colonies there.
""So when they started nesting there in the 50s, it was pretty random. I think they just liked the pier and started nesting on it.
""Obviously, they did well there and they survived, and the numbers built up.""
Mr Carter added that at the time, there was a lot of fishing activity in the area that may have provided an easily accessible food source, but it was not entirely clear why they had chosen the town.
The birds typically arrive every February and March before leaving at the end of the summer.
In 2023, 'kittiwake hotels' were built in the area to give juvenile birds more choice of nests.
Pairs will return to the same nesting spot every year, but juveniles have to find new nests for themselves.
The hotels can offer homes for up to 430 pairs and it was hoped they would protect them from predators while keeping them away from the town.
However, just a few birds have taken up residency and Mr Carter said there could be several reasons why they were not using them.
""It takes them quite a long time to build a colony because they're quite long-lived, they're usually about 12 years old or so, but they can live up to 25, 28 years old, and they go back to the same place where they nested and where they were hatched,"" he said.
""So it'll take a while for anything new to build up.""
Kerry Blair, strategic director at East Suffolk Council, similarly stressed to BBC Look East the importance of recognising it was a ""long term process"" with the hotels.
""Just because you build a kittiwake hotel, doesn't mean that they all move in overnight,"" he explained.
""But providing alternative sites for the juveniles - so that'll be the juveniles that come from the nests - there is every chance that they will find a home in those alternative nesting sites.
""It's not a quick process, we're talking years to move populations.""
The British Trust for Ornithology believes there is ""good evidence"" that the decline in the kittiwake population has been driven by low breeding productivity, which itself could be related to changes in the population of their food source, sandeel.
Mr Carter also added that climate change had affected where the birds can find sandeel, and they were often travelling further to find them.
Mr Carter believed if the birds made use of the hotels provided, it could potentially lead to the numbers increasing.
However, he said it was hard to know with ""many factors affecting their decline"".

Blue-green algae blooms in Martray Lough,"The presence of blue-green algae in Martray Lough near Ballygawley is ""disheartening"", Daera has said.",10 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zzewlrpeo,"The presence of blue-green algae in Martray Lough near Ballygawley is ""disheartening"", the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) has said.
With the recent good weather, Daera said it was ""no surprise that we are beginning to see algae-blooms re-appear again this year"".
However, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency has not received any reports of blue-green algae in Lough Neagh.
The scale and severity of algae blooms this summer will ""be dependent on a number of factors,"" a Daera spokesperson said.
In the past two years Lough Neagh - the largest freshwater lake in the UK - has been badly affected by algae.
The algae are bacteria, which can cause skin irritation and sickness in people who come into contact with it, but the biggest risk is to pets, livestock and wildlife.
Along with invasive species in the form of water-clearing zebra mussels, and the weather effects of climate change, the perfect conditions were created for the potentially toxic algae to bloom from the depths where it has always been present.
A Daera spokesperson said its minister, Andrew Muir, had repeatedly said there were ""no quick fixes to the issues in Lough Neagh, with problems decades in the making and decades in the fixing"".
Speaking at an Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs committee meeting on Thursday,  Muir said: ""Spring should be about renewal not news reports of blue-green algae.
""Significant work is already under way to tackle the nutrient overload in our rivers, lakes and loughs.
""I will continue to lead and seek support for the tough decisions needed over the time ahead to improve our waterways and tackle climate change.""
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillor Mark Robinson believes the recent warm weather has ""played a big factor"" in the presence of the blue-green algae at the County Tyrone lough.
""There are a number of factors that play into it and maybe it is just a perfect storm at the minute,"" he said.
""I don't think it is a case of wanting to blame anybody here, I think it is a case of highlighting the fact it's an issue. It needs to be addressed, Stormont do need to investigate.""
Robinson said he has driven along the road past the lough for many years and it has had blue-green algae on it for as long as he can remember.
""I know people automatically jump in to blame the farmer for it but I don't think that is the case, there's a lot of issues that cause it,"" he added.
Sinn Féin councillor Gael Gildernew said the ""potentially toxic algae"" in the water at Martray Lough is ""very concerning from an environmental perspective"".
""I would urge people to follow the guidance where advised, as signs have been erected warning people not to enter the water or allow their pets to do so,"" the Clogher Valley councillor said.
""In the meantime, I will remain in contact with the NIEA for regular updates on the conditions at Martray Lough and on what is being done to aid its recovery."""
Numbers of Welsh bus users lag behind rest of Britain,Wales has seen the slowest post-Covid recovery in numbers of passengers returning to the bus network.,9 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp91ypp11vmo,"Wales' bus network has recovered slower post-Covid than any other nation in Great Britain, a Senedd report has said.
Passenger numbers in Wales in the year to March 2024 were 78.3% of the levels before the pandemic - lagging behind both England and Scotland.
The figures have been blamed on fewer older people using concessionary fare passes.
Members of the Senedd's climate change committee urged Welsh government ministers to get to the bottom of the issue. The Welsh government said it would study the report.
Transport for Wales (TFW) said recently published plans to bring buses under public control would ""allow us to really focus on providing an integrated public transport network that works for the people of Wales"".
According to data from the UK government bus passenger numbers in the 12 months to March 2024 were at 78.3% of where they were in March 2020.
That compares with 92.5% in Scotland, 89.5% in England and 89.5% for Great Britain as a whole.
Cabinet secretary for transport, Ken Skates, had previously suggested that while fare-paying passenger numbers had recovered, concessionary travel had not.
The Senedd committee's report said TFW chief executive James Price had ""pointed to Wales' historically high proportion of older bus users and suggested that the pandemic had led many to use online services, which had reduced their need to travel"".
People aged 60 and over in Wales are entitled to a concessionary bus pass, while in England bus passes are provided at state pension age.
Bus fares in England have also been capped, at £3 since December 2024, while there is free bus travel for under-22s in Scotland.
The bus industry in Wales is due for a major shake-up under plans to bring it back under public control, allowing to officials to have more in the say in the shape of the network.
Mr Price told the committee the new model could lead to a ""period of sustained passenger growth"" if it led to services being more reliable and easier to use.
The report from the climate change committee follows the cross-party group's annual scrutiny work of the TFW transport body, which runs most of Wales' trains.
Delays to new trains were also blamed for problems in performance at the rail operator.
The report said while Skates had said there had been ""significant improvements"" in punctuality and reliability between April and June 2024, this was followed by a decline.
Mr Price said the performance was plateauing rather than declining, and said services outside of the core Valley line network had faced disruption from extreme weather.
But at an evidence session he also blamed the speed that train builder CAF was producing some of the new trains promised by TFW.
Speaking in January, Mr Price said the service was dealing with ""a slightly lower number of CAF units, new train units, coming out of the maintenance facility per day than we would like to see.
""We are roughly four units short a day,"" he said.
""What it does mean is that, occasionally, we are short-forming a service with fewer carriages than we would want to have on there, which I think has led to a plateauing, as I said, rather than going backwards.""
The committee said TFW should use ""all options available to them"" to ensure contracts for new trains were met.
""Given the impact on the public purse, this should include, if necessary, asking the Cabinet Secretary for Transport to intervene,"" it said.
TFW said: ""We now have over 50% of our brand new trains running across Wales and we're within the final phases of delivering the South Wales Metro.
""The recent Bus Bill announcement will allow us to really focus on providing an integrated public transport network that works for the people of Wales.""
Transport Secretary Ken Skates said: ""We will study the report carefully and provide a full response.
""We already have bus services such as Traws Cymru were passenger numbers are increasing, and this is an indication of what we can achieve across Wales. New trains are being delivered.
""We are seeing real change on our railways, with, for example, over 80% of journeys on the North Wales Main Line on new trains. TFW are also continuing to build on performance improvements made over the past year."""
Tone deaf choir bringing joy to amateur singers,A choir for tone deaf people has added evening classes to meet the high demand.,14 Apr 2025,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crld3j90yd6o,"A choir that ""brings joy"" to tone deaf people has added evening classes to meet the high demand.
Zest Choir in South Gloucestershire welcomes people who ""think they can't sing"" and has proven to be very popular.
The group meets regularly at Longwell Green Community Centre and people say it ""brings joy"" to them.
Mary Williams, founder of Zest Choir, said: ""This is a safe space for people who think they aren't good enough just to let it rip, really, and have a really good time. It's really good for well-being as well.""
Hilary Thomas, 65, a member of the choir, said she ""absolutely loves"" it.
""I don't really care, I can hear my own voice but I don't care,"" Ms Thomas added.
""It's the fact that it's a tuneless choir and I thought, well, I'm tuneless, so I can come to this choir.""
""We've got people here who maybe be struggling with mental health issues. Some people come because they want to get better,"" explained founder Ms Williams.
Andrew joined the choir after he retired.
He said: ""Whilst I'm not tone deaf, I find it quite difficult to keep the pitch of a note and my sense of rhythm is not great either. But that's fine here.""
There are still spaces left for people to join the new Wednesday evening class.

"Wildlife hopes for new 600,000-tree forest",Greencroft Forest Park is being created on farmland at a former country estate in County Durham.,16 Apr 2025,Wear,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yggq77j82o,"The company planting a new, 600,000-tree commercial forest says it wants to improve wildlife habitats, open land up to the public and capture carbon.
Part of the former Greencroft Estate in Lanchester, County Durham, is to be turned into a 300-hectare (741-acre) woodland producing timber for the construction industry.
True North, the investment firm behind the plans, claimed the project will also give locals access to five miles of walking and cycle paths.
Greencroft Forest Park designer Sam Roberts, from Euroforest Silviculture, said the scheme will allow a number of habitats to be developed to attract amphibians, birds and potentially red squirrels.
The land was previously a private estate which had been abandoned and fallen into ruin.
Greencroft Hall was demolished but sections of its remains have been granted listed status and will be preserved, the owners said.
True North's chief executive Harry Humble said the afforestation scheme ""will be mixed forest of both commercial timber and native broadleaf planting, with a big element of public access and new public access routes through it"".
""The overall estate is some 1,400 acres and there are parts of the former Greencroft Hall, landscape gardens and parkland which we are not going to be planting for commercial forestry.
""There is really quite a strong heritage element within that, so we are hoping to bring all of those elements of the wider forest scheme into a leisure development as well.""
True North's wider plans for the land include building 140 holiday cabins in the middle of the forest, but this part of the development has yet to receive planning approval.
The forest, close to urban areas, such as Anfield Plain, Stanley and Lanchester, will consist of 31 different species including conifers and broadleaf trees.
The primary species will be sitka spruce which grows quickly.
""Around half the weight of a piece of wood is carbon,"" said Mr Humble.
""With all the afforestation that is going to happen here between now and 2050 there will be tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon locked up in the trees.""
Designer Mr Roberts said the scheme will allow the development of wet woodland, which he said is ""one of the fastest declining priority habitats in the UK"".
He plans to plant trees which enjoy saturated ground, such as willow.
""That will create nice ephemeral ponds for newts and other amphibians and fish species.""
He further hopes red squirrels will return to the area because their main rivals, grey squirrels, cannot live in sitka spruce trees.
""We can plant the trees here and hope that, should expansion efforts for the red  squirrel populations go well, there will be a forest ready for them to move into which will not be populated by grey squirrels,"" he said.
With Lanchester liable to flooding, it is also hoped that planting on previously unobstructed farmland will improve flood mitigation.
True North has been involved in a number of forest creation projects in the UK, including a controversial scheme in Stobo in Scotland.
Herbicides have been used on steep sections of the land but objectors argued this was not made known to the public before permission was granted.
Last year, Scottish Forestry ordered True North to cease planting trees in Stobo while it reviewed its original screening decision.
True North said some herbicide may be used as weed deterrent at Greencroft Forest Park but would not be used in the land preparation on site.
""All UK commercial forestry uses some herbicides, often to protect sapling trees in their infancy,"" the company said.

UK's rarest wildlife being 'pushed to extinction' by grass fires,Wildfires 'could spell the end' for rare species such as water voles and hen harriers.,16 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dej3x9432o,"Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being ""torched alive"" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned.
They include endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles, which are now the UK's fastest declining mammal.
The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed ""the last remaining"" local breeding habitat for golden plovers - considered one of the most beautiful birds of the British uplands.
So far this year 110 sq miles (284 sq km) of land has been burnt by wildfires around the UK - an area larger than Birmingham.
Figures obtained by the BBC show that in Wales, fire crews have battled almost 1,400 wildfires already this year, leading fire services to urge people to ""act responsibly"" and report any suspicious behaviour to the police.
The National Trust said 2025 was ""turning out to be the worst year ever for these human-caused fires across the country"".
""We're extremely worried, this is looking like it's going to be the worst year for seeing our wildlife going up in flames,"" said Ben McCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation.
A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.
Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an ""irreplaceable"" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.
Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.
In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.
While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were ""simply being torched alive"".
""That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,"" Mr McCarthy said.
He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.
Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.
Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.
Water voles are ""the fastest-declining mammal ever"" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.
""Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,"" he said.
The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.
""A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,"" said Mr Parry.
""I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.""
Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.
""We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,"" said Mr Parry.
""We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.""
The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a ""massive issue"", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.
Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: ""In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.
""We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.""
The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.
When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.
Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.
But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year.
From 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.
In north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.
Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.
Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.
In south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.
At Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.
Station manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand.
""We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,"" he said.
""We accept that some fires can be accidental, but deliberate fire setting is a crime and that's the message we'd like to get out.""

How Peter Dutton's heartland lost him Australia's election,"It was the opposition leader's home state that delivered Labor its win, with the red wave taking out his own seat.",7 days ago,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxg6x2vv4o,"For the past three years, when peers of Australia's former Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton were grilled over his divisive persona, they'd often profess his celebrity status in the north.
""Peter is one of us… He's very popular in Queensland,"" said the leader of the Nationals, the Liberal's coalition partner, earlier this year.
But on election night, it was Dutton's home state that delivered Labor its election win, with the red landslide ousting the veteran MP from his own seat of Dickson.
While votes are still being counted, Labor could pick up as many electorates in Queensland as it did across every other state and territory combined.
And that's thanks, in no small part, to a new bloc of young voters and women who are disillusioned with the Coalition, and attribute the party's emphatic loss to the ""Dutton effect"".
As 65-year-old coalition voter Sue, who didn't share her last name, bluntly puts it: ""This is where [Dutton's] from… People know him and they don't like him.""
The Moreton Bay region, about an hour north of Brisbane, is supposed to be Dutton heartland. Before Australia's federal election on 3 May, all three seats here were Liberal-held - though only by small leads, with Dutton's electorate of Dickson having the narrowest in the state.
Dutton's family have deep roots here, with his dairy farming great-grandparents having settled in the area in the 1860s.
When he first entered parliament 24 years ago, the region was made up of urban pockets and industrial estates surrounded by swathes of semi-rural land. Not quite metropolitan or rural, is how the former police officer described it in his maiden speech as MP.
Now Brisbane is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, and these outer northern suburbs are one of the main places it is squeezing people in. Residential development has exploded, and more  families, priced out of locations closer to the city, have moved in to Moreton Bay.
Full of the ""quiet Australians"" Dutton said would deliver him the election, outer-suburban neighbourhoods like these were at the heart of the Coalition's strategy.
The average household in Moreton Bay earns less than both the state and national average, with many of them relying on the health, trade and hospitality sectors for work. The Coalition hoped promises to cut fuel expenses, improve housing affordability and back small businesses would woo voters concerned about the cost of living.
Many Moreton Bay residents, like campaign volunteer Kenneth King, also felt Dutton's links to the area would give them a boost.
""I've known Peter Dutton for a lot of years,"" the Dickson local told the BBC on polling day. ""He's always been someone of high character, serious about effective policies and a lot of empathy for ordinary Australians.""
""He's very well respected in the community… People know him.""
But there's a difference between being well known and well liked, says Aleysha, a swing voter in the neighbouring electorate of Petrie, who declined to give her surname.
""I don't know whether he appeals to the everyday person,"" the 26-year-old nurse says. ""He doesn't put himself in the people's shoes.""
Her vote over the years has gone to a range of parties from right across the political spectrum – except the Greens, she adds with a quick laugh.
""I don't sit with any party. Being a Christian, it's whatever party aligns closest to my values,"" she says, adding that the future of her two young children is the other major consideration.
This election, that meant her vote went to Coalition incumbent Luke Howarth, who she knows personally from her church.
But while she's praying for a miracle, with the final votes still being counted, she's not surprised to find Howarth may be on his way out.
She says Labor ran very visible campaigns in the area, but tells the BBC that it was driving past the image of Howarth and his leader on billboards which stuck in her mind.
""Unfortunately I think that's what did it,"" she says.
""Peter Dutton's face behind him was a huge turnoff - for me personally too.""
Sue, who lives in the same electorate and is generally a conservative voter, says this election she was torn at the ballot box.
""I had a huge hesitation over it,"" she says. ""I don't like Albanese; I think he's like, weak.
""[But] Dutton's an unattractive personality... He thinks he's presenting himself as strong, but he presents himself as a bit of a bully.""
""Way back when, he seemed like a really good local member, but as he climbed the ladder, I don't know, something changed.""
Ultimately Sue also voted for Howarth - and she's similarly convinced Dutton lost him the seat.
""I spoke to a few friends… some did change their votes because of Peter Dutton,"" she says. ""People, rightly or wrongly, aligned Dutton with Trump. And that's very negative for just about any sane person.""
Many of the constituents the BBC spoke to stressed they did not want American style politics here.
Drew Cutler grew up in the seat of Longman, which shares borders with both Dickson and Petrie - and though he no longer lives in the area, the 28-year-old was so invested in the outcome he came back to campaign for Labor.
Won by Coalition MP Terry Young on a margin of 3% last election, it is now too close to call.
Mr Cutler, a former Labor party staffer, believes Labor ran very strong local campaigns. But he also thinks Dutton's policy flip-flopping and the aura of instability that projected was potent.
That included announcing, and then walking back, public service job cuts and plans to end work-from-home arrangements, as well as a fluctuating stance on electric vehicle taxes.
Such optics were especially damaging, Mr Cutler argues, when contrasted with the image of strong, decisive leadership Dutton tries to convey.
""I almost think the Australian people would have respected him more if he stuck to it… and said, 'This is what I'm putting forward - if you don't like it, don't vote for it',"" Mr Cutler tells the BBC.
Back in Dickson, Rick - a retiree and fresh Liberal Party member - said on election night that he also felt confusion played a role in the party's defeat, particularly among young people.
""I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,"" he said.
But 30-year-old April, who didn't provide her last name, says it is Dutton who didn't understand.
She can't remember a time when he wasn't in power in Dickson, and feels that over time he has lost touch with his own constituents and the country more broadly.
For her, the last straw was his instrumental role in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.
""I think he has caused a lot of harm to a lot of minority groups across the scale,"" she says.
For others in the electorate though, the last straw was watching Dutton fly to a fundraiser in Sydney as the area in and around Dickson was hit by Cyclone Alfred in February.
April didn't feel like Labor Party's offering was strong either, especially on climate action, so she decided to campaign for Ellie Smith, the so-called 'teal' independent running in the seat.
Disappointment - borderline embarrassment - that Dutton was from her local area had crystallised into determination: ""I felt like it was a duty in a way… our responsibility to get him out.""
Ultimately, the Coalition lost at least six seats to Labor in Queensland – all bar one in Brisbane. And while they are a few votes ahead in Longman as the count continues, they could still lose that too.
Queensland has long been a bit of a political wildcard, and often finds itself in the ""spotlight"" at federal elections, says Frank Mols.
The University of Queensland politics lecturer points out the state helped deliver Kevin Rudd's historic election win in 2007 and Scott Morrison's ""miracle"" victory in 2019. Last election, as a record number of people across the nation voted for candidates outside the two major parties, Queensland surprised the nation by giving the Greens three seats - up from none.
There are a couple of factors that make the state more ""volatile"" and likely to deliver upsets, Dr Mols says.
Firstly, it is the only state or territory, except for the island of Tasmania, where more than half of the population live outside the capital city of Brisbane.
""We talk about Queensland always being two elections, one in the south-east corner, and then the rest - and they often get very different patterns.""
There's also more political fragmentation in the state, Dr Mols says, which combined with Australia's preferential voting system can make political equations here tighter, and trends harder to predict.
But he – like many of the voters the BBC spoke to – largely puts last weekend's surprise for the Coalition down to Dutton and his broadly-criticised campaign performance.
While there's a tendency to attribute success or failure to policy issues, more often its really about voters' emotional response to candidates and leaders, Dr Mols says.
""If you do the barbecue test, is Dutton a person you would walk up to? Is he somebody you would warm to or gravitate towards?
""You can wonder: was Peter Dutton, in hindsight, the Labor Party's best asset?""
But Dutton may have had the opposite effect for the Greens Party, which has lost at least two of the three seats it gained in Brisbane in 2022. Their party leader, Adam Bandt, also appears to have been defeated in Melbourne, an electorate he'd held for 15 years.
""Perhaps in desperation, [Dutton] was gravitating towards culture war issues, sort of echoing Trumpian themes, if you like, and that has been punished,"" Dr Mols says. ""But also the Greens… who were perhaps seen as being at the other end of that shouting match, have not done well.""
Dr Mols also believes that desperation to keep Dutton out may have seen some former Greens voters prioritise Labor this time - though he points out more centrist Teal independents appear to have bucked that trend.
In any case, he doesn't see the result in Queensland as a groundswell of love for Labor. The state was still the only jurisdiction in Australia where there were more first preference votes for the Coalition than Labor.
""There has to be enough of a swing towards a party, but it's often that preferencing that actually tilts it over the line,"" he says.
""This is more of a Liberal loss.""
For many Coalition voters, that loss is deeply felt. Rick describes it as a ""real rout"".
But among others, like Aleysha, there is an inexplicable element of mirth.
""I think it's quite funny, that he slipped as much as he did,"" she says. ""And I can't tell you why.""

Brazil to host Prince William's Earthshot Prize,The climate prize ceremony will come just before Brazil hosts the COP30 climate summit in November.,4 Apr 2025,Latin America,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kv0kpyx1yo,"The Prince of Wales' Earthshot Prize will be held in Brazil later this year, Kensington Palace has announced, in the same month the country hosts the COP30 UN climate change conference.
The main awards ceremony, along with several days of events for nominees, investors and environmental leaders, will be held in Rio de Janeiro in November.
The global environmental award, founded by the prince, gives £1m to five winners judged to offer the best solution to some of the world's biggest climate challenges.
The Earthshot Prize is a 10-year project with past ceremonies held in London, Boston, Singapore and Cape Town.
Prince William said: ""2025 marks the midway point of the Earthshot decade and each year we've witnessed the remarkable power of human ingenuity in addressing our planet's most pressing challenges.""
""It is an honour to profile the people making our world a better place for us and for our children,"" he added.
A video announcing the plans featured the prince and several Earthshot supporters including David Beckham, Cate Blanchett, Hannah Waddingham and former Brazilian footballer, Cafu.
Fifteen projects will be shortlisted for a chance of winning the prizes.
The judging panel has received 232 nominations from projects based in South America – more than double the number received from the region last year.
Christiana Figueres, chair of the board of Earthshot trustees, has led a number of negotiations on international climate accords during a long career pushing for global climate solutions.
As a Costa Rican, Ms Figueres said it was a significant moment to see Brazil host the prize.
""It's very exciting, certainly for me as a Latin American….Brazil is at the heart of the challenge Earthshot faces,"" she told me.
""To have the prize come in just before COP brings attention to Earthshot. It is win-win for both COP and Earthshot.""
This year's Earthshot is being viewed as the curtain raiser to COP which is due to begin a few days later in Belém, the gateway to the Amazon.
It comes against the backdrop of Donald Trump's recent return to the White House in the US.
Trump is a known climate sceptic who has been vocal in his criticism of global climate action.
""That doesn't help but it doesn't stop the progress either,"" Ms Figueres said.
""He can't stop the advance of green technologies, he can't stop the public demand for cleaner air and a more sustainable world. None of that can stop because of political ignorance.""
Ahead of COP, there has been criticism of Brazil from conservationists for cutting down tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest to build a new four-lane highway in preparation for the climate summit."
Behind the scenes of the 'house of bears' photo,A photographer's iconic shots of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shine a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.,8 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250407-the-polar-bears-living-in-an-abandoned-arctic-weather-station,"A photographer's iconic shot of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shines a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.
In September 2021, Russian wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh and his team were sailing around the wild and remote Chukotka Peninsula in Russia's extreme northeast. They were hoping to visit Wrangel Island, a well-known gathering place for polar bears, when the weather turned.
""We faced a heavy storm, with super-strong wind and waves, and we tried to find a place to shelter from the storm because the boat was small,"" Kokh recalls. They sheltered near the rocky shore of a small, uninhabited island called Kolyuchin, home to an abandoned Soviet-era weather station – and made an unexpected discovery.
""We saw some movement on the island, took out our binoculars, and saw polar bears roaming around there, many of them, maybe 15 or 20,"" Kokh says. ""We were super surprised because we never expected to meet polar bears so far to the south. At this time of the year, they should be on the sea ice already, and on Wrangel Island, normally.""
The weather station on Kolyuchin had been abandoned in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stepping on the island to take pictures of the bears was too dangerous. Instead, Kokh used a drone, taking his time to get the bears used to it, then slowly flying it closer. As he was watching them, he noticed something else: there were bears inside some of the houses.
""I realised that it was a perfect setting for photography, because these houses are super photogenic, they are old and ruined, and animals looking out of these houses, is a perfect picture,"" he says. ""And the weather was terrible, [there was] wind and rain and fog, which is also very good for photography! So everything came together.""
One of the photos captures a bear in the entrance to the weather station, and another one looking out of the window. Titled ""House of Bears"", it won Kokh the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, given out annually by the Natural History Museum in London. ""It's the best picture I've ever taken, and I think I won't be able to repeat it, ever,"" he says.
Tom Smith, a professor of wildlife sciences at Brigham Young University in Utah, has spent decades conducting field work among bears, including polar bears, and says it's not unusual to see polar bears in abandoned buildings. ""They're curious animals so we see them in structures often, or they will be climbing on top of cars or pipelines,"" he explains. There has, however, been a more worrying trend across the Arctic, he says: as the sea ice melts, polar bears are increasingly approaching or wandering into inhabited towns or villages, to feed on open rubbish dumps. ""They are fatefully drawn towards human settlements,"" says Smith, and this can result in conflict with humans.
The problem is two-fold, according to Smith. One is that isolated, northern communities often use open rubbish pits near the village. Securing garbage so it can't be accessed, for example in bear-proof bins and enclosed landfills, is expensive, he points out – and in the past, was not necessary. ""The overwhelming Western influence in the north has resulted in [throwaway] economies that never existed there,"" he says. ""Those cultures never had a throwaway society, so the notion of having to secure garbage – that's a new thing.""
Secondly, Smith notes that polar bears are spending more time on land due to the climate-change-driven loss of sea ice. They are also shifting their dens from the ice onto the land, to avoid the risk of denning on the increasingly unstable sea ice, research in northern Alaska shows. Without the sea ice, the bears can't hunt for their preferred, ideal diet of blubber-rich seals, and may resort to land-based food, be it prey or rubbish.
""So we have a prediction that more and more bears are coming onto the land, they are increasingly hungry and drawn to these pits,"" Smith says. The rubbish pits tend to be close to the villages. ""Because of that, we can expect more and more conflict with bears,"" he warns.
He emphasises that polar bear attacks on humans are very rare. According to one study, across more than a century, from 1870 to 2014, there were only 73 attacks by wild polar bears on humans, distributed among the five countries with polar bears: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States. Twenty of the attacks were deadly, and 63 caused injuries. (Because the attacks often involved more than one person, the total number of deaths and injuries is higher than the number of attacks.) Smith says that humans are not part of bears' natural diet – in contrast to big cats such as tigers and lions, who do see humans as potential food. ""That is a global myth, that [polar bears] are the only bear that stalks and kills humans,"" he says.
Nevertheless, there have been cases where polar bears have attacked people, with malnourished male bears most likely to pose a threat to humans. In some cases, starving polar bears who have become used to human-provided food may then see humans as prey, research suggests. Smith says it's the increasing proximity to humans that's the problem, rather than the bears hunting humans as such: ""The [bears] are there for the garbage, and then they will spin off into the village and of course they're quite capable of ripping doors and windows off. So we've seen an uptick in these confrontations,"" he says.
A 2022 research paper warns that food from human sources – especially waste – is an emerging threat to polar bears. The supply of such human-provided food including from dumps is growing, according to the paper. As a consequence, some communities in the Arctic have seen startling incursions of dozens of polar bears. The study notes that when given the choice between sea ice, and rubbish dumps on land, polar bears still prefer the sea ice – suggesting that they are resorting to the dumps out of necessity.
For example, in 2019, 60 polar bears gathered at a dump near the village of Ryrkaypiy in the Chukotka region of Russia, a few 100 metres from the village, according to the study. The bears also entered the village, causing alarm, and forcing the villagers to cancel public events and keep their children at home. However, once the sea ice formed and thickened, the polar bears left the land and returned to the sea.
In Novaya Zemlya, a remote Russian archipelago, a similar invasion of 52 polar bears happened in 2019, according to the study. ""Although polar bears had visited the dump in previous years, this event was unprecedented,"" the researchers note, and was likely due to the loss of sea ice. In Arviat, an Inuit community in Nunavut, Canada, the number of polar bears using the local open dump has grown each year since record keeping began in the 1960s.
Spending more time on land could threaten the bears' long-term survival, Smith says, as the marine diet is more suited to them. In particular, the high fat content of their preferred prey, seals, is crucial for their health. Fat, in the form of seal blubber, makes up around 70% of polar bears' natural diet on the sea ice. It contains twice the energy per gramme as muscle. In fact, when catching a seal, the bears mostly eat the blubber and leave the meat behind. To capture seals, the bears need sea ice – they stalk the seals on the ice, or wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to appear. Over the past 50 years, as the sea ice has shrunk, the number of polar bears has fallen, studies show.
""They're using [the fat from the seal] for everything: growth, maintenance, reproduction, keeping their body warm,"" says Smith. ""They just need a seal and some water and they're fine. They're unusual animals,"" he adds. They can subsist on this high-fat, seal-based diet without suffering any nutritional deficits, he says: ""It's a metabolic marvel"".
When they can't access seals and instead resort to less fatty prey on land, such as Arctic birds, bird eggs, or food from dumps, the bears' health and reproduction rates decline, and they risk starvation, studies suggest. Polar bears on land lose around one kilogramme of body mass a day, research shows.
""Part of the problem we have with climate change is the scale of change is so rapid,"" says Smith. There's not enough time for the highly specialised polar bears, who evolved to thrive on a diet of marine mammals, to adapt to permanently being on land again, he warns: ""We're fearful this animal can't possibly adapt back to a land-based, herbivorous diet."" If they had to be on land constantly, ""as a species, they would die"", he says.
Smith and other researchers are appealing to governments to provide funding to help secure rubbish dumps near coastal villages from bears. ""It's extremely expensive. They need help. It wouldn't be asking too much to secure the garbage and make it safer for people, and for bears,"" he says. Otherwise, people confronted with growing numbers of bears in their villages may kill them to stay safe, he warns: ""It is extremely unfortunate to see bears die from such a preventable cause [as unsecured garbage].""
In the town of Churchill, Canada, closing an open dump, along with other measures, decreased damage and human injury. Smith and his colleagues are also studying a range of additional steps to help communities co-exist with polar bears, such as bear spray.
More like this:
• The huskies that revealed the rapid shrinking of Greenland's ice
• Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change
• The deep ocean photographer that captured a 'living fossil'
While the real-life human-bear conflict is playing out, humans around the world still love seeing polar bears in pictures, the reaction to Kokh's photos suggests. In a video call, he shows a wealth of artwork and even tattoos which people made as the photos went viral.
""This was an absolutely crazy time, because I got so many emails and interview requests, and many people were talking to me about these images. And they were saying something like: 'this is a post-apocalyptic picture, this is how our planet will look like if we continue to do the same things with the planet and won't change our ways',"" he says.
For Kokh, the award-winning photos of the polar bears opened many doors, and he has been on other expeditions to take photos of many kinds of marine wildlife. But as he reflects on that storm-swept journey to Chukotka, he comes back to the relationship between people and polar bears. For a start, even in that incredibly remote, wild region, you come across human rubbish, he says: ""What you see in this area of Russian Arctic, it's abandoned barrels, fuel barrels. It's a commonly known problem because in the Soviet Union they brought thousands of fuel barrels and abandoned them, because it was expensive to bring them back. And they still lie there, and polar bears are roaming around them."" In the photo series of the abandoned weather station, for example, there is a shot of the bears standing in a landscape of scattered barrels.
But Kokh also points out that the images can be interpreted in different ways – as a warning about our impact on the planet, but also, as testimony to the power and resilience of nature.
""When I was taking the picture, I was thinking about the striking contrast between the living animals, and these destroyed buildings,"" he says, and holds up a bottle, and a cup: ""You know, all the things we make – this bottle, this cup – all the things made by humans, will be destroyed one day and will cease to exist, if we don't continue to make them. If humanity will fail, nothing will remain of us. But life will still exist.""

Wild chimpanzees filmed using forest 'first aid',The research builds on the discovery that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate.,10 hrs ago,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj7ln85vxwo,"Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants - in multiple ways - to treat open wounds and other injuries.
University of Oxford scientists, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, filmed and recorded incidents of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other.
Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate.
The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use ""forest first aid"".
Researchers say the study, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, adds to a growing body of evidence that primates, including chimps, orangutans and gorillas, use natural medicines in a number of ways to stay healthy in the wild.
Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was ""a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene"".
""Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,"" she explained. ""The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.""
The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.
They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, ""because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy"".
Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala.
This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s – local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed.
There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs.
There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating.
This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.
Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound.
Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines.
""The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,"" Dr Freymann told BBC News.
""If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick.""
""But chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place, and how to find all they need to survive from their surroundings."""
Severe floods hit Lanzarote after torrential rain,A state of emergency was declared in the Spanish Canary Island after 6cm (2.4in) of water fell in two hours on Saturday.,13 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdz15q2931o,"Hundreds of homes and roads on Lanzarote have been flooded, after torrential rainfall swept across the Canary Island on Saturday.
Lanzarote's government declared a state of emergency overnight after 6cm (2.4 inches) of rain poured down on the popular holiday destination in just two hours.
No injuries have been reported by the Spanish authorities - and the state of emergency was lifted on Sunday morning.
The head of Lanzarote's emergency services told local media some homes had been submerged, with floodwaters leaving behind a ""great quantity of mud"".
""We have been working all night, attending 300 calls overnight, many of them in Arrecife and Teguise,"" Enrique Espinosa said on Sunday.
Emergency services attended more than 150 incidents in Costa Teguise and in excess of 70 in Arrecife, local media reports.
The area of San Bartolomé was badly hit, according to Lanzarote's government.
Dramatic footage circulating on social media shows a large surge of floodwater flowing rapidly under a bridge, leaving cars stranded on flooded roads.
The Canaries are particularly vulnerable to floods when hit with intense rain, as their dry climate and volcanic rock mean the ground does not absorb large volumes of water well.
The torrential rain came off the back of Storm Olivier, which swept over the Canaries, mainland Spain and Portugal in recent days - triggering several weather alerts.
Spain's meteorological service has issued weather warnings for many areas of the country from Sunday to Tuesday - including storms in the north east, rain in the Balearic islands and wind in parts of both the north and south coast."
'Warm' Pope's passion for football remembered,Father Marc Lyden-Smith says Francis brought Sunderland victory after holding the team jersey.,21 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdxj3nejpro,"A university professor and a priest have remembered ""warm"" and ""charismatic"" Pope Francis's passion for football.
The pontiff was pictured holding a Sunderland AFC jersey in 2013, with club chaplain Father Marc Lyden-Smith saying the team's subsequent victory over Newcastle was thanks to Francis.
And Prof Anna Rowlands, of Durham University, said he had roared with laughter when she told him she was a Manchester United fan the first time they spoke at length.
Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina, died at 07:35 local time (06:35 BST) on Easter Monday at the age of 88, the Vatican said.
His death comes after he appeared at St Peter's Square on Sunday to wish ""Happy Easter"" to thousands of worshippers.
Prof Rowlands said his death was a ""fragile"" moment.
The Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle Stephen Wright said the Pope had been ""a joy to meet in person and an inspiration to so many, Catholics and non-Catholics alike"".
The Church of England's Bishop of Jarrow, Rt Revd Sarah Clark, said the death of Pope Francis was ""deeply sad"" and she found him a ""great inspiration"".
Fr Lyden-Smith presented Francis with a Sunderland AFC shirt at a general audience in Rome in October 2013.
It was days before a derby game between the Black Cats and Newcastle.
""We can say that he was a committed Sunderland supporter and he held up the jersey and made a big thing of it,"" Fr Lyden-Smith told BBC Radio Newcastle.
""Then, of course, we beat Newcastle a few days later, so we have the Pope to thank for that victory, because he was a big, big football fan.""
He added Francis used to be a season ticket holder in Argentina and would also check on the Premier League in England.
Fr Lyden-Smith met Francis again during great mass and said the pontiff had told him he was keen to improve his English.
""Just a really, warm, welcoming, really lovely human being, just like a nice parish priest. Very down to earth, very natural. Just a very, very warm man,"" Fr Lyden-Smith said.
Prof Rowlands, from Manchester, spent two years seconded to the Vatican during Francis's papacy.
She said Francis wanted to know what football team she supported.
When she said she was a ""genuine, bona fide Mancunian, Manchester United fan by origin"", he had ""roared laughing"" and told his aide ""you see, she must have a sense of humour"".
""And that was the first extended conversation I'd ever had with him. So his nature was to tease you slightly and to be good humoured, and find a point of human connection with you,"" Prof Rowlands said.
""He was a totally normal, very at ease with people, kind of person.""
The Catholic social thought and practice professor said that despite his high office, he had a ""common touch"", and while quietly spoken, he was ""charismatic, warm, personable"".
Prof Rowlands was personally appointed by Francis as one of the few women to have governance roles in the Catholic Church, a job she said would previously have been held by a bishop.
She said his popularity within the Church extended beyond, because he was someone who showed ""moral leadership"" on issues ranging from the treatment of refugees to the climate.
Prof Rowlands said his death was ""a moment which feels very brittle and fragile on the global stage"".
""I think he'll be mourned as a figure who's got that kind of moral leadership, who had real character, and who was able to speak, without constant caveat, about basic human moral obligations,"" she added.

Wind farm fund supports rural community projects,"Local groups benefit from a share of £250,000 in community grants, a foundation says.",10 Apr 2025,Northamptonshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62gg882q0mo,"A wind farm fund has seen more than £250,000 awarded to local community groups, charities and volunteer-led organisations, a foundation said.
Northamptonshire Community Foundation (NCF), which manages the funds, said that since 1 April last year, the scheme had supported a grant for a defibrillator in the village of Winwick.
The library in Burton Latimer and 12 free-of-charge self defence and fitness workshops for women have also been supported.
Chief executive Rachel McGrath said rural areas were ""often overlooked when it comes to funding"", adding that NCF was ""committed to changing that"".
A wind farm fund is a dedicated pot of money - often established by wind farm developers - that provides financial support to local communities impacted by its development and operation.
The foundation, which has managed wind farm funds for 12 years, said money had also been used to support the replacement of floodlights at West Haddon Junior Football Club.
In Northamptonshire, the fund supports communities based in close proximity to wind farms, including Clay Coton, Crick, Lilbourne, Yelvertoft, Winwick, Cold Ashby, West Haddon, Guilsborough, Burton Latimer, Cranford, Rushton and Pipewell.
NCF added that it had reopened its creative climate action fund and small green arts fund.
The money will support up to three local groups with grant awards of up to £50,000 for creative projects that encourage people to make behavioural changes to protect the environment.

"Don't use barbecues on moorland, warns firefighter",Steven Fisher spoke out amid an amber alert for wildfires across most of the UK.,7 Apr 2025,Somerset,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25e9dnw2qo,"A firefighter has urged the public not to use barbecues on moorland following a serious blaze.
Steven Fisher, from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said it can take 200 firefighters around three days to put out wildfires.
Last week, a section of heathland on the Quantock Hills in Somerset set alight, with fire crews working through the night.
A rare Met Office amber alert for wildfires is in place across most of the UK, including the South West, following a dry spell that is expected to continue into the Easter holidays.
The wildfire alert follows the sunniest March on record.
The Devon and Somerset fire service has asked that the public remain ""extremely vigilant"" to reduce the risk of uncontrolled moorland blazes.
Mr Fisher said: ""We can have extremely large areas alight and, for us as fire crews, keeping up with that is a real challenge.
""We want to reduce them happening in the first place.
""One thing is the use of barbecues, particularly the disposable barbecues which aren't well insulated.
""We like to say sandwiches are safer, they're unlikely to start a fire. But make sure you pack everything up and take it with you.
""Things like glasses and jars can magnify the sun in the grass and start a fire. And things like cigarettes can start a fire very quickly.""
Philip Evans, Greenpeace UK senior climate campaigner, said experts have warned that wildfires are going to become ""more frequent and severe"" because of the climate crisis.
""The growing costs of extreme weather will only exacerbate the demands on our emergency services and over-stretched councils,"" Mr Evans said.
Some 286 wildfires were recorded between 1 January and 4 April 2025 – more than 100 above the number in the same period in 2022, according to the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC).
Record-breaking temperatures and unprecedented wildfire activity were seen in 2022.
Phil Garrigan from the NFCC said: ""There is no getting away from the fact that climate change is driving increases in extreme weather events, such as wildfires.
""We are seeing more wildfires for this time of year than we were in 2022, which was a record year for wildfires and that is deeply concerning.
""Wildfires are not a seasonal threat – they are becoming a persistent and growing risk to life, property, and the environment.
""We must adapt and invest now to ensure our services are equipped to meet this challenge.""

Could AI text alerts help save snow leopards from extinction?,"In Pakistan, it's hoped newly-developed AI cameras could warn villagers via text to move their livestock if snow leopards enter the area.",21 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn80v2ngp74o,"Snow leopards cannot growl. So when we step towards one of these fierce predators, she's purring.
""Lovely,"" as she's called, was orphaned and rescued 12 years ago in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan.
After years of relying on staff to feed her, she does not know how to hunt in the wild - and cannot be set free.
""If we release her, she would just go attack a farmer's sheep and get killed,"" Lovely's caretaker, Tehzeeb Hussain, tells us.
Despite laws protecting them, between 221 to 450 snow leopards are killed each year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says, which has contributed to a 20% decline in the global population over the past two decades.
More than half of these deaths were in retaliation for the loss of livestock.
Now, scientists estimate that just 4,000 to 6,000 snow leopards are left in the wild - with roughly 300 of these in Pakistan, the third-largest population in the world.
To try and reverse these worrying trends, the WWF - with the help of Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) - has developed cameras powered by artificial intelligence (AI).
Their aim is to detect a snow leopard's presence and warn villagers via text message to move their livestock to safety.
Tall, with a solar panel mounted on top, the cameras are positioned high among barren and rugged mountains at nearly 3,000m (9,843ft).
""Snow leopard territory,"" says Asif Iqbal, a conservationist from WWF Pakistan. He walks us a few more steps and points to tracks on the ground: ""These are pretty new.""
Asif hopes this means the camera has recorded more evidence that the AI software - which allows it to differentiate between humans, other animals and snow leopards - is working.
The WWF is currently testing 10 cameras, deployed across three villages in Gilgit-Baltistan. It has taken three years to train the AI model to detect these categories with impressive - if not perfect - accuracy.
Once we're back down the mountain, Asif pulls up his computer and shows me a dashboard. There I am, in a series of GIFs. It correctly detects I'm a human. But as we scroll down the list, I come up again, and this time I'm listed as both a human and an animal. I'm wearing a thick white fleece, so I forgive the programme.
Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. ""It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,"" Asif says.
Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by.
If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve.
While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides.
It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards.
""We noticed some of the wires had been cut,"" Asif says. ""People had thrown blankets over the cameras.""
The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often.
Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage.
Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them.
""It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,"" she says.
The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: ""My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?""
At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem.
According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock.
But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals.
""We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,"" he says.
Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target.
Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media.
While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution.
In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy.
Their work tracking these ""ghosts of the mountains"" is not over yet."
Swinney 'very moved' after Pope's funeral in Rome,First Minister John Swinney is among the Scots who have travelled to the Italian capital for the ceremony.,26 Apr 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r5xdpz2zvo,"Scotland's First Minister John Swinney has said the funeral of Pope Francis was ""very moving"" and ""uplifting"" after he attended the ceremony in Rome.
He travelled to the Italian capital for the Mass, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Prince William, US President Donald Trump and scores of other dignitaries.
Paisley Bishop John Keenan, clergy and parishioners from across the country were also in Italy for the service, which began at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). Many more followed the funeral at home.
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church died on Easter Monday aged 88, after suffering a stroke.
Pope Francis was laid to rest in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of Rome's four major basilicas.
In Scotland, a minute's silence was held in memory of the Pope ahead of Celtic's Scottish Premiership title decider match with Dundee United.
The first minister said the Pope showed the ""perfect example of leadership"" which combined ""spiritual leadership to the faithful and dignified leadership to the world.""
Speaking from St Peter's Square, he said: ""It's been a very moving ceremony, a very dignified ceremony, paying tribute to a life of service in arguing for the protection of the poor and to support those who seek justice.
""But also an uplifting service about the hope for the world that Pope Francis conveyed.""
He praised the Pope for ""acting purposefully to protect the planet through climate action"".
The first minister said the Pope set an example to the world of ""turning our backs on conflict and war"".
He said he felt ""deeply privileged"" to represent Scotland at the funeral and spoke about his own experience of Christianity.
Swinney said he had been baptised a Protestant but worshipped in the Catholic Church with his wife and son.
He added: ""My wife and son are Catholics, I am not a member of the Catholic Church. But what for me matters is the deep anchoring of faith in my life.
""It makes me who I am. It connects me with the love of God and it also connects me with the important teachings of doing unto others as I would have done unto me.
""That drives my whole approach to life and it drives the political leadership and the national leadership I exercise as first minister of Scotland.""
The service saw a funeral procession accompanying the Pope's coffin to the square in front of St Peter's Basilica.
It was led by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.
The Vatican said about 250,000 people gathered in St Peter's Square and the nearby streets for the funeral.
The service ended with a final commendation - a concluding prayer where the pontiff was formally entrusted to God.
Silence fell across the square as the Pope's coffin was blessed with holy water and incense was burned to symbolise cleansing.
Bishop John Keenan, of the Paisley Diocese, represented the Bishops' Conference of Scotland (BCOS) at the funeral, having met Pope Francis on several occasions.
He was among hundreds of senior clergy in the vast crowd at St Peter's Square.
Bishop Keenan described Pope Francis, who was the first South American pontiff, as a ""breath of fresh air.""
He told BBC Scotland News: ""I'm used to Rome but I've never seen crowds like this.
""The atmosphere is sombre, there's a sense we've lost a father of the universal family, and there's a sense across the world that we've lost a fairly unique leader.
""But's it's positive as well - there's a gratefulness there too.""
An array of world leaders and dignitaries attended the service.
But thousands of ordinary Catholics also arrived to pay their respects to a pontiff known for shunning many of the extravagant trappings associated with the position.
And many queued for hours earlier in the week to see Pope Francis lying in state in St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican.
Among them was a group of young women from Scotland who travelled to Rome for Pope Francis's funeral to ""celebrate a great leader"".
Claire, from Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, said it was a ""sad day for the Catholic Church"".
Her friend Erin added: ""Although it's sad, it's great to be able to celebrate how great a pope he was.
""As a young person, I think he really spoke to the youth.""
Tom Clarke, secretary of the Catholic Association at Glasgow University, had only just returned from an Easter trip to Rome with his family - where he saw Pope Francis in person - when he learned of the death.
He then flew back out to Italy on Friday to be there for the funeral.
Mr Clarke told BBC Scotland News: ""Pope Francis is all I've known from a Catholic perspective.
""I think the testimony of lots of young people, including myself, at the funeral, is important to show to the world it's something that really means a lot to us.
""He needs our prayers as he's passed on from this life.
""It's a hard job and he will have struggled with that, so it's nice to go over and pay our dues to him.""
Other Scots were already intending to be in Rome for the canonization of teenage saint Carlo Acutis.
It was scheduled for Sunday but has been postponed due to the death of Pope Francis.
John Patrick Mallon, of Catholic video production company Sancta Familia Media, said the city was already packed full of people, with ""extraordinary security measures"" put in place by the Italian government.
He said: ""It's incredibly moving.
""Here we see thousands of people from all walks of life, and that's very uplifting to me.
""The atmosphere is more gratitude than sadness.""
In Scotland many other Catholics followed the funeral on TV, while a Requiem Mass for Pope Francis will be held at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh on Monday.
Flags on Scottish government buildings also flew at half-mast during the funeral in honour of Pope Francis."
Grant will allow more tree-planting for town,"Trowbridge, Wiltshire, can start phase two of a tree planting project after a grant from a national fund.",6 Apr 2025,Wiltshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gl17jpv2o,"A town will be able to enact the next phase of a project after it was awarded a grant for planting more trees.
The grant from the Trees for Climate programme will go towards the Trowbridge Green Thread project, named to the reflect Trowbridge's weaving history.
Since spring 2024, about 400 trees have been planted in the town as well as thousands of whips, which are smaller tree seedlings.
The town council said this time it will invest in some bigger tree guards after some trees were damaged during the first phase.
Part of the national Government-led Nature for Climate fund, Trees for Climate is a woodland creation programme which is taking place across England's Community Forests.
Planting has happened in parks, allotments and green spaces like Biss Meadows, Paxcroft Brook Open Space and the Sensory Garden as well as fruit trees for The Mead School and Castle Mead School.
The council added it had wanted to plant more trees in urban areas, but could not get permission from landowners for all the places suggested by residents.

Resurrecting Italy's 'dead' sea - with plants,Decades of industrialisation have polluted the waters of Italy's Mar Piccolo and brought mussel farming to its knees. Can plants bring back a traditional way of life?,14 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250411-saving-italys-polluted-mar-piccolo-using-plants,"Decades of industrialisation have polluted the waters of Italy's Mar Piccolo and brought mussel farming to its knees. Can harnessing the power of plants bring back a traditional way of life?
Adriano Lippo grips the tiller of his small boat, staring out over the dark blue waters of the Mar Piccolo. ""I don't think it will happen this year,"" he says, shaking his head. ""Everything is dead."" The air carries a scent of salt, heat, and the bittersweet nostalgia of summer's end.
For the past decade, Lippo has made the same journey at the end of every summer, steering his boat between the port and the looming smokestacks of Taranto, southern Italy. His task: to transfer mussels from one inlet to the other across the Mar Piccolo, a semi-enclosed bay located between the city and the open sea. The narrow strait connecting the Mar Piccolo's two inlets has always been a lifeline for mussel farmers – a vital passage to shield their harvests from the contamination that has plagued the first inlet after years of relentless industrial growth.
The first inlet has historically been the best site for collecting larvae, and mussel farmers have passed down this knowledge over the generations, explains Giovanni Fanelli, a researcher working with mussel farmers at the National Research Council in the Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque (CNR-IRSA). ""The first inlet is closer to the open sea, allowing cooler water to stream in. But for years, it has not been possible to complete mussel growth in that area,"" says Fanelli, as he bends from his boat to collect a submarine data logger, a device used to record and store environmental data underwater.
When mussels reach a certain size, farmers must transfer them to the second inlet, which lies further from the sources of pollution, to complete their growth. This allows the mussels to purge any toxins they may have absorbed during their early growth phase in the first inlet. But last year, rising temperatures killed the mussels before they could even make the trip. Ninety per cent of mussels were lost in the final weeks of September, devastating current yields and jeopardising future harvests.
Once the lifeblood of a centuries-old tradition, the Mar Piccolo supported generations of mussel farmers, producing an impressive 60,000 tonnes of mussels annually at the sector's peak in the early 2000s. Since then, mussel farming has been in decline, with pollution and heatwaves exerting ever greater pressure on an already precarious sector.
Now, researchers and mussel farmers are pinning their hopes on a plan to restore the contaminated Mar Piccolo through phytoremediation, a process where plants are used to absorb harmful toxins. While the approach holds promise for both the environment and the livelihoods of mussel farmers, its implementation faces significant hurdles, including logistical challenges, funding constraints and the ongoing impact of heavy industry in the region.
Known as ""the city of the two seas"" because of its location between the Mar Grande – the open sea – and the Mar Piccolo, Taranto has long wrestled with the impacts of industrial development. Since 1889, it has hosted Italy's largest naval base and military shipyard, and a major oil refinery and cement plant have been operating since the second half of the 20th Century. More recently, the city has been home to one of the biggest steel factories in Europe, Acciaierie d'Italia – still referred to locally by the name of its former owners, the state-owned Ilva Group.
Operational since 1965, at its peak, the factory produced more than 11 million tonnes of steel every year. Over the years, various scientific studies have identified alarmingly high levels of heavy metals and organic pollutants in marine sediments, alongside elevated cancer rates in the areas closest to the factory.
A trial in 2021 convicted 37 people and three companies for allowing the steelworks plant to emit deadly pollution, which the trial found had caused a surge in cancer in Taranto. However the verdicts were overturned by an appeals court in 2024. New legal proceedings are now underway.
A vibrant ecosystem home to seahorses, rare seaweeds and endangered fan mussels, the Mar Piccolo's low salinity levels create an ideal environment for mussel cultivation. ""What should be, according to human logic, practically a putrid pond is instead a sea rich in biodiversity,"" says Giovanni De Vincentis, President of the Taranto branch of the World Wildlife Fund. The vitality of this ecosystem is largely attributed to the citri – submarine springs that help maintain relatively stable temperatures, ranging between 15C (59F) and 18C (64F) throughout the year. ""This unique feature acts as a natural temperature regulator for the Mar Piccolo, supporting its rich biodiversity and fostering the growth of the Taranto black mussel,"" explains De Vincentis.
As filter-feeding organisms, mussels can accumulate toxic contaminants in their tissues. In 2011, concentrations of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that exceeded European Union standards were found in mussels grown in Mar Piccolo's first inlet, leading to a temporary ban on mussel farming in the area. Since then, stringent pollution controls have been implemented. ""The local health authority takes samples to analyse. If the product is free of PCBs, dioxins, and other contaminants, they approve us to transfer the mussels from the first inlet to the second,"" explains Lippo.
For Lippo and other mussel farmers, the need to relocate their entire mussel crop to the second inlet is increasingly jeopardising their harvest. ""From the moment all this started, mussel farming has been brought to its knees, and the mussel farmers have paid the price. The climate crisis has further accentuated these problems,"" says Fanelli. This past July, the temperature in the second inlet climbed to 31.5C (89F), reports Fanelli – a level that scientific research indicates can be fatal to mussels. An estimated 9,000 tonnes of mussels, valued at €8m (£6.72m, $9.07m), perished last year.
Environmental remediation in Taranto has a long and complex history. ""An endless story,"" says Vera Corbelli, the former special commissioner for Taranto's remediation efforts. Corbelli was appointed in 2014 with a mandate to lead targeted interventions to deal with the contamination. During her six-year tenure, she oversaw remediation projects and carried out extensive research covering an area of 564 sq km (218 sq miles), which includes the Mar Piccolo. ""We realised that much of the Mar Piccolo had been used as a dumping ground,"" says Corbelli. ""We found everything – cars, hospital equipment, washing machines, refrigerators. Removing this debris was our first step."" Yet further progress on the ground remained frustratingly slow.
It wasn't until early 2024, when geologist Vito Felice Uricchio became the new special commissioner for Taranto's remediation efforts, that significant progress began to take shape. Although Uricchio had been working on environmental solutions for years, his efforts are only now translating into tangible policy actions.
""It started over 15 years ago,"" Uricchio recalls, of his environmental work in the area. ""There was not only an environmental need but also a social one."" At the time, Uricchio served as a researcher and coordinator. Alongside Reverend Nicola Preziuso, a priest in the Tamburi district which lies adjacent to the factory, Uricchio and his team of researchers launched a pilot project aimed at providing both ecological restoration and employment opportunities for workers who had lost their jobs. The initiative focused on decontaminating one hectare of polluted land using plants such as the Monviso clone, a species known for promoting PCB biodegradation through its root system.
""The first 600 [poplars] were planted, then another 600,"" Preziuso says. ""We kept planting and planting. At first, the plants ranged from 50cm (20in) to 60cm (24in) in height. Over time, they've grown to about 12 to 13m (40 to 43ft), with strong, consistent trunks – a beautiful sight on a terrain condemned to be contaminated.""
After a year of planting, chemical analyses revealed significant improvements, demonstrating the method's ability to address both organic and inorganic contamination. Inspired by this success, Uricchio now aims to deploy the technology on a larger scale, targeting the heavily polluted first inlet of the Mar Piccolo.
The process can treat soil up to 5m (16.5ft) deep – the reach of the plant roots – at a fraction of the cost of traditional remediation methods. ""Traditional soil removal, or 'scarification', involves excavating contaminated soil and sending it to landfills, which is both wasteful and harmful,"" Uricchio explains. ""It takes thousands of years to form just one centimetre of soil from bedrock. Discarding that is criminal.""
The idea of using living organisms to clean up toxic areas is not new. Early research primarily focused on the use of microbes to break down waste materials and pollutants. Over time, scientists expanded their studies to include plants capable of performing similar functions. In the 1990s, Rutgers University biologist Ilya Raskin, who first coined the term ""phytoremediation"", demonstrated the technique's potential by using mustard seeds to extract heavy metals from contaminated soil around Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
While many plants can absorb organic compounds such as dioxins and PCBs, only certain types, known as hyperaccumulators, are capable of effectively absorbing and tolerating high concentrations of heavy metals. This group includes poplar trees, used in Uricchio's research, as well as other species like sunflowers, some types of grass, and hemp.
Though current research so far shows promise, Werther Guidi Nissim, an assistant professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, says phytoremediation alone is unlikely to fully decontaminate an area as large as the Mar Piccolo. The long timeframes needed – from a few years for the easiest pollutants to centuries for some metal and organic compounds – are another bottleneck, according to Nissim.
Instead, the technique should be combined with other more traditional remediation methods like excavation and soil removal, he says. ""Since, in most cases, sites are polluted by different contaminants, an integration between conventional and green approaches such as phytoremediation could be an interesting idea to explore.""
Acknowledging these limitations, the remediation plan for Taranto encompasses both typical remediation approaches alongside more innovative approaches, says Uricchio. ""Phyto-assisted bioremediation will be used in cases where contamination affects the most superficial soil layers or depths compatible with the root systems of the species intended for use,"" he explains.
In addition, most phytoremediation projects have so far focused on the use of terrestrial plants on land, says Nissim. In saline environments, salt-tolerant species of plants, known as halophytes, must be used, and while research is still ongoing, they also form part of Uricchio's plan for the Mar Piccolo. Algae species, such as sea lettuce, can also play a role. According to Uricchio, these algae not only help restore ecosystems but also have valuable industrial applications, including in bioethanol production.
Taranto is one of 42 contaminated areas in Italy designated a ""site of national interest"" because of the urgent need for remediation. The sixth Sentieri Report – an epidemiological study of communities living in industrially contaminated areas in Italy – highlights the severe health risks associated with living in polluted environments. It also warns that even the most well-executed remediation efforts risk being compromised by ongoing or future recontamination.
""In places like Taranto, even if we managed to carry out the best possible remediation, the benefits would be completely nullified by the continuation of polluting activities,"" says Agostino di Ciaula, a doctor and researcher of the effects of pollution on human health.
Despite a ruling by the European Court of Justice last year stating that the heavily indebted steel plant should be shut down if it continues to pose environmental and health risks, it remains operational. Under state ownership since 2020, the plant plans to produce 3.5 million tonnes of steel in 2025, as the Italian government searches for new owners.

In a joint statement, Giovanni Fiori, Davide Tabarelli and Giancarlo Quaranta, the current commissioners of Acciaierie d'Italia, tell the BBC investments in maintenance have improved efficiency and sustainability, and emissions reductions have been achieved through upgrades to cooling and gas purification systems. ""These efforts are driven by the determination to lift Acciaierie d'Italia out of a period of decline, ensure production continuity, and create the conditions for a more sustainable future.""
Meanwhile, Uricchio's broader vision to restore Mar Piccolo faces significant hurdles. Securing full operational permission from the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security took nearly a year, and he is still waiting for the necessary funding. Of the estimated €500m (£423m, $566m) needed for Taranto's decontamination, only €52m (£44m, $58m) is currently available. The Ministry has acknowledged the uphill battle. ""The funds available in the Special Accounting [funds allocated for sites that have yet to be remediated] are partially being used to settle debts left by previous commissioners. Soon additional resources will be unlocked,"" a spokesperson tells the BBC.
More like this:
• Mar Menor: cleaning Europe's largest saltwater lagoon
• The rewilded golf courses teeming with life
• The giant battery that was once a UK coal plant
A significant portion of funding was expected from the Contratti Istituzionali di Sviluppo (CIS) – a government-led instrument aimed at accelerating strategic projects in regions facing economic or environmental challenges, using EU and national funding. In a move criticised by trade unions and environmental groups, a decision about CIS funding for the remediation of the Mar Piccolo was effectively halted in December 2020.
Substantial funding is expected this year from the Just Transition Fund, a European Union fund aimed at supporting economic diversification and the energy transition, and the EU Fund for Development and Cohesion. Uricchio has submitted seven funding proposals on green supply chains that the Just Transition Fund could potentially support. These initiatives focus on soil and surface water decontamination and reducing particulate matter.  However, Uricchio fears these funds might be insufficient, even if they are approved. ""For this reason, I am advocating for the exploration of additional funding channels,"" he says.
With promises of action and new funding on the horizon, the question remains: will it be enough to restore Taranto's future and protect the livelihoods of mussel farmers and citizens?
The embattled Uricchio remains full of fight. ""I want to act; I want to remediate as much as possible.""

Warning as dog freed from car in spring sunshine,Derbyshire Police had to smash the window to a car parked in Clay Cross.,11 Apr 2025,Derbyshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34qv502z2o,"Police have issued a warning after officers smashed a car door window to free a dog that had been left inside.
The incident in Clay Cross on Wednesday has led to a plea from Derbyshire Police for people not to leave dogs in cars during warm weather this Easter.
The force said an ""irresponsible dog owner"" had left a dog inside a ""very hot"" Citroen Picasso, which led beat officers and the force's dog unit to smash a side window to gain access.
A spokesperson for the beat team warned ""a car can become as hot as an oven"" - even in April when the weather does not feel that warm.
The advice comes as BBC forecasters predict sunshine and highs of 20C (68F) in parts of Derbyshire.
Police said the ""friendly fella"" was freed and taken away, with a message left for the owner.
A spokesperson said: ""Many people think it's OK to leave their dog in the car if they're parked in the shade or the windows are open.
""When it's 22 degrees outside, the car could reach an unbearable 47 degrees within an hour.
""It's very dangerous and will cause your dog suffering and harm.""
The RSPCA recommends anyone seeing a dog inside a vehicle showing signs of heat stroke to call 999.

First minister leads Wales' tributes after Pope dies,"Actor Jonathan Pryce, who played the late Pope Francis in a film, is among those paying tribute.",21 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz95ve3z9z1o,"First Minister Eluned Morgan has paid tribute to Pope Francis following his death at the age of 88.
He died on Monday, the Vatican announced, a day after he appeared in St Peter's Square to greet thousands of worshippers.
Morgan said it was with ""great sadness that I have learned of the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis"".
""As first minister of Wales, and as a Christian, I offer my deepest condolences to the Catholic community in Wales and around the world,"" she said.
""Pope Francis led with unwavering humility, courage and profound compassion.
""Throughout his papacy, he was a tireless advocate for the poor, the marginalised and the displaced.
""He reminded us all that the fight against poverty, climate change and injustice is not just a political or social task, but a moral calling.
""His message was clear: every person, regardless of background, race, or sexuality, deserves dignity, respect and love.
""His famous call to 'not judge, but walk with' exemplified a faith rooted in love, empathy and understanding for all people, focusing on compassion rather than condemnation.""
Cardinal Bergoglio of Argentina was in his 70s when he became Pope Francis in 2013.
Last month, he was discharged from hospital after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia.
Morgan added: ""In his final months, he spoke with moral clarity, condemning what he referred to as the 'genocide' in Gaza, urging the world to recognise the humanity of all people and to choose peace over destruction.
""In a world that often feels divided, Pope Francis built bridges of unity and his legacy will endure in the lives he touched and the values he championed - values that continue to inspire us here in Wales.
""On behalf of the Welsh government, I offer our deepest sympathies to all those mourning his loss. May he rest in peace, and may his example continue to guide and inspire us all.""
Mark O'Toole, who was named archbishop of Cardiff-Menevia by Pope Francis in 2022, described him an ""exceptional shepherd of the Church"".
""By the manner of his life, Pope Francis has always challenged me to be a better, more faithful disciple of Jesus Christ,"" he said.
""We now entrust him into the merciful hands of the Lord whom he has served so faithfully and generously.
""We accompany him with our prayers on this final journey.""
Anglican Archbishop of Wales Andy John said the ""world has lost a leader whose love, compassion and care for the poor and marginalised were worthy of the saint from whom he took his name"".
""In the Church in Wales, we join in prayer with our brothers and sisters in the Roman Catholic Church as they mourn the loss of the Holy Father, and we give thanks with them for a life of faith which has been an inspiration to countless millions,"" he said.
""In Wales, we shall have a lasting reminder of his generosity with the gift of a piece of the True Cross, which is incorporated in the ceremonial Cross of Wales which led the Coronation procession and which is now shared between the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches in Wales.""
Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce said: ""It was an absolute privilege to portray him in the film The Two Popes"", alongside another Welsh actor Sir Anthony Hopkins.
""He was a man of integrity who embraced diversity and equality, spoke for the poor, the disenfranchised, refugees and immigrants.
""And I would hope that world leaders will listen to his teachings because, well, sadly, they haven't shown any sign of doing so to date.""
40-year-old Bryn Jones, from Talwrn, Anglesey, was a postgraduate student studying in the Vatican when Pope Francis was elected in 2013.
He said: ""There was a lot of energy when he became Pope, you could feel it, feel his energy throughout the Vatican.
""He gave more emphasis on love and the love to fellow-man than in the past and you could tell that in his comments he made about lesbian and gay people.
""But what struck you about Francis' papacy was that he gave so much emphasis on serving the people""
Former BBC Rome correspondent Guto Harri said Pope Francis was a ""very different Pope"" who showed what it meant to be ""humble, caring and tolerant of others"".
""He was from a very different background than the majority, coming from South America, and he used that perspective to ground the church, if you will, in the third world, in Africa and Latin America.
""But he has shown more than anything that there was an alternative to theology and orthodox religion, if you will, because the language he spoke was to lead by example.""
Darren Millar, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, met Pope Francis last year.
""He was in good spirits and spoke passionately about peace, reconciliation and justice,"" Mr Millar said.
""He was a truly remarkable man who loved Jesus and devoted his life to service of the Church.
""I pray that God will give the College of Cardinals all the wisdom they need as they prepare to elect a successor.""
Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said the Pope's ""voice for the poor and the oppressed across the world will be greatly missed""."
Hundreds of flights cancelled in China as strong winds hit capital,"State media outlets earlier warned that people weighing less than 50kg may be ""easily blown away"".",12 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89gp9g5zyjo,"Hundreds of flights have been cancelled and trains suspended as gales hit Beijing and northern China on Saturday.
By 11:30 local time (03:30 GMT) on Saturday, 838 flights had been cancelled at the capital's two major airports, according to the news agency Reuters.
Wind gusts of up to 93mph (150kph) - the strongest in the Chinese capital for more than half a century - are set to continue through the weekend, forcing the closure of attractions and historic sites.
Millions were urged to stay indoors on Friday, with some state media outlets warning that people weighing less than 50kg may be ""easily blown away"".
Train services, including the airport's express subway line and some high-speed rail lines, have been suspended.
Parks were also shut, with some old trees reinforced or trimmed in preparation - but almost 300 trees have already fallen over in the capital.
A number of vehicles were damaged, but no injuries were reported. In Beijing, most residents followed authorities' advice to stay indoors after the city warned 22 million residents to avoid non-essential travel.
""Everyone in Beijing was really nervous about it. Today there are hardly any people out on the streets. However, it wasn't as severe as I had imagined,"" a local resident told Reuters.
Meanwhile, a businessman from the Zhejiang province, near Shanghai, had his flight home cancelled.
""Because of the severe winds, all flights scheduled for last night and today were cancelled. So I will probably rebook my flight in a couple of days. I'm now basically stranded in Beijing,"" he said.
The strong winds are from a cold vortex system over Mongolia and are expected to last through the weekend.
Winds bringing sand and dust from Mongolia are routine in spring, but climate change can make storms stronger and more severe.
Beijing issued its first orange alert for strong winds in a decade, with the strongest winds expected to arrive on Saturday.

Read Pope Francis's final address in full,A full transcript of the pontiff's final address on Easter Sunday 2025.,21 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9577g1k1o,"Pope Francis, who has died aged 88, made his final public appearance on Easter Sunday at the Vatican's St Peter's Square.
After wishing the gathered crowd of more than 20,000 a happy Easter, he indicated that Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, would read a message he had written.
Here is the full text of his final public address, as released by the Vatican.

""Christ is risen, alleluia!
Dear brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!
Today at last, the singing of the 'alleluia' is heard once more in the Church, passing from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, and this makes the people of God throughout the world shed tears of joy.
From the empty tomb in Jerusalem, we hear unexpected good news: Jesus, who was crucified, 'is not here, he has risen' (Lk 24:5). Jesus is not in the tomb, he is alive!
Love has triumphed over hatred, light over darkness and truth over falsehood. Forgiveness has triumphed over revenge. Evil has not disappeared from history; it will remain until the end, but it no longer has the upper hand; it no longer has power over those who accept the grace of this day.
Sisters and brothers, especially those of you experiencing pain and sorrow, your silent cry has been heard and your tears have been counted; not one of them has been lost!
In the passion and death of Jesus, God has taken upon himself all the evil in this world and in his infinite mercy has defeated it. He has uprooted the diabolical pride that poisons the human heart and wreaks violence and corruption on every side. The Lamb of God is victorious! That is why, today, we can joyfully cry out: 'Christ, my hope, has risen!' (Easter Sequence).
The resurrection of Jesus is indeed the basis of our hope. For in the light of this event, hope is no longer an illusion. Thanks to Christ — crucified and risen from the dead — hope does not disappoint! Spes non confundit! (cf. Rom 5:5). That hope is not an evasion, but a challenge; it does not delude, but empowers us.
All those who put their hope in God place their feeble hands in his strong and mighty hand; they let themselves be raised up and set out on a journey. Together with the risen Jesus, they become pilgrims of hope, witnesses of the victory of love and of the disarmed power of Life.
Christ is risen! These words capture the whole meaning of our existence, for we were not made for death but for life. Easter is the celebration of life! God created us for life and wants the human family to rise again! In his eyes, every life is precious! The life of a child in the mother's womb, as well as the lives of the elderly and the sick, who in more and more countries are looked upon as people to be discarded.
What a great thirst for death, for killing, we witness each day in the many conflicts raging in different parts of our world! How much violence we see, often even within families, directed at women and children! How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!
On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!
I would like us to renew our hope that peace is possible! From the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Resurrection, where this year Easter is being celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox on the same day, may the light of peace radiate throughout the Holy Land and the entire world.
I express my closeness to the sufferings of Christians in Palestine and Israel, and to all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. The growing climate of anti-Semitism throughout the world is worrisome. Yet at the same time, I think of the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.
I appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!
Let us pray for the Christian communities in Lebanon and in Syria, presently experiencing a delicate transition in its history. They aspire to stability and to participation in the life of their respective nations. I urge the whole Church to keep the Christians of the beloved Middle East in its thoughts and prayers.
I also think in particular of the people of Yemen, who are experiencing one of the world's most serious and prolonged humanitarian crises because of war, and I invite all to find solutions through a constructive dialogue.
May the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.
On this festive day, let us remember the South Caucasus and pray that a final peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan will soon be signed and implemented, and lead to long-awaited reconciliation in the region.
May the light of Easter inspire efforts to promote harmony in the western Balkans and sustain political leaders in their efforts to allay tensions and crises, and, together with their partner countries in the region, to reject dangerous and destabilising actions.
May the risen Christ, our hope, grant peace and consolation to the African peoples who are victims of violence and conflict, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan and South Sudan. May he sustain those suffering from the tensions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, as well as those Christians who in many places are not able freely to profess their faith.
There can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.
Nor is peace possible without true disarmament! The requirement that every people provide for its own defence must not turn into a race to rearmament.
The light of Easter impels us to break down the barriers that create division and are fraught with grave political and economic consequences. It impels us to care for one another, to increase our mutual solidarity, and to work for the integral development of each human person.
During this time, let us not fail to assist the people of Myanmar, plagued by long years of armed conflict, who, with courage and patience, are dealing with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Sagaing, which caused the death of thousands and great suffering for the many survivors, including orphans and the elderly. We pray for the victims and their loved ones, and we heartily thank all the generous volunteers carrying out the relief operations.
The announcement of a ceasefire by various actors in the country is a sign of hope for the whole of Myanmar.
I appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear which only leads to isolation from others, but rather to use the resources available to help the needy, to fight hunger and to encourage initiatives that promote development. These are the 'weapons' of peace: weapons that build the future, instead of sowing seeds of death!
May the principle of humanity never fail to be the hallmark of our daily actions. In the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity.
In this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!
Dear brothers and sisters,
In the Lord's Paschal Mystery, death and life contended in a stupendous struggle, but the Lord now lives forever (cf. Easter Sequence). He fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end, when the clash of arms and the rumble of death will be heard no more. Let us entrust ourselves to him, for he alone can make all things new (cf. Rev. 21:5)!
Happy Easter to everyone!"""
The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave,"Pope Francis's efforts to shake up the workings of the Church should be built on by the next pope, according to some - but his critics are less convinced",8 days ago,BBC InDepth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2de9d8dky0o,"The Vatican's Santa Marta guesthouse has 128 rooms. From 7 May, it will be filled with cardinals participating in the conclave to elect the next Pope. But one room in the guesthouse is still sealed with a red ribbon, as it has been since its occupant died there on Easter Monday.
That suite will only be reopened when the new pope is chosen. The ribbon remains a tangible reminder of the man whose shoes the cardinals are looking to fill – but Pope Francis' presence looms large over this conclave in many profound ways.
He spent 12 years in the role and appointed around 80% of the cardinals who will select his successor. He also looked to radically shake up the workings of the Catholic Church, moving its centre of gravity away from its hierarchy at the Vatican in the direction of the rank-and-file faithful all over the world, and focused on the poor and marginalised.
My conversations with cardinals and those assessing the needs of the Church in the days leading to this papal election almost always end up looking at what is required through the prism of what Pope Francis did in the role.
While in recent days there appears to have been a growing coalescence around the idea that Francis' work should be built on, some of his critics remain far from convinced. So might there be enough of them to sway the vote as the Church attempts to reconcile the different outlooks and realities it faces around the globe?
During the two weeks that followed the Pope's death, the cardinals met almost daily at the Vatican for pre-conclave gatherings known as general congregations.
While the conclave in the Sistine Chapel is limited to cardinals who haven't yet reached the age of 80 (133 will participate in this one), these preliminary meetings are open to all 252 cardinals. Each attendee was given up to five minutes to air their views, though we know that some took longer.
It was during such a meeting ahead of the last conclave of 2013, in a speech lasting less than four minutes, that Pope Francis - then known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina - made an impact, talking of a need to connect with those in the far reaches of the Catholic world.
As Pope, he made a conscious drive to appoint cardinals from such places. It is why this is the most diverse conclave there has ever been. For the first time Cape Verde, Haiti, South Sudan, Tonga, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda will be represented.
That diversity has already made its mark: the pre-conclave meetings are said to have brought to the fore just how different the needs of the Church appear to be depending on where in the world they are viewed.
In Europe, for example, a primary consideration for some might be finding ways to reinvigorate and make relevant the mission of the Church in the face of shrinking congregations, whereas elsewhere - in African or Asian countries - concerns may revolve around social issues, poverty and conflict resolution.
A prospective pope is likely to be one who has at least shown recognition of those very different realities.
The official titles that the new pope will inherit gives a sense of the breadth of the role: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City among them.
While some relate to the deeply spiritual, the last of those titles suggests the need for a statesman too, given that the pope is leader of a country, albeit the world's smallest.
""Unlike your average state, the agenda of the Vatican is driven to an extent by where the pope reigning at the time puts their emphasis,"" says Chris Trott, British ambassador to the Holy See. ""On the face of it a very tiny state, [but it is] one that punches many, many times above its weight.
""And Pope Francis had 50 million followers on Twitter, so [it is] a very, very small state and an incredible global influencer.""
Pope Francis chose to amplify this part of the role, becoming a powerful global spokesman on behalf of those on the margins, including the poor and victims of war.
He also tried to play the role of peacemaker, though not everyone thought he was successful in that regard, in relation to China and Russia in particular.
According to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic figure in England and Wales, this expansion of the role is one reason so many even outside the faith are invested in the outcome of the conclave.
""There is a sense that the Pope in the person of Pope Francis became a figure who addressed everybody in the world… religious people and even those who do not have a religious affiliation,"" he says.
""I'm more and more aware that it's not just Catholics who are interested in this.""
For many voting cardinals, it is primarily issues within the Catholic Church that are under the spotlight, which brings about the question of the type of pope they want as a manager, and someone who runs the Church's administrative body and its ministries.
While Pope Francis worked on improving the way the Church deals with the huge issues of sexual abuse and of financial corruption, it is his successor who will have to ensure that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world.
Even supporters of Pope Francis' efforts to make changes to the way the Church relates to its rank-and-file believers, and the way he built bridges with those outside the faith, were sometimes left confused about how exactly he envisioned things should work.
Pope Francis changed the tone on social issues through comments he made, talking openly about subjects ranging from climate change to financial transparency within the Vatican. But throughout his papacy, some were unclear about what he meant or how it would be applied.
One mission he had was to take some of the power and decision-making away from the Vatican hierarchy and into the hands of rank-and-file Catholics.
Over nearly four years, at great effort, he commissioned what was, in effect, a poll of many of the world's Catholics to find out what mattered to them. Lay people were invited to participate in the most recent bishop's conference where the results of the survey were discussed.
The biggest issues raised related to greater roles for women in the running of the church and welcoming LGBT+ Catholics. But the meeting ended in some confusion, with little in the form of tangible steps forward and little clarity as to how lay people will help steer the future direction of the Church.
So, there is a general keenness for greater clarity from the new pope.
Throughout his pontificate, some vocal traditionalists opposed what they saw as Pope Francis straying from Church teaching and long-standing tradition.
In the pre-conclave meetings of cardinals, a number of those over the age of 80 (who because of their age would not be involved in voting) took the opportunity to play their part.
Most contributions remained secret, but one that was reported was that of 83-year-old Italian cardinal, Beniamino Stella. He criticised Pope Francis for ""imposing his own ideas"" by attempting to move Church governance away from the clergy.
And yet during the homily, or religious speech, at Pope Francis' funeral, what appeared to resonate with the public in attendance – judging by the volume of the applause – was talk of the themes Francis chose to champion: the dignity of migrants, an end to war, and the environment.
This applause would have been heard loud and clear by the rows of cardinals.
In some senses, Pope Francis did have clarity in focusing on the Church being relevant to people in their daily lives and, indeed, their struggles. He was clear about connecting with the world outside the faith too.
""There is a sense that in the voice of the pope, there's a voice of something that is needed,"" says Cardinal Nichols. ""For some people it's a moral compass, for some people it's the sense of being accepted, for some people it's the insistence that we must look at things from the point of view of the poorest.
""That's a voice that has fallen silent and our task is to find someone who can carry that forward.""
From the death of Pope Francis to the moment cardinals checked into the Santa Marta guesthouse and its overflow residences, there appeared to be a trend towards a desire for continuity of what Pope Francis had achieved.
Though perhaps that vision of continuity is one that could bring along more of his sceptics, in a way that was pragmatic. The word ""unity"" has been talked of a lot, after a period where the divides between supporters and detractors of the Pope's vision could sometimes become ugly.
But in the end, when they step into the Sistine Chapel, the holiest of voting chambers, for all the pragmatism they may have taken into consideration before they cast their ballot, they will be urged to let God and the Holy Spirit guide them.

Street urination 'due to lack of public toilets',York City Council is set to review plans to introduce £100 fines to curb urination in the street.,16 Apr 2025,North Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5k9g8wz7o,"A lack of public toilets is one of the reasons people are urinating and defecating in York's streets, a report has found.
Almost 4,200 reports of street urination were recorded in 2023-2024 and City of York Council is set to review plans to introduce £100 fines.
A report to the executive committee, which will meet on 22 April, said the penalty was a more reasonable, proportionate and cost-effective way of punishing offenders than lengthy and expensive court proceedings.
Almost half of the people asked about urinating in the street blamed a lack of public toilets, it noted.
However, it added the provision of public toilets was an ongoing challenge.
""It is expensive and anti-social behaviour creates further difficulties in upholding cleansing and maintenance standards,"" the report said.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, York's Business Improvement District received 4,194 requests to clean up urine and 2,058 related to human biohazard fluid, such as vomit, in the 12 months to March.
There were 280 requests to clean up faeces, including from dogs, from the start of 2024 to November.
During a council consultation, 162 out of 346 people blamed the issue on a lack of public toilets and 83% of 1,026 respondents backed the £100 fines.
One respondent said: ""Urination and defecation in the streets is disgusting.
""But it happens mainly in the city centre where the lack of public toilets at certain times of the day lead to people taking desperate measures.""
The authority has recently spent £65,000 on upgrading public toilets in Silver Street in the city centre and Front Street in Acomb.
A further £254,000 had been made available to provide toilet, changing and shower spaces for the severely disabled.
The report added: ""Councillor Jenny Kent, the council's executive member for environment and climate emergency, is clear that access to clean toilets is an essential hallmark of public health, and the number, location and management of toilets is therefore currently under review.""

Rundown playgrounds will be spruced up with £1m,"Parents say one particular playground is shabby and ""neglected"".",10 Apr 2025,Essex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz955n19zz7o,"A £1m revamp of four playgrounds in a seaside city is on track, the local council has said.
Southend-on-Sea City Council said it was in the final stages of choosing a contractor and that work would start later this year.
Parents have pointed out that the Southchurch Park play area, which will benefit from the cash, has some equipment chained shut and several holes in the ground.
Lydia Hyde, the Labour cabinet member for climate, environment and waste, said the project would help ""ensure that every child has the opportunity to play"".
""These planned improvements will enhance the safety and accessibility of the play areas, creating welcoming and inclusive spaces for children of all ages and abilities,"" she said.
Southchurch Park, Bournes Green Park, Oakwood Park and Friars Park are all earmarked for refurbishments.
Hyde pointed out that a playground for children with additional needs was also being built at East Beach.
Southchurch Park is home to a lake, sports pitches, cafe and its playground.
Grandmother Sam Hoggar said she had been visiting there for close to five decades, but described its current state as ""neglected"" and ""dangerous"".
The 55-year-old says she brought her son to the park, and now brings her grandchildren.
""It's just such a shame - it used to be such a hive of activity, and it's somewhere where people can bring their children for free.
""But the way the equipment is at the moment, it's just not in a good state for the children.
""I just feel like the community deserves better.""
Grandmother Linda Nolan, 61, said of Southchurch Park: ""It has got worse over the years... little bit shabby, little bit tired.
Craig Covell, 39, was watching his child clamber up a slide that was closed at the top.
""It's definitely not what it used to be when I was growing up round here,"" he said.
Caleb Cowie, 35, added: ""You could easily sprain your ankle if you run and you never saw it.""

Election countdown - should Swinney be optimistic?,"The first minister will set out his programme for government this week, with a focus on steadying the ship.",4 May 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynzj1ezv4o,"Scotland's first minister John Swinney is not planning a party to celebrate his first anniversary in Holyrood's top political office. That's not really his style.
Instead of cake, balloons and fizzy wine he will mark this milestone by announcing an updated ""programme for government"" - as the countdown begins to the next Holyrood election in almost exactly a year's time.
As Swinney told me at a recent news conference, this is not about tearing up his existing programme and starting again but building on what's already there.
It's an opportunity for him to show that his focus is on the day job rather than on dreams of independence.
You can expect him to talk a lot about his four stated priorities: improving public services, growing the economy, reducing child poverty and tackling climate change.
Swinney specifically wants to deliver noticeable improvements in the NHS over the next 12 months.
That's not only because the public wants faster access to diagnosis and treatment but also because he believes cutting the queues is the best way to build trust with voters and to retain power.
He has also promised further economic action which in the short term could be about doing more to ease the cost of living pressures that many people feel.
On 7 May next year the public will pass judgement on what will by then be 19 years of the SNP in government in Scotland.
Voters will ultimately decide whether to keep John Swinney as first minister or kick him out.
The Conservatives, Labour and other opposition parties argue that the SNP's record in office requires a change of political direction.
They highlight long waits in the health service, high levels of drug deaths and new ferries arriving years overdue and seriously overbudget.
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has said that if the SNP knew how to solve Scotland's problems, they would have done it by now.
While Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay wants his party to be seen as a lower tax alternative to both the SNP and Labour.
Yet Swinney has greater cause for optimism about his political prospects now than he did a year ago.
There has been a remarkable shift in the Scottish political narrative since he replaced Humza Yousaf as first minister.
You may remember that Yousaf brought himself down by ending the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.
That set him up for a confidence vote that he no longer had sufficient support to win and he stood down as first minister.
Swinney's inheritance was challenging.
His was a party fractured over independence strategy, gender politics and environmental commitments plus the legacy of harassment complaints against the former first minister Alex Salmond that were mishandled by the Scottish government.
Then there was the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's finances which has since developed into a criminal prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell.
In July last year the SNP was heavily defeated by Labour in the UK general election but John Swinney, who had only just returned to the political frontline, escaped much of the blame.
It was not that his colleagues forgot that he had been at the heart of SNP government for most of the party's time in office.
It was that many saw him as the only figure with the knowledge, experience and political clout to manage the aftermath of such a major meltdown.
Swinney was elected party leader unopposed in May last year and moved quickly to patch up some of the divisions within the SNP by appointing Kate Forbes to his cabinet as deputy first minister.
There have been other changes too.
He no longer has a minister for independence, has shelved plans to pilot juryless rape trials and the creation of a new national care service has been dropped in all but name.
Swinney has skilfully worked to calm controversy and steady the ship.
The UK Supreme Court's decision on the definition of a woman under the Equality Act is another example.
The judges decided biological sex and not acquired gender was the answer.
Swinney immediately accepted the ruling as if it was a minor clarification of the law rather than a comprehensive defeat for the Scottish government by the campaign group For Women Scotland.
The Conservatives are determined that the fall-out from this legal battle at least merits an apology from the first minister to the women who took the case to court.
Instead, Swinney promises revised guidance on the provision and use of single-sex spaces and no attempt to revisit legislation to make it easier for trans people to legally change their gender.
He insists he will protect the rights of everyone in Scotland and hopes that will help him glide past this particular row.
The divisions in his party on this issue suggest his difficulties may not be so easily overcome, although the looming election may help bring different factions together.
Having watched his old boss Nicola Sturgeon finish her term in office as a deeply polarising figure, John Swinney is attempting to avoid the same fate.
That is why he is recasting himself as a unifying figure - someone prepared to reach out across party lines to work with others to get things done.
Yes, this is the same John Swinney who played a central role in the independence referendum that literally made voters choose between ""yes"" and ""no"" on the question of leaving the UK political union.
To be fair, the first minister demonstrated a capacity for more inclusive politics during the Scottish budget process, making sufficient concessions to other parties so that only the Scottish Conservatives voted against.
He presented his recent ""summit"" with political, faith and civic leaders to counter anti-democratic forces in a similar light.
However, his main rivals think that event, which excluded Reform UK, elevated Nigel Farage's party in the Scottish national debate.
Reform UK is persistently polling in double figures in Scotland and other pro-UK parties are worried.
While Swinney obviously despises Reform's hostility to both immigration and the pursuit of net zero, he also knows they are more likely to take votes from the Conservatives and Labour than the SNP.
After Reform's big gains in the English local elections on Thursday, there is a significant electoral test of their support in Scotland in just over a month.
The Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election on Thursday 5 June, following the death of SNP minister Christina McKelvie, will be widely seen as a two-horse race between the SNP and Labour.
This constituency vote has the capacity to entrench or overturn the prevailing narrative in Scottish politics - that Scottish Labour has lost momentum as a result of difficult decisions by the UK government on issues like welfare.
With a year to go, it looks perfectly possible that the SNP - far less popular than it has been in recent years - could still win a fifth term in office at Holyrood.
If the SNP can hold the Hamilton seat, their confidence will rise.
If Labour can take it from them, it will revive Anas Sarwar's sense that the public mood is for further political change.
Labour thinks they can win if the vote is a referendum on SNP performance in devolved government but they fear that if it becomes a vote of confidence in Labour's decision-making at UK level they will struggle.
The UK Labour government may have delivered record funding to the Scottish government but the SNP will not let the public forget the Treasury's cuts to the winter fuel payment for pensioners, which Scottish ministers plan to mitigate.
Scottish Labour could do with the UK government using its economic clout to help address challenges in Scotland.
They were delighted by the prime minister's promise of £200m to help secure a future for the Grangemouth industrial site but some in the party would like to see further intervention.
With the Hamilton by-election a month away, the Conservatives start as the third placed party.
They are worried that their new leader Russell Findlay has not had enough time to prevent Reform UK knocking them into fourth.
Whatever Reform's performance, all parties will want to analyse what it might mean if replicated at the Holyrood election where the voting system is designed to make it easier for smaller parties to gain seats.
Without a Scottish leader, a policy programme or an established organisational structure, Reform UK claims to have 10,000 members in Scotland who have turned to them because they are so fed up with politics as usual.
One further twist is that when Nigel Farage turns up to campaign in the by-election he is likely to face detailed questions on recent comments where he suggested he was relaxed about John Swinney continuing in power.
That may make his brand of politics less acceptable to pro-UK voters even though independence has slipped down the political agenda and there seems little prospect of another referendum anytime soon.
Farage's mission in Scotland he told the BBC is to gain a foothold at Holyrood, become part of the Scottish national conversation and then to replace the Conservatives.
That may help to explain why Russell Findlay is leaning more towards Reform UK positions in some policy areas.
For example, he recently called for a more affordable transition to a low carbon economy or what Reform calls ""net stupid zero"".
This type of Tory tilt, designed to stop their traditional supporters switching to Reform, has already cost the party the defection of MSP Jamie Greene to the Liberal Democrats - a significant coup for their leader Alex Cole-Hamilton.
The Scottish Greens who gained significant profile during their period in government and will attract further attention when they elect a new co-leader to replace Patrick Harvie in the summer are among the range of other parties contesting the by-election and the Holyrood campaign in 2026.
Senior SNP figures tell me that independence will feature in their national campaign and ministers have promised one further paper completing their independence prospectus in the coming months.
That said, only the most optimistic independence supporter would predict another referendum in the next five years if there's a ""yes"" majority at Holyrood after the 2026 election.
The issue is not dead but it certainly feels more dormant than at any time over the past decade.
The less that constitutional politics is to the fore, the more space there will be to discuss the competing offers from rival parties on the domestic issues over which Holyrood has control.
That's health, education, law and order, parts of welfare, transport, the environment and some aspects of the economy.
Then there is global uncertainty.
Politics at home is vulnerable to the impact of global issues, whether that's import tariffs from the US President Donald Trump or the effects of conflicts in the Middle East, Ukraine or elsewhere.
Some of these issues may change the context in which domestic debates take place. Others could impact on the UK economy directly or as a knock-on effect.
The US president and his vice-president JD Vance have been known to speak up for their preferred candidates in other people's elections.
That's what John Swinney did when he suggested US voters back Donald Trump's principal opponent Kamala Harris. Don't be surprised if the Trump administration returns the compliment.
There's no reason to think the first minister would lose sleep having President Trump against him or having Nigel Farage as a foil. Both could help motivate his political base.
No-one in Scottish politics can take anything for granted. A lot can change in a year and uncertainty is likely to be a hallmark of the campaign to come.
John Swinney and his rivals for the job of first minister are probably best advised to keep their fizzy wine on ice."
Garden centres get ready for busy long weekend,"Spring sunshine sees trade in plants step up in and businesses say the weather ""drives everything"".",17 Apr 2025,Hereford & Worcester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807g3v571do,"Plant growers and sellers have been getting ready for the busy Bank Holiday weekend – traditionally the point in the year when many people want to get their gardens in shape.
Spring sunshine has seen sales in plants rise in Worcestershire, with businesses saying the weather ""drives everything"".
At local Bransford Webb Plant Company, where a 45-acre site grows two million plants a year from seed to saplings, the team has been potting about 1,600 plants an hour to keep up with demand.
With sunny spells forecast by the Met Office this weekend, amid some changeable and wet weather, companies are hoping for potentially record-breaking sales.
David Chilvers, sales and marketing director at the Bransford Webb Plant Company, said: ""If you went back six weeks from now, we're at the end of February, early March, it was grey, it was damp.
""People couldn't get out in their gardens because it was too wet after a wet winter, and equally plants weren't growing much because the light levels and temperatures weren't there.""
He said that getting to mid-March, the temperatures have increased, adding: ""It's gone dry, people are out gardening, garden centres are seeing a massive footfall increase - and then we've seen that turn into sales as people convert that into plant deliveries.""
Plants leaving the sheds at his company are heading to garden centres up and down the country, including family-owned Laylocks Garden Centre in Worcester, which had its best March in 43 years last month.
Hannah Warr, director at Laylocks, said the recent sunshine had brought in the customers and they were expecting a busy weekend over Easter.
She said everyone wanted to be in their gardens as soon as the weather turned warmer.
She added: ""They see a huge space outside to use and they're inspired as soon as the sun starts to shine. They want to come here and decorate.""

Green GEN Cymru wants to raise miles of pylons through rural Wales to tackle the energy, climate and cost-of-living crisis.
Owners of three farms, all from Carmarthenshire, said at Llanelli Magistrates Court on Monday they would now sign licences to grant access.
The energy company's application for two further warrants has been adjourned to 22 April.
Caerfyrddin MP Ann Davies and Members of the Senedd (MS) Adam Price and Cefin Campbell were among about 80 campaigners outside Llanelli Magistrates' Court in support of the landowners.
The farmers, from near Llandovery and Llanarthney, own land in the path of a proposed 56-mile power line between a new windfarm at Nant Mithil in Powys and planned substation at Llandyfaelog, near Carmarthen.
That Tywi-Usk line is one of three major routes of pylons in Powys, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, being proposed by Green GEN Cymru.
Protesters have argued for the lines to be installed underground to protect the natural beauty of the areas.
Cymdeithas yr Iaith – the Welsh language Society – also criticised an initial decision not to allow the hearing to be conducted in Welsh.
Evidence can be given in Welsh in court but a request must be made to the judge for documentation or court proceedings to be held in Welsh.
District judge Mark Layton recommended that his colleague Gwyn Jones conducted the hearing in Welsh via videolink and will do so again later this month.
Mr Price, Plaid Cymru MS for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said after the hearing: ""It felt like David and Goliath today. A corporate giant with very large and, no doubt, expensive team of lawyers faced with objectors that were farming families, many of them are elderly and have never been in this position before.""
According to Owen Jones, external affairs manager for Green GEN Cymru, putting cables underground for the whole pylon route was ""not a possibility"".
Green GEN Cymru is urging people to give ""specific feedback"" on where undergrounding is needed, but Mr Jones said evidence showed it was ""at least five times more expensive"" for the whole route to be placed underground.
""You are talking hundreds of millions [of pounds] in additional costs and that is unviable,"" he added.
""We can't underground everything, but we are always asking for feedback."""
Think about slavery before buying cheap clothes - ex-PM,The former prime minister says the issue of modern slavery has fallen down the political agenda.,15 Apr 2025,Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v93yx92w4o,"Fast fashion shoppers need to think about where cheap clothes comes from before they make purchases, former Prime Minister Theresa May has said as she warned that the topic of modern slavery had slipped down the political agenda.
Speaking to Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said some companies were actively checking their supply chains to make sure slave labour had not been used and reflecting that ""on their packaging"".
She said consumers needed to be more aware of how items were produced and to ""think about it before they buy"".
May said modern slavery was ""the greatest human rights issue of our time"" but also ""destabilises economies"".
She added that governments needed to understand that forced labour created volatility in supply chains and ""distorts"" competition.
The former Conservative leader now leads the Global Commission on Modern Slavery Human which has produced a report on ending the practice.
The report estimates that 50 million men, women and children are ""trapped in slavery"" around the world and says government, businesses, civil society and the public needed to work together to eradicate the practice.
It calls for businesses to embed ""human rights due diligence"" in all its operations and to take action where problems were identified.
Speaking to Woman's Hour, Baroness May said there was ""a complete lack of awareness about the fact that slavery exists in these numbers around the world.
""When there is a cost of living crisis you look for that cheap fashion, you don't ask where it comes from.
""How many of us actually ask where our clothes are made? Where are products are made when we're buying them?
""There are some companies that are now actively taking the opportunity to look at supply chains, they'll make sure they are fair, they will reflect that on their packaging.
""But it is really an awareness raising it needs, for people to look out for [the packaging], to know what's happening and to think about it before they buy.""
Theresa May is known for her love of fashion and received gifts from designers including Stella McCartney but in accordance with government rules she paid for items she wanted to keep.

In recent years some retailers such as the Chinese fashion giant Shein have been accused of using forced labour in its supply chains.
In 2024, it promised to tighten scrutiny after finding two cases of child labour at its suppliers.
At a parliamentary committee hearing earlier this year, a senior lawyer for Shein said the company complied with ""laws and regulations in the countries we operate in"" and that suppliers were required to sign up to robust standards.
The company is currently looking to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange.
May said modern slavery had recently ""fallen down the political agenda"" and that she wanted to boost efforts to tackle it.
Asked why she thought the subject was receiving less attention, she said ""governments often find it difficult to concentrate of lots of things at the same time"" and that other issues such as climate change, conflict and Covid received greater focus.
Tackling modern slavery was a particular focus of May's when she was home secretary and later prime minister.
In 2015, she passed the Modern Slavery Act which introduced new powers aimed at protecting victims and prosecuting offenders.
The law introduced a new defence for victims of slavery and trafficking who had been forced to break the law.
Following its introduction there was an increase in convictions for modern slavery offences.
However, Home Office ministers subsequently raised concern that the law was being abused by those in the UK illegally, who wanted to avoid deportation.
In 2022, the Conservative government, then led by Boris Johnson introduced changes aimed at helping decision makers identify genuine victims of modern slavery."
What do Americans think of Trump's foreign policies?,"Most Americans do not believe the US should try to take over Greenland or Gaza, a Pew Research survey suggests.",8 Apr 2025,US & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vejvjwp0o,"In his first few weeks back in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump made several extraordinary decisions on foreign policy.
He threatened to annex Greenland, announced plans to ""take over"" Gaza, and started to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Paris climate agreement. He has also shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the government's main overseas aid agency.
Many of these moves are not very popular with ordinary Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre. It surveyed 3,605 US adults in late March - just before Trump imposed sweeping trade tariffs on countries around the world.
Here are four takeaways from the Pew research.
Trump has increased his rhetoric on ""getting"" Greenland, and Vice-President JD Vance recently took a controversial trip to the Arctic island.
But Pew found that most survey respondents (54%) did not think the US should take over the Danish territory. When asked if they think Trump would actually pursue the plan, 23% thought it was extremely likely, but a greater number (34%) said they believed he would not carry through with it.
Trump also proposed an American takeover of the Gaza Strip, resettling two million Palestinians in neighbouring countries with no right of return. This would violate international law and has been described as ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"" by the UN.
Of those surveyed, 62% of Americans opposed such a move, compared to 15% who favoured it. Opinions were divided as to whether Trump was likely to actually pursue it. Again, the greater number (38%) thought it very or extremely unlikely.
Trump signed executive orders to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on climate change, and said USAID largely would be shut down.
More Americans disapprove than approve of such moves, the survey suggests - although the results are not a landslide.
At the start of his second presidency, Trump said he would ""work together, very closely"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine - a very different approach to that of his predecessor, Joe Biden.
The Pew research found 43% of respondents thought Trump favoured Russia too much - a higher number than the 31% who said he was striking the right balance between both sides.
Since the survey was conducted, however, Trump's mood appears to have changed. He has said he is ""very angry"" with Putin over Ukraine negotiations.
Meanwhile, Trump's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown increasingly close this year.
Answering a question about whether Trump was favouring Israelis or Palestinians, 31% of those surveyed thought he favoured Israelis too much. Close behind at 29% were those who thought Trump was striking the right balance.
Larger than either of these, however, was the group of respondents who were not sure (37%). Just 3% felt he was favouring  Palestinians too much.
While Pew Research Centre is non-partisan, those surveyed were not.
The results showed that most of the respondents (64%) who described themselves as Republican - or Republican-leaning - supported the move by the Republican president to end USAID, for example.
That compared to just 9% of opposing Democrats - or Democratic-leaning - respondents who felt the same way, indicating a high level of polarisation.
Generally, it is older adults who support Trump's foreign policy actions, more than younger adults, the research suggested.
Pew also asked about tariffs on China, although this research was carried out before the situation escalated sharply into the trade war that is now under way.
Generally, more Americans said the tariffs would be bad for them personally, but those who were Republican, or leant more towards that party, believed the tariffs would benefit the US."
What the Romans did for Europe's woods,The chestnut trees of Europe tell a hidden story charting the fortunes of ancient Rome and the legacy it left in the continent's forests.,5 hrs ago,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250513-what-chestnuts-reveal-about-the-roman-empire,"The chestnut trees of Europe tell a hidden story charting the fortunes of ancient Rome and the legacy it left in the continent's forests.
The ancient Romans left an indelible imprint on the world they enveloped into their empire. The straight, long-distance roads they built can still be followed beneath the asphalt of some modern highways. They spread aqueducts, sewers, public baths and the Latin language across much of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. But what's perhaps less well known is the surprising way they transformed Europe's forests.
According to researchers in Switzerland, the Romans had something of a penchant for sweet chestnut trees, spreading them across Europe. But it wasn't so much the delicate, earthy chestnuts they craved – instead, it was the fast-regrowing timber they prized most, as raw material for their empire's expansion. And this led to them exporting tree cultivation techniques such as coppicing too, which have helped the chestnut flourish across the continent.
""The Romans' imprint on Europe was making it into a connected, economical space,"" says Patrik Krebs, a geographer at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL). ""They built a single system of governance all over Europe, they improved the road system, the trade system, the military system, the connection between all the different people all over Europe.""
As a result of that connection, ""specific skills in arboriculture [the cultivation of trees] were shared by all the different civilisations"", he says.
The arboreal legacy of the Romans can still be found today in many parts of Europe – more than 2.5 million hectares (6 million acres) of land are covered by sweet chestnut trees, an area equivalent in size to the island of Sardinia. The trees have become an important part of the landscape in many parts of the continent and remain part of the traditional cuisine of many countries including France and Portugal.
Krebs works at a branch of the WSL in Switzerland's Ticino canton on the southern slope of the Alps, an area that is home to giant chestnut trees, where many specimens have girths greater than seven metres (23ft). By the time of the Middle Ages, sweet chestnuts were a staple food in the area. But it was the Romans who brought the trees there – before their arrival in Ticino, sweet chestnuts did not exist there, having been locally wiped out in the last ice age, which ended more than 10,000 years ago.
Using a wide range of evidence, including paleoecological pollen records and ancient Roman texts, Krebs' research team analysed the distribution of both sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and walnut (Juglans regia) trees in Europe before, during and after the Roman empire. Sweet chestnut and walnut trees are considered useful indicators of the human impact on a landscape, as they generally benefit from human management – such as pruning and supressing competing trees. Their fruits and timber are also highly desirable.
In countries such as Switzerland, France and parts of Germany, sweet chestnut pollen was near-absent from the wider pollen record – such as, for example, fossil pollen found in sediment and soil samples – before the Romans arrived, according to the study and previous research. But as the Roman Empire expanded, the presence of sweet chestnut pollen grew. Specifically, the percentage of sweet chestnut pollen relative to other pollen across Europe ""shows a pattern of a sudden increase around year zero [0AD], when the power of the Roman empire was at its maximum"" in Europe, Krebs says.
After the Barbarian sacks of Rome around 400-500 AD, which signalled the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire amid widespread upheaval, the chestnut pollen percentage then drops temporarily. This decrease suggests that many of the Roman-era orchards were abandoned, Krebs says, probably not only due to the fall of the Roman Empire, but also, because a wider population decline in many areas at the time.
""Juglans [walnut] has a different pattern,"" says Krebs. The spread of pollen from these trees is less clearly associated with the rise and fall of the Roman empire, he and his colleagues found. Its distribution around Europe had already increased before the arrival of the Romans, perhaps pointing to the ancient Greeks and other pre-Roman communities as playing a role.
But while the Romans can perhaps take credit for spreading the sweet chestnut around mainland Europe, some separate research suggests they were not behind the arrival of these trees in Britain. Although the Romans have previously been credited with bringing sweet chestnuts to the British isles – where they are still a key part of modern woodlands – research by scientists at the University of Gloucestershire in the UK found the trees were probably introduced to the island later.
Sweet chestnut trees can be striking features of the landscape. They can grow up to 35m (115ft) tall and can live for up to 1,000 years in some locations. Most of those alive today will not have been planted by the Romans, but many will be descendants or even cuttings taken from those that ancient Roman legionnaires and foresters brought with them to the far-flung corners of the empire. The oldest known sweet chestnut tree in the world is found in Sicily, Italy, and is thought to be up to 4,000 years old.
Why did the Romans so favour the sweet chestnut tree? According to Krebs, they did not tend to value the fruit much – in Roman culture, it was portrayed as a rustic food of poor, rural people in Roman society, such as shepherds. But the Roman elites did appreciate sweet chestnut's ability to quickly sprout new poles when cut back, a practice known as coppicing. This speedy regrowth came in handy given the Romans' constant need for raw materials for their military expansion.
""Ancient texts show that the Romans were very interested in Castanea, especially for its resprouting capacity,"" he says. ""When you cut it, it resprouts very fast and produces a lot of poles that are naturally very high in tannins, which makes the wood resistant and long-lasting. You can cut this wood and use it for building fortresses, for any kind of construction, and it quickly sprouts again.""
Coppicing can also have a rejuvenating effect on the chestnut tree, even after decades of neglect.
In Ticino, chestnut trees became more and more dominant under the Romans, according to the pollen record. They remained popular even after the Roman Empire fell, Krebs says.
One explanation for this is that locals had learned to plant and care for the tree from the Romans, and then came to appreciate chestnuts as a nourishing, easy-to-grow food – by the Middle Ages, they had become a staple food in many parts of Europe. The chestnuts, for example, could be dried and ground into flour. Mountain communities would also have welcomed the fact that the trees thrived even on rocky slopes, where many other fruit trees and crops struggled, Krebs adds.
""The Romans' achievement was to bring these skills from far away, to enable communication between people and spread knowledge,"" he says. ""But the real work of planting the chestnut tree orchards was probably done by local populations.""
When they are cultivated in an orchard for their fruit, sweet chestnut trees benefits from management such as pruning dead or diseased wood, as well as the lack of competition, all of which prolong their life, Krebs says: ""In an orchard, there's just the chestnut tree and the meadow below, it's like a luxury residence for the tree. Whereas when the orchard is abandoned, competitor trees arrive and take over.""
More like this:
• How donkeys changed the course of human history
• The ancient Roman alternative to daylight saving time
• Searching for the Old Ones: Where to find the world's oldest trees
Research on abandoned chestnut orchards has shown that when left alone, chestnut trees are crowded out by other species. In wild forests, ""Castanea reaches a maximum age of about 200 years, then it dies,"" Krebs says. ""But here in Ticino, where chestnuts have been cultivated, they can reach up to almost 1,000 years, because of their symbiosis with humans.""
By the end of the Roman era, the sweet chestnut had become the dominant tree species in Ticino, displacing a previous forest-scape of alders and other trees, the pollen record shows: ""This was done by humans. It was a complete reorganisation of the vegetal landscape,"" Krebs explains.
In fact, pollen evidence from a site in Ticino at some 800m (2,625ft) above sea level shows that during the Roman period there was a huge increase in Castanea pollen, as well as cereal and walnut-tree pollen, suggesting an orchard was kept there, Krebs says. (Read more about the traces left by passing Romans and other ancient civilisations in the Alps.)
By the Middle Ages, long after the Romans were gone, many historical texts document the dominance of sweet chestnut production and the importance of foods such as chestnut flour in Ticino, says Krebs. ""In our valleys, chestnuts were the most important pillar of subsistence during the Middle Ages.""
People in Ticino continued to look after the trees, planting them, coppicing them, pruning them and keeping out the competition, over centuries, Krebs says: ""That's the nature of this symbiosis: humans get the fruit [and wood] of the chestnut tree – and the chestnut gets longevity"", as well as the opportunity to hugely extend its natural area of distribution, he explains.
A similar transfer of chestnut-related knowledge to locals may have happened elsewhere in the Roman Empire, he suggests – and possibly left linguistic traces. As a separate study shows, across Europe, the word for ""chestnut"" is similar to the Latin ""castanea"" in many languages.
Today, Europe's sweet chestnut trees are facing threats including disease, climate change and the abandonment of traditional orchards as part of the decline in rural life. But chestnut trails and chestnut festivals in Ticino and other parts of the southern Alps still celebrate the history of sweet chestnuts as a past staple food – reminding us of the long legacy of both Roman and local ideas and skills in tree-care.

Energy-efficient neighbourhood scheme launches,Wolverhampton City Council says a £545k grant will help it form a plan to implement across the city.,15 Apr 2025,Wolverhampton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pepy195xo,"A pilot project has been launched to make a neighbourhood in Wolverhampton more energy-efficient, with the results to be fed into a wider project for the city, the council says.
The authority has been given £545,502 by the West Midlands Combined Authority to trial measures on a ""small cluster"" of streets in Graiseley.
Residents will be given energy advice, retrofit assessments and supported with low-cost energy-saving improvements.
The findings of the pilot will lead to a model that can benefit the whole city – helping cut energy bills and make energy supplies more resilient, the council said.
The pilot neighbourhood includes Lime Street, Fisher Street, Bristol Street, Manlove Street, Cardiff Street and Bingley Street, and sections of Lea Road, Owen Road, Burleigh Road, Norfolk Road, and Merridale Street West.
The council will liaise with residents and businesses to investigate how measures such as home energy improvements, smart energy systems, active travel, community events and better green spaces can improve lives.
There will be a series of public events within the area that will be advertised in the coming weeks, the authority said.
Councillor Qaiser Azeem, cabinet member for transport and green city at the council, said: ""I am delighted we have secured this funding and am excited to see the opportunities and benefits it can bring and the lessons we can learn as part of our collaborative, city-wide Our Net Zero City 2041 efforts with communities and technical advisors.
""We want residents and businesses to be well informed and empowered to take climate action that can make a positive difference to their lives, and they will be at the centre of making this project a success.""
The council's deputy leader councillor, Steve Evans, said the authority wanted to create neighbourhoods with more energy-efficient homes and reduce fuel poverty for vulnerable residents.
""The data-gathering phase of this trailblazing project will allow us to see how measures such as better insulation or rooftop solar panels and heat pumps could make a big difference to lives,"" he said.

A new pope is coming. Is the US embracing faith?,BBC Special Correspondent Katty Kay and author Ross Douthat discuss the state of religion and what could come with a new pope as cardinals convene at the Vatican for a conclave.,7 days ago,Business,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20250507-new-pope-catholicism-america-ross-douthat-katty-kay-interview,"Starting today – for however long it takes – hundreds of Catholic cardinals will sequester themselves in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican to select the next pope.
The death of Pope Francis and the ensuing attention on the Catholic Church – with a real-life secretive conclave, not just a Hollywood movie version – comes amid a bit of good news for organised religion in the United States.
For decades, the number of religious believers in the US, especially Christian believers, had been declining. But that decline has stopped recently, and there are signs that the US may be toying with a religious revival.
There are similar signs of growth in other parts of the world. In England and Wales, the number of young adults who say they go to church once a month has increased 400% in the last six years. In France, the Catholic Church conducted 45% more baptisms this Easter than last year, a surge largely fuelled by young adults.
The person that I wanted to speak to about the state of faith and Catholicism at this particular moment is Ross Douthat. He's a columnist for the New York Times who's just written a new book, Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious. In the book, Ross makes the case for why people might benefit from following one of the major world religions – even if it's not his own.
Ross is both an American and a Catholic – so our conversation touches on the conclave in Rome as well as the state of religion in the US.
I really enjoyed our conversation – I'd encourage you to watch (or read) more of it below.
Below is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.
Katty Kay: I'm wondering if you could just start by giving us a sort of picture of faith today in America.
Ross Douthat: America has gone through a 20-year period of secularisation in which church attendance has declined, religious identification and belonging has declined more sharply. More Americans than ever before say they have no religious affiliation.
But we've also entered in the last few years into a kind of pause in that trajectory. The rate of secular Americans has stopped going up. There's some modest evidence of religious revival, but really the best way to think about it is that America isn't having a religious revival. It's sort of considering whether to have one. That's the phrase I've been using.
KK: [Laughter] It's dipping its toe into the faith pond.
RD: Yes! I think one way to think about it, too, is that institutional religion in the US has never been weaker – or at least not in modern American history. You have the first big generation in our history, that's been raised without even a sort of Christmas and Easter – or Sunday school kind of exposure to religious faith.
But in an interesting way, that's making some of them more open to religion and religious questions than their parents or grandparents would have been, because they don't have this sort of memory of a kind of oppressive-seeming institutional framework. But that impulse can go in all kinds of directions.
So, you could easily imagine some sort of explicit revival where more people go to church, more people belong to Christian denominations. But it could also just be a kind of more purely individualistic thing, where you have lots more interest in spiritualism, the occult, UFOs, a very 1970s sort of landscape. I think both of those scenarios are there on the table, but we don't know fully what direction the culture is going.
KK: I never met Pope Francis, but his whole ethos was a church that was more inclusive, less hierarchical. As a Jesuit, he protected the poor and the masses. When you look at his role over the last few years and who he brought into or did not bring into the Catholic Church, how would you quantify his papacy?
RD: It's hard to quantify a papacy, but I think that's right, that the pope was sceptical or hostile to some of the forms of conservative and even traditionalist Catholicism that have often been unexpectedly successful in winning over college graduates and more elite Westerners. He saw Catholicism, ideally, as a faith more for the masses. But he saw that happening primarily, I think, through a kind of liberalisation and a certain kind of accommodation with modern culture.
But in a way, the story I would tell is that while Francis wanted the church to be more competitive with those non-denominational evangelical kinds of churches, the particular form of more liberal Catholicism that he partially embodied is actually less appealing, seemingly. It sort of loses people at both ends. It loses people both to non-denominational churches and to more conservative forms of faith.
So, I think he was a tremendously charismatic and influential figure as an embodiment of the church on the global stage. But I think the particular model of Roman Catholicism that he embraced is actually likely to decline further in the future.
KK: That brings us very neatly to the conclave, which is just starting and has kind of become the greatest political religious show on earth. Thank you to Robert Harris and his very successful movie with Ralph Fiennes.
RD: Well, he was building on material that the church had already supplied! [Laughter] Let's give Catholicism its due!
KK: So, the shtick about American politics is that it's a pendulum, or at least that's been the shtick to date. It swings one way and then it swings the other way. I don't know if this is even an interesting or an appropriate analogy, but you've hinted at some of that in your last answer, that you think that the Catholic Church may now be at some sort of a juncture. Where does it go? Does it carry on the tradition of Pope Francis or are we going to see a shift to something more conservative, more dogmatic?
RD: So, to the extent that you can handicap a papal election, and to be clear, I believe you can be excommunicated for betting on one –
KK: [Laughter] OK, it's a secret between you and me, then!
RD: [Laughter] No one will see this, right?
I think if you were to speculate, you would say that a lot of leaders of the Catholic Church would like a modest course correction from where Francis went. They would think to themselves, 'OK, we don't want a hard swing towards any kind of traditionalism. But we think Francis sort of went too far in, in fact, some of his wars on traditionalists, his attempt to ban the traditional Latin mass, and also in his enthusiasm for sort of constantly opening up fraught subjects for debate.' So, I think rather than a pendulum swing, I think a lot of cardinals would be looking for some kind of figure who was seen as a moderate, who could sort of hold the church together, because one thing Francis did was sort of make the liberal factions in the church demand more and the conservative factions rebel.
So, the gulf between the liberal Catholic Church in Germany and the more conservative churches in sub-Saharan Africa, that gap is pretty wide right now. So again, you wouldn't expect cardinals to say, we want the traditionalists, we want Benedict XVI, but more so you'd expect them to want someone who could sort of not rock the boat too much and hold things together.
Feeding the conclave
The process of choosing a new pope is so secretive, even the meals that cardinals eat have to be closely monitored. When messages could be slipped between noodles, ravioli is off the menu. For more conclave context, read our story about how the Catholic Church feeds these would-be popes.
However, the other reality is that Pope Francis picked cardinals from all over the world in ways that didn't follow at all the normal pattern of picking cardinals. Instead of picking cardinals from the big cities, you know, the big archbishops and so on, he picked people who just sort of struck him in different ways. And it isn't always clear that they had any kind of theological or ideological consistency. So, you have all these cardinals coming in, many of whom have never met one another. He didn't hold a lot of meetings of cardinals.
And I think that means that saying, 'Oh, the cardinals want a moderate,' maybe works as a generalisation, but it doesn't actually tell you a lot about how these men are going to think and vote and operate once they're thrown together for the first time. So, that places a limit on all handicapping. What people might say they want in theory could end up yielding something very different when they actually come together and vote.
KK: OK, I absolutely don't want to be responsible for your excommunication, so we'll leave the handicapping at that –
RD: [Laughter] Well, you know, I didn't lay odds, so I'm in good shape.
KK: Ross, your new book is Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious. Why did you write this book now? We live in a world, where there is an awful lot of chaos and lack of belief in institutions and people feel confused by technological, political, climate changes that are happening around us. Did you feel that was a backdrop against which your argument might fall on friendly ears?
RD: To some degree, yes. I think that there's a reason that writers like Dawkins and the other new atheists found a friendly audience 20 years ago. I think it had to do with the aftermath of September 11, a fear of religious fanaticism, opposition to George W. Bush and sort of evangelical politics. I think they picked a good opening, a good moment. And I think this is a moment 20 years on where people are less confident that a world without religion is going in a positive direction.
I do think there is a certain amount of evidence that actual religious practice does have an effect on the individual, right? Especially studies related to the Mormon Church and other places where you have sort of really strong communitarian religious cultures. It does seem to have a real effect even for people on the margins in terms of their behaviour, whether they get addicted to drugs, or these kinds of things. But what is definitely true is that you're never going to sustain a religious culture just on the promise that it's good for you to go to church.
And this is one of the points and arguments that I make in the book is that in the end, if you're going to get a religious revival, people have to be convinced that it's not just good for you, but that it's actually true and real, right? That in fact, you have to be persuaded that God is real and wants you to go to church, not just it's going to help increase your social capital and psychological well-being by 3.7%.
We're very comfortable, especially journalists in sort of secular spaces, talking about how religion is good for you, because it's something that the secular person can sort of concede and understand.
KK: And there's data. We like data points.
RD: You can measure it. And in America, you know, everything, we quote Alexis de Tocqueville at the drop of a hat. We're like, 'Tocqueville said religion was good for you. But in the end, that is too limited a case'. And I think it is important for religious arguers, myself obviously included, to sort of go a bit further and say, 'you know, there's almost certainly a God and [you're] probably going to meet him when you die and you should take that into account for your Sunday morning choices or Saturday choices,' as well.
The other thing I'd say though is that I do think that a lot of people who are agnostic or who are interested in religion but think it's sort of anti-science or unreasonable and so on have not fully kept up with some of the stranger directions that our understanding of the laws of the universe have gone, the sort of peculiar fine-tuning of the universe to allow for human life, the debates about the nature of consciousness. And I think some of those debates have gone in a direction that's quite friendly to religious ideas. And so, it's worth sort of explaining that and arguing that at this moment, saying that actually, you know, the militant atheist is, you know, is not quite the representative of scientific certainty that maybe people assume that he is.
KK: You advocate for organised religious faith, not the kind of, as you vaguely referenced, California-style mysticism, not to disparage California. Of course, our friends there might well be religious, too.
RD: I was born in San Francisco, so you know, I can't speak ill.
KK: Is it a curious position for somebody who is a practicing Catholic to find themselves in, to be advocating for other religious faiths with which you may have some things in common, but a lot not in common.
RD: Yes, I mean, I think there's obviously a kind of delicacy to the argument where I'm simultaneously saying as a Catholic Christian, I think that my religion has the fullness of truth and in an ideal world, I would persuade you of that. But also recognising that, you know, the realities of pluralism, the complexities and difficulties of any human life, the fact that there are long-standing religious debates that no single author or arguer is going to settle.
All of that means that you need to be open to the idea that a movement towards religion is going to move some people into my own faith, and some people into other faiths, and it's OK to argue for that, right? To sort of say, look, I want you to come all the way with me, but if you come part way and end up in a somewhat different place, that's still better than sitting forever in atheism or agnosticism.
But I do sincerely think that in a pluralist society, everyone is not going to convert to the same religion, and it would be a good thing if more people moved into the terrain of serious religious practice.

Endangered axolotl release raises hopes for rare amphibian,"Study provides hope for future of the axolotl amphibian, pushed to the brink of extinction in Mexico.",30 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xr2jzelyo,"One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.
In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.
The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they ""survived and foraged successfully at both sites"" - even gaining weight.
Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an ""amazing result"".
The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.
The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.
But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.
""If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,"" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.
It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.
""If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,"" Dr Zambrano continued, ""I feel that we have hope for humanity.""
To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland ""refuges"" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,
The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an ""artificial wetland"".
Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.
""The amazing news is that they all survived,"" Dr Ramos told BBC News. ""And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.""
The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. ""We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,"" Dr Ramos explained.
Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.
But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.
""Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,"" said Dr Ramos. ""And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.
""You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out."""
Food hubs receive another year of funding,The seven hubs in West Sussex will now continue until April 2026 thanks to the council funding.,7 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn91xnqgdg5o,"Seven community food hubs will continue for another year thanks to funding from the local county council.
The West Sussex hubs, which started as a six-month pilot in October 2022, have been extended until April 2026.
The scheme, run in partnership with Sussex-based food rescue charity UKHarvest, redistributes surplus food from suppliers while educating residents on food waste prevention.
Deborah Urquhart, West Sussex County Council's cabinet member for environment and climate change, said: ""We're proud to support this valuable service, helping residents access good-quality food that would otherwise go to waste.""
The hubs set up once a month in each district and borough across West Sussex, and for a voluntary donation of £5, residents can access a selection of surplus food.
No referrals are needed and all residents are welcome to visit the hubs, which also provide advice and recipe ideas.
The hubs have stopped more than 94 tonnes of food from going to waste since April 2023, the council said.
Nigel Boshein, UKHarvest's community food hubs manager, said the council-funded pop-ups also meant an extra 1,136 people could receive food each month.

Free parking initiative to boost high street shops,Worthing Borough Council says this scheme will support local businesses which are facing challenges.,7 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807l9p11ylo,"Residents and visitors can take advantage of free parking in an effort to support high street businesses, says a West Sussex council.
Worthing Town Centre Business Improvement District (BID) and Worthing Borough Council are working with Hemiko, the developer of the low-carbon project Worthing Heat Network, to encourage people to shop locally.
Hemiko said it agreed with the council to sponsor free parking at the High Street multi-storey car park on the first and last Sunday of the month from April until July.
Councillor Rita Garner, Worthing's cabinet member for regeneration, said the council recognised the current climate for high street businesses was ""challenging"".
""We hope the free parking offer will be a great incentive for residents and visitors to come and support Worthing's traders and the many events happening in the town,"" she said.
Hemiko said the free parking dates coincided with several free events including the Worthing Street Market Party and VE Day Celebrations on 4 May.
A spokesperson said the company had also rescheduled the planned Worthing Heat Network works outside the High Street multi-storey car park, which were originally set to take place from 14 to 17 April.
They added this was to avoid impacting businesses in the lead-up to the Easter weekend. The works will be moved to a later date.
Chris Horner, project manager at Hemiko, said: ""We understand the importance of supporting our local businesses, especially during times of disruption.
""By rescheduling our works and sponsoring free parking, we hope to make a positive contribution to growth in the town centre.""
Hannah Manzaroli, manager of Worthing Town Centre BID, added: ""Free parking is a fantastic way to encourage more people to visit, shop, and enjoy everything our businesses have to offer.""

Two more Metro trains arrive at depot,Tyne and Wear Metro bosses say the new fleet will be fully operational by the end of 2026.,14 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8207dd74go,"Two new Tyne and Wear Metro trains have arrived in the north-east of England as part of a £362m fleet expected to be in service by the end of next year.
The 16th and 17th units in the Stadler fleet, out of a total 46 to be built, were delivered to the Metro's Gosforth depot early on Friday.
The first of the Swiss-made trains entered service in December as the modern carriages are gradually rolled out.
Five of the new fleet are now running on weekdays, with one train also operating at weekends.
They are replacing the struggling carriages that have served the Metro network since it opened in 1980 and have become increasingly failure-prone, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The new trains have new features including phone charging points, climate control, and a sliding step at every door.
Metro operator Nexus says it still expects to have half of the new fleet in service by the end of 2025 and all of the new trains by the end of 2026.
Major projects director Paul Welford said it was the ""biggest project"" in the Metro's history.
""Stadler will be delivering around 16 more new trains from their factory in Switzerland this calendar year,"" he said.
""They have built more than two-thirds of the 46 new trains that we have on order.""

Plans unveiled for town centre redesign,Horsham District Council says it wants to add new cycle lanes and public spaces to the town centre.,11 Apr 2025,Sussex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglxxjj9dr1o,"Plans have been unveiled for a ""major redesign"" of Horsham town centre which would add new cycle lanes and infrastructure.
Horsham District Council says it is considering plans to improve the town centre by introducing new cycle lanes, street furniture and a new green space in the area.
Works in Bishopric and Worthing Road in the town would begin this Autumn, subject to a consultation with residents.
Barbara Childs, the council's director of place, said she was excited about the improvements which ""aim to promote a sustainable environment, better access and a thriving economy for Horsham"".
Plans under consideration include two new cycle lanes, in Carfax and through Worthing Road.
A new public space in Bishopric would also be designed to be ""inviting and inclusive to meet the needs of local communities and businesses"".
The project will also include more planters and trees to improve climate resilience as well as the look of the area.
A consultation on the plans has been opened and will run online until 30 April alongside two in-person events.
Ms Childs added: ""I am excited about the proposed improvements and urge everyone to share their views with us to ensure they meet everyone's needs and new ideas can be taken on board.
""This is a unique opportunity to shape the future of our much-loved town centre.""

Hull and East Yorkshire mayoral election: Kerry Harrison,Kerry Harrison is standing for the Green Party in the Hull and East Yorkshire mayoral election.,7 Apr 2025,Hull & East Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78e8zwxzw7o,"On 1 May voters in Hull and East Yorkshire will decide the first elected mayor of the new combined authority. You can find more information about the election and the candidates here.
She is the Green party candidate and lives with her two sons who attend local schools.
""I live in the community, not in an ivory tower,"" Kerry said. ""As such I am acutely aware of the issues that the people of Hull and East Yorkshire encounter in the current climate.
""I strongly feel that there is a need for community building to support and empower the people of Hull and East Yorkshire that would benefit our generation and those to come.""
""We can use the resources that we already have by refurbishing old and abandoned housing, as well as creating new housing,"" she said. ""This would create not only safe, warm homes for people, but the opportunity for good quality jobs in the process.""
""As we invest more in green transport and housing, we will see the increase of green job opportunities which are vital in our area.""
""We need to prioritise our environment. Not just the climate but the spaces we live in to improve a sense of community,"" she says.
""We can do this through the development of green spaces, including community gardens and orchards. Being in nature has been proven to support our wellbeing and a reconnection with our natural world is a positive move towards ownership of our spaces and community empowerment.""
""We need to see investment in public transport to ensure that it is affordable and accessible for all in Hull and East Yorkshire,"" she said.
""We can do this by retaining the flat rate £2 bus fare and by bringing bus ownership back into public ownership. In doing this profits would be directed back into the service, not in to shareholder pockets.
""Safe walking and cycling routes would also help to create more freedom for people in our communities to move around and enjoy our area.""
""It's important to invest in public infrastructure, however, we also need to ensure that our community feels safe and secure financially.
""I would push for a pilot test for universal basic income and a four-day working week in our communities to help support those who are most vulnerable.
""We need to ask the very richest in society to pay a little but more. We need to tax the super-rich fairly to help fund our overstretched public services."""
CCTV captures moment of explosion in central Athens,"There have been no reported injuries, as Greece's transport minister condemns the ""criminal"" attack.",12 Apr 2025,Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r51d2r8peo,"CCTV footage shows the dramatic moment a bomb exploded in central Athens, damaging the offices of Greek railway company Hellenic Train.
A backpack containing the explosive was reportedly left outside the office block late on Friday. Police said anonymous calls were made to Greek media outlets warning of the attack. No fatalities or injuries have been reported.
Though the cause of the explosion is not yet known, it comes amid widespread anger over a railway disaster that left 57 dead in 2023.
Greece's Transport Minister Christos Dimas condemned the explosion as a ""criminal act"" that had ""endangered the lives of people"".
Local news outlets Efsyn, a Greek daily newspaper, and website Zougla - both of which received a call - said the explosive device had apparently been placed in a padlocked backpack on a scooter without licence plates.
A police bomb disposal squad arrived too late to safely detonate the device before it exploded, they said.
Dimas said in a statement: ""This is a criminal act, which endangered the lives of people, employees and passers-by, in a central point of Athens and during peak traffic hour.""
He added: ""Nothing justifies terrorism, no act of violence brings justice. The authorities and the judiciary now have the floor.""
The explosion occurred close to one of the Greek capital's busiest highways, Leoforos Andrea Siggrou.
Hellenic Train confirmed no employees or passing citizens were injured and that the blast caused ""limited material damage"".
It said: ""Our company unequivocally condemns all forms of violence and tensions that fuel a climate of toxicity that undermines all progress.""
In February 2023, a freight train and a passenger train carrying 350 people travelling in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. Most of the people killed were young students, while dozens were injured.
Multiple protests have been held in Greece since, including earlier this year to mark the crash's second anniversary.
Those demonstrations descended into violence, with hooded protesters seen throwing rocks and petrol bombs at police. Officers responded with tear gas and water cannons.
An inquiry concluded in February that the train crash was caused by human error, poor maintenance and inadequate staffing.
A date for a trial is yet to be announced."
Student buildings bulldozed in housing estate plan,Plans are approved for up to 261 homes on a former student accomodation site in Huddersfield.,13 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g432wvpg7o,"A former student accomodation block in Huddersfield will be demolished to make way for up to 261 homes despite concerns about the removal of dozens of trees.
Developers Ubrique Investments Ltd have been given outline planning permission to build a housing estate on the site of Storthes Hall, which once housed 1,300 students.
Almost 60 complaints were received about the plans with one resident describing the loss of trees as a ""mass destruction of the natural world"".
However, Kirklees Council officers said public benefits, such as an increase in housing, highway improvements and boosting the economy, outweighed the negatives.
The planning permission allows for the demolition of the student accommodation as well as a vacant bar and restaurant.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said listed assets including The Lodge Cottage and gate piers would remain, along with a reception building.
Concerns had been raised aroud issues including the impact on roads and wildlife and a lack of services such as doctors and schools.
Fears about the loss of trees were also highlighted at a the planning meeting on Thursday.
Resident Heather Peacock told councillors she was ""absolutely staggered"" by the number of trees that would be removed, with the figure standing at 100, according to a council report.
She said: ""I've never seen a development of such mass destruction to the natural world as this.
""In all the years I've been doing tree activism, climate emergency activism, I've never seen anything like it.""
Councillor John Taylor, who spoke in support of the plans, said students had moved out of the accommodation so the site needed to be utilised.
He added: ""We're seeing significant vandalism occurring there because effectively what you've got is a load of student flats that are empty and all it's going to do is attract more vandalism and more anti-social behaviour in a quiet part of Kirkburton.""
Because the permission granted was outline - only considering the principle of residential development - it means any further details will need to be brought forward and agreed by the council before homes are built.

Inspector absence puts bee population 'under threat',NI's last full-time bee inspector retired in 2024 and the part-time inspector died shortly after.,18 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2vrpl04xgo,"Northern Ireland's honey bees are ""under threat"" due to the absence of a bee inspectorate since last year, according to the chair of Ulster Beekeepers Association (UBKA).
The bee inspector is responsible for supporting bee health and addresses diseases such as American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB) which affect honey bees.
Valentine Hodges described the situation as ""critical"", adding that she is angry and disappointed that the post is vacant.
The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) said it ""is responding to recent reductions in inspectorate staff available for bee inspections and recruitment competitions are under way"".
The last full-time bee inspector retired at the end of October 2024 and the part-time inspector role has been vacant since December 2024.
Where AFB and EFB occur, the disease control of infected colonies is the responsibility of DAERA and its inspectors.
Although beekeepers must report diseases within their own colonies, bee inspectors confirm such notifiable diseases, contain outbreaks, inspect neighbouring hives, and advise on destroying affected colonies.
Habitat loss, climate change, including the effects of extreme weather, and parasites and diseases are all factors that affect honey bees.
American foulbrood, a bacteria that infects young bee larvae, is less common than European foulbrood but is considered especially deadly for a bee colony - it can spread through a hive leading to the entire colony's death.
Its spores can also live for decades making monitoring and managing bee colonies critical.
Mrs Hodges, a beekeeper in County Down who has about 80-100 hives, said bee inspectors ""play a very important part in our normal beekeeping"".
""We now are at a critical stage where, through lack of recruitment and replacement, we have no bee inspectors,"" Mrs Hodges stated.
""The diseases themselves are not a threat to the public, they are a threat to our bees.""
However, she said if diseases spread, it could have a knock-on effect for food supply and pollination services due to honey bees being a key pollinator.
AFB and EFB do not affect the quality of the honey that the bees produce.
Mrs Hodges said Daera's recruitment process is ""not good enough"".
""It is good for the future, but we have a crisis right now,"" she added.
Gareth Gillan, a beekeeper for more than 20 years and treasurer at Mid Antrim Beekeepers Association, said he is ""really concerned"".
""Whenever we do get inspectors back, is there going to be loads of cases of foulbrood?
""American foulbrood especially is spore forming, so those spores can live up to 50 years, 60 maybe, max, so that will be in the environment for that length of time,"" he said.
""It's not something that will go away after a couple of years, they will still be present in the environment for a long time to come.""
Mr Gillan said that about 15 years ago one of his hives had a confirmed case of AFB and he had to destroy the rest of the colony.
""I was a bit remorseful because I had only started my beekeeping career and this had happened. But it was best practice"".
For the next two years his hives were checked regularly by the bee inspector for further signs of disease.
In a statement, the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs spokesperson Carla Lockhart said: ""The beekeeping community has been raising alarm bells for months, and I've personally challenged the minister on this issue several times.""
""Beekeepers deserve better. Our farming sector deserves better. And our environment demands better,"" she said.
""I will continue pressing the minister until we see meaningful action, proper accountability, and a full restoration of inspection services.""
In a statement, Daera said it recently met the UBKA, adding that it is ""committed to ensuring that its statutory obligations are fulfilled, which in the case of bee health is primarily to respond to confirmed findings of a notifiable pest or disease in honeybees"".
""In addition, the department provides funding to the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) to provide research and free testing for bee disease, available to support all beekeepers to maintain bee health in Northern Ireland,"" Daera said."
No legal requirement to update heating in new bill,A previous version of the bill required new homeowners to replace their heating systems by 2045.,3 Apr 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrgd85yxmxo,"The Scottish government has announced a revised plan to decarbonise Scotland's heating systems by 2045.
Acting Net Zero Secretary Gillian Martin scrapped the previous plan last month, saying it would ""make people poorer"".
The revised Heat in Buildings Bill sets targets for decarbonisation but it stops short of legally requiring homeowners and businesses to replace their heating systems by 2045, as outlined in the previous version.
Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie, who drafted the previous bill, warned that the government was ""watering down"" the legislation and and ""stripping away almost all of its serious policy measures"".
Acting Climate Action Minister Alasdair Allan said the Scottish government would bring forward the revised bill for consideration by the Scottish Parliament later in 2025.
The production of heat accounts for more than half of Scotland's energy demands and is the largest contributor to the country's carbon emissions.
MSPs have already passed legislation committing the country to achieving net-zero emissions by 2045.
Proposals drawn up while the Scottish Greens were still in the government would have required property owners to switch from ""polluting"" heating systems, such as gas boilers, to more environmentally-friendly alternatives like heat pumps.
Mr Allan said the 2045 target sends a ""strong signal to homeowners, landlords and other building owners on the need to prepare for change"".
However, he accepted the upfront costs customers have to pay for ""clean heating systems remain higher than those for fossil fuel systems"".
He told MSPs at Holyrood that the new approach ""moves away from penalising individuals and instead commits to collective action"".
Mr Allan added: ""Instead of placing prohibitions on every homeowner, we will establish targets for government to reach.""
Harvie - who recently announced plans to step down as co-leader of the Scottish Greens - said his original legislation was being ""gutted"" and warned that the government's new approach was ""very clearly going to fail"".
He added: ""If there is one thing that we have learned about climate policy in recent years, it is that setting targets without decisive action to meet them is meaningless.""
He also claimed that not including a ""property purchase trigger"" - which would have required people buying a home to commit to changing the heating system to a greener alternative within a fixed time period - would mean a ""dramatically slower uptake of clean heating in Scotland"".
Labour also raised concerns, with Paul O'Kane highlighting how the Scottish government had abandoned its target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2030.
He said: ""Given the government has failed to deliver on their climate change targets, and literally broke their own legislation on it, how can the people and industries of Scotland have faith that they will deliver and meet heat in building targets?""
Conservative housing spokesperson Meghan Gallacher said the ""rehashed bill still provides no clarity on the costs to the public"".
She said: ""Rather than continually setting net-zero targets that they fail to meet, the SNP must finally outline a fair and affordable transition for hard-pressed, over-taxed Scots.""
Charities have warned that the legislation ""risks being a toothless bill"".
Io Hadjicosta, from WWF Scotland, said Scots were seeing ""yet more targets without meaningful measures to provide certainty to industry or to reduce emissions"".
Lewis Ryder-Jones, from Oxfam Scotland, said: ""Weakening Scotland's clean-heat plans risks leaving people to struggle with sky-high bills and cold, draughty homes while pouring cold water on the transition to a greener Scotland that works for everyone."""

Will this be the 'anyone but the big parties' local election?,"""Slivers"" of votes are set to decide the local elections - with the big parties likely to suffer.",26 Apr 2025,BBC InDepth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77nm4jprl8o,"""A sliver here and a sliver there"" – in a few days millions of voters will be taking part in what are, frankly, a pretty weird set of elections.
Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons.
The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven't encountered thus far - a track record to defend.
The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour's wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10.
Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to ""have to be unpopular"" – a curious ambition for a politician!
But more candid insiders admit the government ""looked very unsure"" at the start. ""They didn't come in with a big project,"" one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers' freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance.
Labour loyalists and spin doctors will emphasise what is true – the elections being fought at council level are ""us fighting in the shires"", as one of them said.
A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won't be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, ""they're just not our heartlands, so we just haven't got our normal base"".
But Labour could also lose mayors and there's no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on.
After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt.
The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it's going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, ""absolutely, mercilessly hammered"" back in July.
The leadership says ""nowhere is safe"".  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control.
The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that ""we might not yet actually have hit the bottom"", in the words of another veteran.
Leader Kemi Badenoch's backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years.
The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won't usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a Conservative who'd happily bet their mortgage she'll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election.
That's in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, ""she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it's not her versus Starmer,  it's her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey"".
This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. They see success in these elections as ""two or three more steps up the staircase"" towards power, says a senior figure.
The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and ""putting Farage out to draw a crowd"", according to a minister.
Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren't banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats.
But anything less than big wins will undermine their exuberant claim that it's credible to see Farage in No 10 one day – and possibly, for that matter, give pollsters red faces again.

Reform might be the loudest group, but they're not the only one making life hard for the big boys. The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week – whether it's Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West.
Leader Sir Ed Davey's been back in his happy place – carrying out ever more ridiculous stunts on the campaign trail, meeting hedgehogs, and even waving around packets of British pork chops on TikTok this time, (I'm not making that up).
After July last year, the Lib Dems have a taste for making the Tories miserable, not just for the sake of it, but in the hope of taking out another chunk of their party's traditional infrastructure, in the shape of their county councillors.
And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump.
Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England.
In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year.
This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats.
The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force.
Any election is also a test of our political parties' campaign machines – the questions different for each this time round.
For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn't seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn't surprise.
For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the ""tumbleweed Tories"", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground.
Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country.
The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online.
In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that ""sliver here and sliver there"".
These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's ""fragmentation"" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead.
The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority.
In that case, they go into what's known as ""no overall control"", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way.
It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground?
Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement.
Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, ""the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend"".
Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the ""ABC election – Anyone But the Conservatives"", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the ""ABB election – Anyone But the Big parties"".

"'No hormones please, we're British beef farmers'",Different rules on farming standards on either side of the Atlantic could make a trade deal tricky,17 Apr 2025,Gloucestershire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31qqlq29vo,"As talk of a trade deal between America and the UK hots up, farmers on this side of the Atlantic have warned ministers not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in particular cannot be accepted.
US Vice President JD Vance has said there is a ""good chance"" of reaching a trade deal with Britain.
But the man who speaks for Britain's livestock farmers insisted any imported US beef must pass the same tests as UK meat.
David Barton, Livestock Chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), said: ""There is no way we would accept anything that is not produced to our standards"".
The last time the two countries tried to agree a deal, negotiations faltered on arguments over food standards.
So why is something as simple as beef so difficult?
David Barton farms several hundred beef cattle on the Cotwolds, north of the ancient Roman city of Cirencester.
When I met him, he was checking on young calves.
""Some of these are just a week old,"" he smiled.
They will be raised almost entirely on Gloucestershire's green grass and their mother's milk. Mr Barton cuts his own sileage, and buys local cereal feeds for the winter.
He has met American beef farmers, and tells me he has ""no issues"" with the way they farm.
""They produce beef in a much much harsher environment than we do,"" he explained.
""Our temperate climate, our lush grass - the British Isles are just designed for beef. We don't have to add much.""
Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in Britain and the EU in the 1980s.
""In the US that's what they do, and that's fine,"" said Mr Barton.
""We don't do it here, and that's part of our standards.""
He admits that adding growth hormones would make cows put on muscle mass, and so make their beef cheaper, but as a country Britain had ""decided we weren't going to do that"".
Mr Barton chairs the NFU's livestock group, where he discusses many issues with other beef and lamb farmers.
And he is quite clear that if a new trade deal allowed more US beef into Britain, hormones should be unacceptable.
""What you cannot do is you cannot let imports come in to a lower standard, because you completely destroy what you've built over many years.""
For now, British ministers insist the country's food and farming rules are ""red lines"" they will not cross.
Jonathan Reynolds MP, Business and Trade Secretary said: ""That's a really important area that we wouldn't be able to negotiate on, and the US understands that.""
But could that change, in a close trade negotiation?
President Trump has already championed the ""great products"" of American farmers and ranchers.
It's known that he wants to see them enjoyed - and sold - across the world. And when family budgets are tight, would at least some British supermarkets be keen to offer cheaper American beef or chicken?
For now, industry experts say no.
Professor David Wain teaches animal welfare at Cirencester's Royal Agricultural University. He told me the ""main drivers"" in the UK meat industry are retailers, demanding higher standards.
He said: ""I'm quite sure that our importation requirements would not permit chlorine washing of chicken.
""And there is no sign at all that the UK would permit hormone-treated beef.""

NI and Irish leaders react to 'profound sadness' of Pope's death,Leaders across the island pay tribute and express condolences following the death of Pope Francis.,21 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74nwewyw8vo,"Leaders from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have joined the outpouring of tributes to Pope Francis.
Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O'Neill said that Catholics ""right across the world, including here in Ireland, will feel his loss deeply"".
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micháel Martin said the passing of Pope Francis comes with ""a profound sadness"".
Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at his residence in the Vatican's Casa Santa Marta just a day after he appeared in St Peter's Square to wish ""happy Easter"" to thousands of worshippers.
O'Neill recalled Pope Francis' visit to Ireland in 2018 where ""he spoke passionately in support of the peace process"".
""He also marked the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, giving thanks for the peace it delivered in Ireland,"" she added.
She said he ""showed compassion on LGBT issues and condemned right-wing extremists, and he was ahead of many world leaders in speaking out against the Israeli war in Gaza"".
""His efforts to reach out and acknowledge past wrongs should also be recognised.""
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said that while many in the unionist community hold different theological views, it was important to recognise ""the profound respect and admiration"" that many held for ""the humble caretaker who entered the priesthood and died as the head of the Roman Catholic Church"".
""At this moment, we acknowledge their sorrow and offer our sincere condolences,"" he added.
Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said that Pope Francis was ""held in high regard and admiration by so many"" and that his loss ""will be felt deeply"".
Northern Ireland secretary Hilary Benn described Pope Francis as ""a tireless campaigner for the poor and the oppressed"".
He added that the death of the Pope was ""a moment of great sadness"" not only for Catholics but also ""those of other faiths and no faith at all"".
""Wherever there was conflict he sought peace, as he showed in his interest in Northern Ireland and his support for the Good Friday Agreement,"" he added.
Micháel Martin said Pope Francis' ""long and distinguished papacy was marked by his unwavering commitment to the principles of compassion, peace, and human dignity"".
""He spoke out for the poor, the marginalised, and the oppressed.
""His solidarity with refugees, his calls for climate action, and his insistence on global peace and equality set him apart as a champion of justice in the modern world.""
He added that the Pope holds a ""special place in the hearts of Irish people"".
""During his visit to Ireland in August 2018 for the World Meeting of Families, he was welcomed with warmth and enthusiasm that spoke volumes about the respect and affection in which he was held by Irish people.""
Martin also made reference to Pope Francis' ""expression of pain and shame about historic child abuse in the Catholic Church and his outrage about the failure of Church authorities to adequately address these appalling crimes"".
""Pope Francis' legacy is his message of peace, reconciliation, and solidarity that lives in the hearts of those he inspired,"" he added.
Ireland's president Michael D Higgins said Pope Francis' voice ""constituted a consistent invocation of a shared humanity"" on the ""vital issues of our time"".
""There was a warmth to Pope Francis and an abolition of any distance between himself and those with whom he was engaged,"" he added.
Sinn Féin president, and leader of the opposition in Ireland, Mary Lou McDonald said: ""I am deeply saddened to hear that Pope Francis has died.
""For those of us who are Catholics this is a moment of huge loss.""
Ireland's Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Harris said that ""Pope Francis' commitment to justice, peace, and human dignity touched millions"".
""Through his advocacy for the poor, his calls for interfaith dialogue, and his focus on environmental issues, he was a beacon of hope and a voice for the voiceless.""
He said that Pope Francis' influence ""transcended the Vatican, offering moral leadership during times of uncertainty"".
""His teachings on poverty, migration, and refugees remain relevant as we confront global inequality and division,"" he added.
In 2013, Francis became the first Pope from the Americas or the southern hemisphere.
He was already in his seventies when he replaced Benedict XVI.
His predecessor was the first Pope to retire voluntarily in almost 600 years.
Francis will be the first Pope in more than a century to be buried outside the Vatican.
He will be laid to rest in the Basilica of St Mary Major, one of four major papal basilicas in Rome.
The new Pope will be chosen by the Catholic Church's most senior officials, known as the College of Cardinals.
All men, they are appointed directly by the Pope, and are usually ordained bishops.
There are currently 252 Catholic cardinals, 135 of whom are eligible to vote for the new Pope.
Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Edwin Poots said he would be coordinating arrangements to mark the Pope's death in the assembly.
""As Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, I express my condolences to the many people in our community who are in mourning today,"" he said.
""I will be engaging with the party whips to make appropriate arrangements for the assembly to mark the passing of Pope Francis,"" he said.
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it was a sad day not just for Catholics but for ""everyone who wishes to be in a shared and pluralist society"".
""Despite religious differences across the world, Pope Francis straddled barriers in favour of social justice.
""The world has lost an advocate for peace, freedom and democracy with his passing,"" she added.
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Claire Hanna said Pope Francis ""was a leader of humanity and authenticity"".
""Throughout his ministry, he championed the poor and marginalised, including refugees.
""He led on behalf of future generations too, through his focus on environmental leadership and what he called 'care for our common home',"" she added.
Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Mike Nesbitt said Pope Francis was a ""remarkable leader"".
A spokesperson for the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) said the party ""recognises that the death of the Pope is something which will be mourned by Roman Catholics across the world, including in Northern Ireland""."
Swinney to announce government policy plans early,"The first minister will deliver the legislative agenda next month, a year ahead of Holyrood elections.",14 Apr 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x8llxy5yo,"First Minister John Swinney is bringing forward an annual announcement on his policy and legislative goals.
The SNP leader said moving the programme for government to 6 May would ""enable a full year to delivery"" before the Holyrood elections in spring 2026.
The agenda is ordinarily published after summer recess, with last year's announcement made in September.
Opposition MSPs accused the Scottish government of economic incompetence.
Speaking at Bute House, Swinney said the programme for government would take action ahead of the ""undoubted economic challenges"" facing the country.
He cited Brexit, the pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and US trade tariffs as sources of financial turmoil and said there was a risk of recession.
The first minister said he wanted his programme for government to offer ""meaningful solutions"" to people's problems.
He said the government would seek to address ""that underlying feeling of anxiety that affects so many people at this time"".
Swinney said the legislative programme would help tackle child poverty, bring down NHS waiting lists and make it easier to get a GP appointment.
Swinney also said the Grangemouth oil refinery should be nationalised by the UK govenrment if similar action is taken at British Steel.
Labour ministers have said the situation at Grangemouth is different to the steelmaking plant at Scunthorpe, after emergency legislation was passed at the weekend to keep the site open.
Swinney said he had spoken to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other devolved leaders on Friday about US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
The SNP leader said while the call had been constructive, the UK government should do ""much more to protect Scotland's economic interests"".
He also called for the UK government to remove the ""economic straitjacket"" of its self-imposed fiscal rules, forge closer ties with the EU and reverse an increase in employers' national insurance contributions.
He added: ""If British Steel is to be nationalised to protect it, then so too should Grangemouth.""
Swinney went on to say the ""time is right"" for independence, arguing it would give ministers the economic powers to help it cope better with global financial shocks.
Scottish Conservative finance spokesperson Craig Hoy said: ""Tearing Scotland out of the UK would be an act of economic self-harm at any time, but doing so now, when the world economy is facing extreme pressure, would be utterly reckless.""
Scottish Labour finance spokesperson Michael Marra criticised the first minister's call for the chancellor Rachel Reeves to change her fiscal rules, accusing the SNP administration of financial incompetence.
He added: ""An end to any kind of fiscal rule promises economic chaos and vast interest rate rises hitting growth and hammering mortgage rates.""
The Scottish Greens called for climate action to be key to the next programme for government.
Party co-leader Lorna Slater said: ""With bills soaring and stretching households and families to their limits, it is vital that we move away from fossil fuels and support people in making green choices.""
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the SNP had been ""promising jam tomorrow"" for 18 years and, on Grangemouth, said the government was ""more interested in chasing headlines"" than in building a proper industrial strategy.
The Grangemouth refinery is the UK's oldest, dating back to 1924.
It is being closed down by owner Petroineos - a joint venture between Ineos and PetroChina - with the loss of 400 of the 2,000 jobs which are based at the huge industrial complex.
Scotland Office minister Kirsty McNeill said the UK government was providing more than £200m to protect the future of Grangemouth, saying the circumstances there cannot be compared to the steel industry.
Without emergency action for British Steel, she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, there was a risk of the Scunthorpe blast furnaces going out forever.
The Labour minister claimed the previous Conservative UK administration and the Scottish government had ""no industrial strategy to speak of"".
She added: ""In the end, they're having a conversation about Grangemouth today because they're manufacturing a grievance.
""We, by contrast, have taken serious action from the minute we got in (office) in July."""
Donald Trump is looming over Australia's election,Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in Australia's poll - but the US president has changed that.,2 May 2025,BBC InDepth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w80ndlp2yo,"Listen to Katy read this article
In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.
People here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.
In recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.
""Tariffs are great,"" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. ""We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic … Trump's the best thing America ever had.''
Other spectators are more nuanced.
""It's going nuts,"" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. ""I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.""
Australia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency – and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.
But Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world.
Trump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' – a value that embodies friendship and loyalty – and that extends to politics too.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not ""the act of a friend,"" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.
All of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?
In the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.
""It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,"" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. ""The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.""
The US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China – and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.
The rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.
It's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.
Back in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.
""What does that mean?"" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. ""We'll be discussing that … we've had a very good relationship with Australia.""
Australia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.
A blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.
""We don't have anywhere else to turn,"" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. ""We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.""
While only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.
""This isn't a time to end alliances,"" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. ""That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.""
And, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.
""We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,"" he says. ""Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.""
A poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.
And a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.
Big questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.
Dutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.
""He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,"" says Remeikis. ""He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.""
Dutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president ""a deal-maker … a big thinker.""
And he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.
Albanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.
That may turn out to be in his favour.
Indeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.
For Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.
""What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,"" he says.
""The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. ""
But whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.
""We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,"" says Andrews. ""I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism – so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.""
Back at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos – the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground.
Flying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.

They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead.
The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.
The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).
The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison.
The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as ""cathedrals to science"".
Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.
""We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,"" he says.
When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter – from which stars, planets and everything around us are made – and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.
Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we – as matter – are.
Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won – and we exist – lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.
They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.
This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.
The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.
Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be ""transformative"" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.
""It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,"" she said.
Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K.
The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.
""We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,"" he says.
Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, ""I would like to get there first!""

But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.
""There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently.""
The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery – for now.

St Ives Bay carbon capture plans scrapped,"Bosses said it had been judged as ""commercially unviable"" in Cornwall and it would not be pursued.",10 Apr 2025,Cornwall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5ww14zv1vo,"Controversial carbon capture plans in west Cornwall has been scrapped, it has been confirmed.
The Planetary Technologies team wanted to release magnesium hydroxide into St Ives Bay and monitor how the chemical affected ocean acidity and carbon dioxide levels.
However, some people opposed the idea and the impact on wildlife and the environment.
On Wednesday, the company said the ""scale-up of operations in Cornwall has been assessed as commercially unviable and we will not be pursuing a wider programme in the region"".
On the company's website it said: ""We worked with local utility South West Water and proposed the addition of a diluted form of the mineral magnesium hydroxide to the existing water flow at the water treatment plant in Hayle.
The company said adding the alkaline compound to the sea would help counter ocean acidity caused by climate change.
It said: ""Planetary has successfully completed its trial operations in Cornwall, UK, gathering valuable scientific data and insights.
""Although the trial demonstrated great potential, we have decided not to pursue a full programme in Cornwall due to commercial infeasibility.""
A spokesperson for Planetary Technologies added: ""Cornwall has played a meaningful role in our development, and we are deeply grateful to the local partners, community, and team members who have supported our mission.""
St Ives MP Andrew George said ""more research and robust studies"" needed to be carried out before chemicals were released into the environment.
He said: ""There remained uncertainty regarding the potential impact of pumping these chemicals on marine wildlife.
""The studies undertaken had not satisfied the Cornwall Carbon Scrutiny Group, in that the baseline data remained incomplete, the control and diffuser sites weren't comparable and the target study species were not present at the time of the trials.""
George said the decision was ""good common sense for Cornwall, seals, safe seas and local economy"".

Show reveals 'extraordinary' Ice Age art - council,"The Keighley Cliffe Castle display will contain objects from the British Museum, the council says.",12 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg721jl29pno,"Some of the rarest surviving examples of Ice Age art will go on display in Bradford as part of the 2025 City of Culture celebrations.
The Ice Age Art Now exhibition is expected to contain more than 75 objects borrowed from the British Museum as part of a partnership project with Bradford 2025 and Bradford District Museums & Galleries, the council said.
Sarah Ferriby, the authority's executive member for healthy people and places, said the collaboration ""emphasises our commitment to bringing world-class cultural experiences to people from across the Bradford district and beyond"".
The exhibition is due to open at the Cliffe Castle Museum in Keighley on 21 June, according to the council.
A spokesperson said the exhibition would present work by people living in Europe at the end of the last Ice Age, which was between 24,000 and 12,000 years ago.
The slow recovery from near extinction caused by climate change ""stimulated an extraordinary artistic renaissance"", they said.
""Then, as now, art contributed to people's psychological and emotional wellbeing.""
Shanaz Gulzar, Bradford 2025's creative director, said: ""Drawing is our first means of creative expression, and this exhibition proves people have been doing this for millennia.
""For these incredible objects to be on display here in the North, in the stunning Cliffe Castle, is a proud moment for the Bradford district.""
As part of the exhibition, visitors would be able to experience an immersive installation recreating the inside of a decorated cavem, the council said.
Nicholas Cullinan, director of the British Museum, said the exhibition would feature ""some of the rarest surviving examples of Ice Age art"" as well as ""some of the oldest known works of art from the UK"".
Among the exhibits would be an engraved drawing of a horse on bone, found at Creswell Crags, in Derbyshire, thought to be about 13,500 years old.
Other items in the collection would include a depiction of two reindeer which were believed to have been drawn on bone about 13,500 years ago, and an engraved bone pendant depicting a wolverine, thought to be between 12,000-13,000 years old.

How a burning river lit the US's green movement,"The Cuyahoga River was so polluted it regularly went up in flames. Images of one dramatic blaze in 1952 shaped the US's nascent environmental movement, long after the flames went out.",1 May 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250429-how-the-cuyahoga-river-fires-fuelled-the-us-green-movement,"Ohio's Cuyahoga River used to be so polluted it regularly went up in flames. Images of one dramatic blaze in 1952 shaped the US's nascent environmental movement, long after the flames went out.
The last time Ohio's Cuyahoga River notably caught fire was 22 June 1969. At midday, debris floating in an oil slick on the river ignited after sparks fell from a nearby passing train. While locals reported the flames reached five stories high, firefighters extinguished them in less than 30 minutes. Two railroad trestles sustained a total of $50,000 in damage ($428,500 in today's money, or £321,000). But the event was over before reporters could arrive.
""All we have photographically of the Cuyahoga fire in '69 is pictures of firemen mopping up, spraying the trestle, and then Carl Stokes, the mayor, on the tracks the next morning talking to the press about it,"" says David Stradling, professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, US. Earlier images of fires on the same river, such as that pictured above in 1952, nevertheless began to be circulated when the 1969 blaze occurred.
And yet, this short-lived fire on the Cuyahoga River became a powerful moment in the growing environmental activism movement in the United States. The images of the river's previous fires ignited national conversations on pollution and social justice, just as the US's nascent environmental movement was gathering pace.
The history of the river's dire pollution stretches back long before its final blaze. By the late 1800s, Cleveland and the Cuyahoga had become a hub for the Industrial Revolution. Stradling says it started with steel mills towards the head of navigation (the farthest point upstream on a river where boats can travel, often defined by a dam or other physical barrier). The river made it easy for boats to transport ore. ""Once the steel industry became established in Cleveland, all these other ancillary industries were good to have nearby,"" he says.
With all of this steel production came excess chemicals and grease, says Stradling, and since there were virtually no environmental regulations at the time, a lot of it ended up in the river, along with raw sewage.
""We didn't treat our wastewater, so anything that you flushed down the toilet was piped straight into the river,"" says Adam Schellhammer, Mid-Atlantic regional director of the non-profit, American Rivers. Then, in the early 1900s amid World War One, industrialisation ramped up and the river pollution got worse. ""With that uptick in manufacturing, these rivers were bearing the brunt of all that, and there were no restrictions on what went in,"" says Schellhammer.
By the 1930s, the Cuyahoga had essentially become an open sewer, infamous for its foul smell and telltale sheen of oil slick. Unsurprisingly, the fauna that typically reside in and around the river steered clear, or died. ""The Cuyahoga was a completely dead river for decades,"" says Stradling. ""There were no fish, no water fowl."" Those who lived nearby cautioned that if you fell in, you had to be rushed to the hospital.
And, occasionally, the massively polluted river burned.
The first fire on the river was in 1868, and there were at least 12 subsequent fires, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The biggest ones occurred in 1936, 1941, 1952 and 1969.
Local protests and dogged advocacy by Mayor Carl B. Stokes had already led to a $100m bond for river cleanup passing in 1968 (equivalent to more than $900m today). When the river burned again in 1969, Stokes acted quickly.
""It was a right place, right time situation,"" says Anne Vogel, former director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and current EPA region 5 administrator. ""Cleveland was also a place, at the time, where environmental and social situations intersected.""
Stokes was the first black mayor of a major city in the US, and he was acutely aware of how racial inequality in the industrialised parts of Cleveland was reflected in the water pollution issue since poorer, predominantly black communities lived in those areas.
""He's a black man in a majority white city surrounded by almost entirely white suburbs,"" says Stradling. ""So he doesn't have a whole lot of political allies, but he could have allies in the press who can get things before the people and talk about the Cuyahoga as a regional problem, not just Cleveland's problem.""
Connecting the social and environmental challenges of the area marks him out as forward-thinking in his work on what came to be called environmental justice, says Stradling. ""There's no point in working on public health if you're not going to solve water and air pollution problems.""
To drive the point home, Stokes gave a much-photographed pollution tour to reporters the day after the 1969 river fire. The tour went beyond Cleveland's confines to showcase the surrounding area's sewer system. He was making it abundantly clear that in order to clean up the Cuyahoga, the city would need help from its neighbours and the federal government. Convincing the neighbouring suburbs was the real challenge, says Stradling, since they weren't as aware of the pollution accumulating downstream.
On that tour was Betty Klaric, one of the US's earliest specialist environmental reporters, writing for the Cleveland Press, who dedicated much of her career to reporting on the health of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie, which the river feeds. Her reporting of the 1969 fire was resurfaced several times by more prominent, national publications.
Stradling recalls a compelling photo of Stokes and reporters standing on a railroad bridge after the fire, its metal distorted from the heat. In the image, Stokes is talking to Klaric. ""There are a whole bunch of other press around, including the television [crews] with their cameras, but I just love that that photograph is of him talking to Betty, because I think he knew that she was the most important person besides him on that bridge,"" he says.
The story reported by Klaric and others was soon picked up nationally. A 1969 Time magazine spread on water pollution reproduced images of the earlier blaze on the river in 1952 – a menacing frontline of flames and black, billowing smoke engulfing a tug boat as it fights to contain a raging fire on the oil-slicked water (the same 1952 image is reproduced at the start of this article). Long, powerful streams of water from firefighters on a nearby bridge cascade over the river, offering backup.
""It was late summer when Time magazine ran a story about water pollution in the United States,"" says Stradling, who co-wrote Where the River Burned, a history of the infamously polluted Cuyahoga, with his brother Richard Stradling. ""[The article] mentioned lots of places, but one that was mentioned most frequently was the Cuyahoga River and how it had become a fire hazard."" The book notes that Time did not clarify that the photos of the fire had been taken 17 years prior, and it remains unclear whether the publication ""mistakenly used the older photo or did so deliberately, perhaps thinking the more dramatic scene would grab readers' attention"". (Time magazine was contacted for clarity on the matter, but did not respond by the time this article was published.)
The photo of the 1952 fire came to symbolise how waterway pollution in the US had grown out of control, and it fed the flames of public outcry over environmental crises. ""It was a culmination of events, and the Cuyahoga [fire] was so visible that the calls for unified approaches to environmental protection could not be ignored any longer,"" says Schellhammer.
While the first Earth Day, on 22 April 1970, is considered the official start of the environmental movement in the US, the idea had been planted years earlier in 1962 with the release of Rachel Carson's book on the misuse of pesticides, Silent Spring. Eight years later, when 20 million people marched to advocate for nationwide environmental protections, US President Richard Nixon responded by establishing the EPA.
The Cuyahoga River's ongoing recovery
1952: Cuyahoga River's most damaging fire
1969: Cuyahoga River's last major fire
1970: EPA established
1972: Clean Water Act
1986: River otters reintroduced to several Ohio rivers, including the Cuyahoga
1987: Cuyahoga River designated Area of Concern (AOC) under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement
2006: Bald eagles return to the Cuyahoga area
2009: Great Lakes Restoration Initiative begun by EPA
2019: Conditions improve enough to lift restrictions on consuming Cuyahoga fish
2020: Brecksville Dam removed
2022: First natural trumpeter swan nest seen on the Cuyahoga
Two years after that, the Clean Water Act followed, which laid the groundwork for the restoration of the Cuyahoga. While not a direct cause and effect, the river fires are often cited as the prime example of water pollution at its worst in the US. The Cuyahoga River in particular, Schellhammer and others note, comes up time and again in this context. But Stradling adds that it was far from alone – as the Clean Water Act was being formulated, most members of Congress named a river in their jurisdiction that needed protection.
The Clean Water Act was actually an amendment to the existing Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which was passed in 1948, but the changes to the framework were so significant that it took on a new name.
""It put restrictions and parameters on what could be discharged,"" says Schellhammer. ""There was a set limit. Out of that [came] the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, also enacted in 1972, which framed what the entire area needed to do to clean up that river.""
Schellhammer says the Clean Water Act also acknowledged the need for wastewater treatment, which was virtually nonexistent before then. One new initiative that stemmed from the Act was connecting more of Cleveland's suburbs to an expanded sewage treatment plant, something Stokes had long argued for.
Then, the industries in the city began to clean up their act. ""Mills were already investing in some technologies that would dramatically decrease the amount of problematic effluent that went into the river, so that was really helpful,"" says Stradling. ""A lot of the most problematic industries [like oil refinement] simply closed and left in Cleveland.""
The new environmental restrictions played a significant part in shuttering the factories that supported the steel industry in Cleveland. ""It [was] this balance of regulatory framework, legal precedence and public outcry,"" Schellhammer saysof the industrial retreat.
Despite these developments, river cleanup on the Cuyahoga was gradual from the 1970s to the late 1980s. ""Water quality definitely improved; we wouldn't call it restored,"" says Schellhammer.
Some of the river's more significant restoration projects have been dam removals.Dams can be major impediments to the health of a river. They act as bottlenecks, limiting fish migration and increasing turbidity. In 2020, the Brecksville Dam, which was initially built to move water into the Ohio and Erie Canals, was taken out.
""It was pretty straightforward, but really awesome to show the benefit of that dam removal, because basically you're connecting the water and fish populations of Lake Erie to more upstream habitats,"" says Jennifer Grieser, director of natural resources for Cleveland Metroparks and Cuyahoga Area of Concern board member. ""We immediately started to see more species recruitment throughout the whole length of the river."" The next big project on the docket is the removal of the over 100-year-old Gorge Dam, considered the largest remaining impediment to the Cuyahoga River's health.
Grieser has overseen the removal of five impairments in the Cuyahoga's Area of Concern, including lifting restrictions on consuming fish from the river in 2019, and also the 50-year anniversary of the 1969 fire. She has four left, which she aims to complete within the next five years.
Yet people are already enjoying the cleaner state of the river. It's now considered a water trail, often dappled with kayakers, anglers and birdwatchers hoping to see blue herons or bald eagles, which returned to the area in 2006. The water is not considered pristine yet, but the ""crooked river"" has come a long way since it caught on fire over half a century ago.
""That's the amazing thing about this restoration story:i t happened in a lifetime,"" says Grieser.
Today, the US is at another pivotal point for the future health of its natural resources. In March, the Supreme Court weakened the reaches of the Clean Water Act, and the EPA cancelled over 400 grants.  ""Federal investments played a huge role in why [the Cuyahoga] River is functional again,"" says Schellhammer. The BBC contacted the EPA for comment but did not receive a response by the time this article was published.
The Cuyahoga may have represented how bad water pollution can get, but it became the ultimate comeback story.
""If we can come back from that, we can come back from anything,"" says Schellhammer.

Tropical parakeets ruffle feathers at Belfast park,It's estimated that about 15 parakeets have found a new home in north Belfast.,17 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1megxvnx3yo,"Amateur wildlife photographers have been flocking to a north Belfast park to spot a tropical new arrival.
Bedecked with emerald green feathers and a rose-red beak, the ring-neck parakeets have become the star attraction at the Waterworks Park.
Originally from the Himalayas, the Indian sub-continent, and parts of Africa, ring-necked parakeets are regularly spotted across the UK, with large populations in London and the south-east of England.
It's estimated that about 15 of these parrots have found a new home in the foothills of Cavehill.
The RSPB describes ring-necked parakeets, sometimes known as rose-ringed parakeets, as the UK's only naturalised parrot.
Dot Blakely, a bird expert who teaches bird-watching courses at Belfast Metropolitan College and Queen's University Belfast (QUB), said she brings students to the park to study the new residents.
""The parakeets are likely to have come over from London,"" she said. ""It's likely they moved across to the Republic of Ireland before moving up.""
""We're seeing more birds come across because of climate change, so many birds that we wouldn't have seen here before.
""People still think of it as a tropical bird but it has adapted.""
Ms Blakely told BBC News NI she thinks there are about 13 to15 parakeets living in the park, which indicates they are getting enough food to sustain a small colony and are likely to be breeding.
""There are lots of berries around the area, but lots of locals are leaving seed out for them,"" she added.
""Sometimes you'll see the birds right up at people's windows waiting to get fed.""
The brightly coloured birds have been attracting amateur photographers to the park.
Sharon Gregg, who took up photography after being diagnosed with a rare illness, told BBC News NI spending time in nature and watching the birds has had a positive effect on her wellbeing.
""When I first heard about the birds last month I would say: 'I'm away to look for the parrots.'
""People would think I was mad,"" she said.
Ms Gregg has photographed eight parakeets in one sitting before.
""I think the parakeets are such wonderful, special little birds and a lot of people don't even realise they are in the trees up above them,"" she said.
""They are really comical, cheeky wee things, and they are just a pleasure to watch.""
Michael Latham, from Bangor, is a keen twitcher, someone who goes to extraordinary lengths to see new bird species.
He has travelled to the area to see the birds a number of times over the past few years.
""The number has grown a bit over the last while,"" he said.
""There have been reports of breeding, but we think there is only one male.""
There has been a longstanding rumour that rock legend Jimi Hendrix is responsible for the parakeets coming to the UK.
The guitarist supposedly released a pair of the birds into the wild while living in Carnaby Street in London in the1960s.
There have also been rumours that the birds escaped across the country during the wrap party for the 1951 film The African Queen starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn.
However, a study published in the Journal of Zoology quashed these rumours.
It suggests that the birds establishment is more likely to be a consequence of repeated releases and introductions.
As for why they have moved from London across the UK, Ornithologist Professor Emily Shepherd said: ""Urban and suburban parks are their typical environment, so as soon as one area becomes too over-populated or competitive they seem to fly around in search of somewhere else which looks quite similar.
""They thrive in urban and suburban environments. They need people nearby who will either discard or deliberately leave out food for them,"" she said.
""They are big, tough birds, who are quite capable of bullying even jackdaws and crows out of the way of feeders, and in areas with plentiful food supplies they can survive sub-zero temperatures if they can put on enough winter fat.""
Parakeets are a non-native bird so they are classed as an invasive species.
Conor McKinney, the chair of Wild Belfast said: ""Parakeets may seem like a novel addition to our wildlife, but really they are pose a great risk to birds, bats, and to agriculture.
""Parakeets have the ability to out-compete native cavity nesting species, such as starlings, and have even been known to evict bats from their roosts,"" he said.
""Preventing the further dispersal of this species is possible, but it needs to happen soon.
""We call on Belfast City Council and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to return the birds to captivity and negate any potential risks of further spread.""
In a statement, the council said they are ""currently seeking advice from the relevant government department, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), in regard to the parakeets at Waterworks Park""."
Dozens die after torrential rain hammers Congolese capital,Kinshasa is prone to soil erosion and the president warned the climate crisis is making flooding worse.,7 Apr 2025,Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr782rgn8x4o,"Torrential rains and floods have killed at least 33 people in Kinshasa - the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo - according to officials.
""The republic will not abandon you,"" President Félix Tshisekedi promised victims on Monday, saying he had called a government crisis meeting.
Desperate residents are trying to flee the floodwaters by wading, swimming or paddling to safety in homemade canoes.
The city is home to 17 million people and sits on the Congo river, which is one of the biggest in the world and stretches across the country.
Flooding is common - the river recently reached its highest level in six decades.
Parts of the capital are prone to soil erosion and in recent years the Congolese president has warned that the climate crisis is making flooding worse.
Many homes in west Kinshasa were swept away following flooding overnight from Friday into Saturday.
About half of the city's 26 districts are affected in total, according to the capital's mayor, who says search and rescue teams have been sent out.
Worst affected are the city's outskirts as well as some of its poorest neighbourhoods.
""The water has reached 1.5m [4.9ft] high. We have just managed to save ourselves, the rest is trapped in our homes,"" Christophe Bola, who lives in the Ndanu area, told the AFP news agency.
Other local residents have told reporters they are angry with the authorities, accusing them of being too slow to react and not sending enough help.
The floods have also left people across much of Kinshasa struggling with water shortages, after water treatment pumps in the city were themselves inundated.
The city's busiest road, which connects the centre with the international airport, is impassable, as is some of the motorway that connects the capital to the country's main port, Matadi.
At least one tributary leading off the Congo river - the N'djili river - had burst its banks, trapping many residents there, said Deputy President Jacquemain Shabani in a statement on Sunday.
It is said to be one of the more polluted rivers which Congolese scientists say contains high levels of faecal matter and other waste.
Sewage maintenance is poor in many areas of Kinshasa, and there is little evidence of town planning.
Last year the government announced plans to tackle this long-standing problem.
Further heavy downpours are expected in Kinshasa in the coming weeks, as well as in the eastern city of Goma, which was seized by rebel forces earlier this year.
The national meteorological agency also warns of heavy rains elsewhere, especially in the north and north-east of the country.

Bites on gladiator bones prove combat with lion,Experts say the discovery provides the first physical evidence of gladiatorial combat with animals.,23 Apr 2025,North Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8v2063r19o,"Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.
The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.
Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.
Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first ""physical evidence"" of gladiators fighting big cats.
""For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,"" he said.
""This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.""
Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.
Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: ""We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.
""So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.""
As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.
""The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,"" Prof Thompson told BBC News.
The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.
The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, ""is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.""
The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.
Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.
Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had ""never seen anything like these bite marks"".
Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a ""short and somewhat brutal life"".
His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.
Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: ""This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.""
The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the ""presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death"", she said.
Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.
The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.
David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: ""We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat."""
Morris dancer set for 11-hour world record attempt,Duncan Bhaskaran Brown will try to dance for more than 11 hours straight in Abingdon on Saturday.,11 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg99yym52eo,"A man who is attempting to break the world record for the longest Morris dance said he chose the challenge because he ""didn't fancy"" climbing Everest or rowing the Atlantic.
Duncan Bhaskaran Brown will try to dance for more than 11 hours straight during his record attempt in Abingdon on Saturday.
He estimates that the challenge will see him take 100,000 steps and burn about 6,000 calories.
""There's no training plan for endurance Morris dancing, so we've had to write the book,"" he said.
On why he is attempting the challenge, he told the BBC: ""I didn't fancy Everest or rowing the Atlantic but I thought endurance Morris dancing was something I could very much do - it all grew from there.""
He said while he enjoys the dancing, he ""particularly loves the community that goes with it"", as well as the ""places we end up dancing"".
""And don't forget the silly hats, I love a silly hat,"" he said.
The attempt will begin at 05:00 BST in Abingdon Market Square, and has been officially recognised by Guinness World Records.
It is also a fundraiser for two local charities, One Planet Abingdon, which fights climate change and promotes sustainability, and the Abingdon and District Volunteer Centre.
""It'll be nice to see people cheering me on and supporting our amazing charities,"" he said.
""Even so, I expect the last few hours to be somewhat uncomfortable - I'll do my best to grin an bear it.""
Abingdon has a deep-rooted history of Morris dancing tradition, with the earliest newspaper record dating back to 1722.
""Abingdon has a wonderful, energetic dancing style, as well as a historic tradition and amazing people,"" Mr Bhaskaran Brown added.

Voters urged to register as deadline looms,Voters must be registered by 23:59 BST on Friday 11 April.,11 Apr 2025,Kent,https://www.bbc.com/articles/c78jj034762o,"Voters are reminded they have until 23:59 BST on Friday to vote
Voters in Kent will soon get to have their say over who is in charge of local services, from education to social care, libraries and road surfaces.
The deadline to register to vote is 23:59 BST on Friday 11 April and by 17:00 on Monday 14 April for postal votes.
Kent County Council (KCC) elections will take place on 1 May, with residents able to vote for 81 councillors across 72 divisions.
On polling day,  800 polling stations will be open across Kent from 07:00 until 22:00.
Last time these seats were contested, in 2021, the Conservatives secured an overwhelming victory, with around 70% of the seats on the council.
Local and mayoral contests can reflect voters' attitudes about neighbourhood concerns, such as when bins are collected, the state of parks and pavements, or access to libraries and hospitals.
But they can also be a verdict on how parties and leaders are handling national issues.
This year that could mean the NHS, the cost of living, or even foreign affairs such as the tariffs introduced by US president Donald Trump and the conflicts in Ukraine or the Middle East.
The elections are the first of their kind since Sir Keir Starmer became Prime Minister and since Kemi Badenoch took over as Conservative leader.
KCC has been Conservative-run since 1997 but political experts say the current climate means the outcome is by no means pre-determined.
Prof Richard Whitman from the University of Kent said: ""The national political picture has changed quite dramatically, obviously the Conservatives are no longer in power.
""The last time we had the KCC elections the Conservative party performed very strongly.
""The expectation this time is that other parties will challenge that, both at the level of Reform and the Labour party.
""But also the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and independent candidates who have performed strongly in the past.""
All voters intending to cast a ballot in the elections on May 1 will need to be registered and show a form of photo identification at the polling station.
Not all types of photo ID will be accepted, but a passport, driving licence or blue badge are valid.
Anyone without the correct identification will need to apply for a voter authority certificate by 17:00 on 23 April.

South America proposes 64-team 2030 World Cup,South American governing body Conmebol proposes expanding the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams.,11 Apr 2025,World Cup,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8jegenyx3vo,"The 2030 World Cup will be held in six nations across three continents
An official proposal to expand the men's 2030 World Cup to 64 teams has been put forward by South American governing body Conmebol.
The tournament will be hosted by Spain, Morocco and Portugal, after the opening matches are held in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
The 2026 World Cup will be the first with 48 teams but Conmebol wants to expand further for 2030 to mark the competition's 100-year anniversary.
""This will allow all countries to have the opportunity to live the world experience and so nobody on the planet is left out of the party,"" said Conmebol president Alejandro Dominguez at the body's congress on Thursday.
""We are convinced that the centennial celebration will be unique because 100 years are celebrated only once.""
The idea was first ""spontaneously raised"" at a Fifa Council meeting in March by Uruguayan Football Federation president Ignacio Alonso.
In a statement on Friday, Fifa said it had a ""duty to analyse any proposal from one of its Council members"".
Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, participated in Thursday's Conmebol Congress and highlighted the ""exceptional milestone"" the 2030 tournament would represent.
The decision to expand the 2026 World Cup to 48 teams was taken in 2017 following a unanimous vote at a Fifa congress.
Fifa's 75th congress will be held in Paraguay on 15 May, when Conmebol's proposal could be discussed.
Should the proposal eventually be accepted, the 2030 edition would include 128 matches - up from the 64-game format played between 1998 and 2022.
Critics of the expansion say it devalues the qualification process, while Environmental group Fossil Free Football said the decision to host the tournament across three continents was a ""climate nightmare"".
Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin described the proposal as a ""bad idea"" earlier this month.
""This proposal was maybe even more surprising for me than you. I think it is a bad idea,"" Ceferin said at a news conference.
The 2030 World Cup is being held across three continents for the first time.
Spain, Portugal and Morocco were named tournament hosts in 2024, with matches to be held in Argentina and Paraguay to mark the 100-year anniversary of the first World Cup tournament.
Uruguay - the inaugural winners of the competition in 1930 - have since been announced as co-hosts, with the country to host one game.
Would 48-team Women's World Cup be good for the game?

Just Stop Oil duo deny Tesla robot criminal damage,"Nigel Fleming, 63, and Catherine Nash, 74, are charged with causing £2,696.40 in criminal damage.",8 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn17204lxo,"Two Just Stop Oil protesters have denied criminal damage after liquid latex was poured over a robot at a Tesla store in west London.
Nigel Fleming, 63, and Catherine Nash, 74, were both charged with causing £2,696.40 in criminal damage after the incident at the Westfield Tesla store in Shepherd's Bush on 12 March.
Mr Fleming, of Worcester Crescent, London, was self-represented and pleaded not guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Ms Nash, of Castle Green Close, Kendal, Cumbria, who is also representing herself, appeared via video link, having pleaded not guilty at a previous hearing.
Mr Fleming said it was accepted that the pair carried out the action but they had a ""lawful excuse"".
He also told the court that the value of the damage was less than that alleged.
Mr Fleming said: ""We were very careful to try and make it so that the mannequin was not damaged, so I'm very surprised that there was damage to anything.""
The prosecution will give evidence on the value of the damage and that can be challenged, District Judge John Zani said.
Mr Fleming told the court that the action had been taken to ""draw attention to issues such as climate change"".
The charges allege that ""without lawful excuse"" they ""intended to destroy or damage"" the Optimus robot belonging to Tesla ""or were reckless as to whether that would happen"".
Both defendants were granted conditional bail until their trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 24 September.

When Mourinho ghosted Eto'o to get best out of him,Jose Mourinho reveals his inspired psychological tactics which helped Inter Milan win the Champions League in new BBC Sport documentary.,15 Apr 2025,European Football,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwynnyrq091o,"Samuel Eto'o played under Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan and Chelsea
It is early 2010 in northern Italy.
The Champions League knockout stage is under way and Inter Milan are preparing to travel to Stamford Bridge with a one-goal first-leg lead, following a 2-1 triumph in the San Siro a few weeks earlier.
Inter manager Jose Mourinho should be worrying about how to protect that slender lead against his former employers.
Having won the Champions League in 2004 with Porto, his career in Europe since then has been one of near misses and might-have-beens, most notably with the 2005 ghost goal semi-final defeat against Liverpool while managing Chelsea.
Mourinho is indeed knee-deep in one of his meticulous, manipulative, man-management moments that he hopes will become a masterclass, but could just as easily backfire spectacularly.
The pre-match news conference surely? An incendiary remark about the opposition? Or an outlandish dig at the referee appointed for the big match?
No. In fact it's a more inward-looking, insular moment that the man himself reveals in an in-depth exclusive interview for the BBC Sport documentary How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho.

How Jose Mourinho got the best out of Inter Milan striker Sameul Eto'o
Inter forward Samuel Eto'o was desperate to be a part of the last-16 second-leg tie at Stamford Bridge.
Mourinho was equally keen on Eto'o's involvement - he'd been a key lieutenant in their run to the knockout stage having signed from Barcelona the summer before. But, Mourinho believed he could glean an extra few percent out of the Cameroonian if he told him the completely opposite.
Less ghost goal, more ghosting.
""Psychology is part of the job and is part of the game with the players,"" said Mourinho.
""The way you deal with the press is not going to win matches. Not at all.
""But, with the players? Yes. And, you know, I had I think, hundreds of players [during my career].
""I always looked at each one of them as a different guy than the other guys. Every person is one individual.
""I give you an example of a very strong-minded guy, Samuel Eto'o. The week before that match at Stamford Bridge, I fought him every day. Big, big discussions, big level of pressure.
""I told him: 'I'm not going to play you. You are not in your best level. You are not going to play'.
""He said: 'Please Mr, let me play'.
""I said: 'No, there is no 'please Mr' - you are not going to play. You are not performing. I don't trust you'.
""It was one week of an emotional work with him.""
Samuel Eto'o scored in the 78th minute to help Inter Milan win 1-0 at Stamford Bridge and 3-1 on aggregate
Mourinho has been infamous for his emotional pre-match mind games throughout his career. The pre-match news conference effectively acting as a de-facto kick-off for the game itself.
But, usually, this manipulation was trained on the opposition, not his own squad. So, how did Eto'o react?
""Samuel won us that quarter-final against Chelsea. He scored the winning goal at Stamford Bridge. He played a fantastic match,"" says Mourinho of a performance from Eto'o in which he scored the only goal and sent the Italian side through to the quarter-finals of a tournament they would go on to win.
""He was such a strong guy that I knew that he would react the way he did react.""
How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho focuses on the Portuguese manager's two Champions League triumphs - in 2004, with Porto, and that 2010 win with Inter.
Modern-day Mourinho has had his man-management sometimes called into question - think Dele Alli at Tottenham and Paul Pogba at Manchester United.
But, as the Portuguese manager happily explains, and Eto'o embodied, Mourinho, circa 2010, was in his perfect phase of extracting the best from his players. It's a bullish approach that feels a little outdated in the current climate of player power - but, as Eto'o and Mourinho explain, it worked perfectly back then.
""It made me extremely happy that Mourinho told me he needed me to do something particular,"" Eto'o said at the time. ""He wanted a very disciplined role and, because I respect him so much, I said, 'Yes, coach' and stuck to my task exactly.""
Fifteen years later, in a west London hotel, Mourinho is similarly happy to reflect on his methodology.
""That individual way of communicating, of motivation, is always something very, very important,"" he says. ""There is no secret. It is just to look at each one of them, to know them, to understand them, and to deal with them as a complete individual. Like you would if you had one son and one daughter.â¯You cannot educate both in the same way because they are different.""

Low carbon farming 'essential' for climate goals,"The Climate Change Committee says the executive ""will need to broaden and accelerate action"".",19 Mar 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1en2dzw6eyo,"Low carbon farming practices are ""essential"" to meeting Northern Ireland's climate goals, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says.
And the executive ""will need to broaden and accelerate action from today"".
The CCC has recommended a 77% reduction in overall emissions by 2040 in its advice on Northern Ireland's fourth carbon budget.
As part of a new pathway to reach the legally-binding 2050 net zero target, the CCC has made 18 priority recommendations, including decarbonising electricity supply, support for low-carbon home heating and increasing infrastructure for electric vehicle charging.
In a statement, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs of Northern Ireland (DAERA) said it welcomed the publication of the CCC's advice which ""will need to be carefully considered by DAERA and by other departments to help inform the best pathway for Northern Ireland to decarbonise and to deliver on our net zero ambition in line with the principles of a Just Transition.""
It added that a 16-week public consultation will be carried out, with a view to progressing legislation before the end of 2025.
Carbon budgets set out how much carbon can be emitted over a period of time.
The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, said the team was ""delighted"" to be able to present a ""good news story"" about how Northern Ireland can decarbonise.
""To deliver against its ambitious climate commitments, immediate action is necessary.
""Action by government, businesses, and farmers can drive a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, boost investment, and benefit households.""
The Ulster Farmers Union (UFU) says the budgetary recommendations laid out by the CCC highlight the ""drastic measures required to meet the unrealistic net zero goal in Northern Ireland (NI) by 2050"".
In a statement the UFC said it has ""consistently opposed forced cuts to livestock numbers, which would devastate rural communities and our national food security"" and urged that ""food production and climate action must be balanced"".
It added that ""farmers are committed to emissions reductions but must not be unfairly targeted"" and warned that ""suppressing local food production will only increase reliance on imports from countries with higher emissions"".
Advice from the CCC is not policy but is usually accepted by governments.
Its recommendations for the first, second and third carbon budgets in Northern Ireland were put into law by the Assembly in December.
Electrification of technologies in transport, buildings, and industry, with the expansion and decarbonisation of the electricity system, will deliver 55% of the reductions required to meet the fourth budget.
While devolved authorities don't have control over all the areas, the executive does have power to act on the build-out of clean electricity, charging infrastructure for cars, and electric heating.
Acting on these would ""significantly contribute"" towards Northern Ireland's ambition as well as creating opportunities for new jobs, the CCC says.
It expects much of the needed investment to come from the private sector, but adds that government support is required for woodland creation and peatland restoration.
The CCC anticipates that demand for electricity will more than double as electrification replaces fossil fuels in home heating and domestic transport.
Low-carbon fuels, carbon capture and storage, low-carbon farming and nature-based measures will also make ""important contributions"".
More than three-fifths of the reductions required to meet the fourth budget will come from the domestic transport, buildings, and agriculture and land use sectors.
Agriculture is the largest contributor of greenhouse gases in Northern Ireland.
It is ""essential"" that low carbon farming practices are developed, according to the CCC.
And farmers should be encouraged ""to diversify land use from livestock farming to measures such as peatland restoration and woodland creation"".
Even then, ""engineered removals"" will have to be ramped up in the fourth carbon budget to keep Northern Ireland on track.
These are human-made processes to take carbon from the atmosphere and permanently lock it away.
They include Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage, or DACCS, as well as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).
The CCC has relocated DACCS into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK to model the pathway and says the executive would have to ensure conditions are in place to attract operators.
It adds that other choices could be taken by the Northern Ireland Executive.
The advice goes beyond what the CCC set out as Northern Ireland's contribution to the UK's Balanced Pathway in its seventh carbon budget.
That is because the CCC believes Northern Ireland's legally-binding 2050 Net Zero target requires a more ambitious effort."
Work begins to restore stream for fish and wildlife,Lustrum Beck is undergoing work which hopes to attract creatures including water voles and otters.,11 Apr 2025,Tees,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y66dkex0qo,"Work has begun to improve a stream to encourage more wildlife and migrating fish to return to the area.
Lustrum Beck in Stockton, Teesside, has been heavily modified over the years, resulting in the loss of habitats and restricting fish movement.
Tees Rivers Trust chief executive Ben Lamb said on the surface it seemed ""devoid of life"" but actually contained shrimp, the endangered European eel, otters, kingfishers and water vole.
The Environment Agency (EA) said it hoped the work would encourage nature to flourish.
The project is part of the £30m Tees Tidelands Programme, which aims to help the River Tees estuaries and tributaries adapt to climate change and improve habitats.
The work will span just under a mile (1.5km) of the river and includes lowering embankments to connect the beck to riverside ponds.
Mr Lamb said: ""There is a huge amount of work to be done to improve the beck and this project will create more habitat and flow diversity within the channel which will provide more opportunity for a range of species to thrive.""
Shallow dips, called scrapes, will also be created to collect water and provide habitats for wildlife such as wading birds.
The organisation's project executive Paul Eckersley said the work would ""bring a welcome boost to biodiversity in the heart of Stockton after decades of modification"".

Morris dancer completes 11-hour world record attempt,"Duncan Bhaskaran Brown estimates he danced 100,000 steps to 186 traditional folk tunes.",12 Apr 2025,Oxfordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lmjvg7rnmo,"A man is hoping he has set a new world record after Morris dancing for more than 11 hours straight.
Duncan Bhaskaran Brown from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, began his solo challenge in traditional Morris attire in the town centre just after 05:00 BST and finished at 16:09 BST.
It amounted to more than 100,000 steps and 6,000 burned calories, which is ""equivalent to about seven and a half full English breakfasts"", estimated Mr Bhaskaran Brown.
His attempt, which had been officially recognised by Guinness World Records, also raised more than £1,500 for two local charities.
Mr Bhaskaran Brown said the event had started ""quietly and without fanfare"" before ending ""in spectacular style"", with about 50 fellow dancers joining him for the finale.
The challenge, which featured 186 traditional folk tunes, was observed by independent witnesses to ensure full compliance with Guinness's strict guidelines.
His attempt will undergo final verification before it can be officially entered into the record books.
""It got tough towards the end, my legs were really starting to hurt,"" he said.
""I know I'm going to feel it tomorrow.
""It was amazing to see all the support today, not just for me but for both the charities we've been supporting.""
He said he was pleased to have raised funds for One Planet Abingdon, which fights climate change and promotes sustainability, and the Abingdon and District Volunteer Centre.
""They're both doing amazing work, and some people who've benefited from that work helped out today,"" he said.

Leader 'instrumental' in growth of wildlife group,Chief executive Leigh Morris is set to leave the Manx Wildlife Trust after five years in the post.,6 Apr 2025,Isle of Man,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2d2lrd018o,"A conservation group leader who has been ""instrumental"" in ensuing the growth of the organisation is moving on after five years in the post.
Manx Wildlife Trust chief executive Leigh Morris will leave the post in May to take on the role of Director of International Nature and Climate at the Wildlife Trusts.
Mr Morris, who took up the post in September 2019, said he was leaving with a ""sense of pride "" in what had been accomplished and ""a deep confidence in the team"".
His new role, which works with an association of 46 local trusts including the Isle of Man, aims to bridge the gap between local conservation efforts and global environmental challenges.
He said the last five years had been ""a wonderful chapter of my life"", and he was ""particularly proud"" of the work carried out during the group's 50th anniversary in 2023  and its receipt of the King's Award for Voluntary Service.
""Though I will be embarking on a new chapter, I know that my connection to MWT and the Isle of Man is far from over,"" he added.
A spokesman for the Manx Wildlife Trust said that Mr Morris had been ""instrumental"" in expanding the charity's work and ""ensuring its growth"".
He would continue to be involved in the Inter-island Environment Meeting, which will be hosted on the Isle of Man for the first time in September.

Europe's most exciting getaways for 2025 travel,"From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.",9 Apr 2025,Travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250407-best-european-vacation-destinations,"From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.
While much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.
This is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval – and rows with locals – in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.
These are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.
Puglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays – still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.
""The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie (farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,"" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. ""The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,"" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.
Tran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves – plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.
Best time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.
Portugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.
""Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,"" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey – especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.
Who picked the list?
Stacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.
The area's ""mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe"" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.
Évora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed Festas dos Santos Populares (Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm – including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.
Best time to visit: Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.
About five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier – both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks – specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (£89.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.
However, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel – including a seemingly endless supply of fondue – and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.
Best time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.
Cap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the Côted'Azur – an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy – and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.
The iconic Belles Rives hotel – Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s – is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. ""The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,"" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.
Beyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacré, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.
Best time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.
While Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.
At just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a ""small but mighty country"", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, ""from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave"", are a primary draw, he adds.

Independent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds ""Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,"" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.
To explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.
Best time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.
The Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine – specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.
Of the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani – the rugged middle finger – stands out. ""Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,"" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. ""This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance."" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with ""a deep-rooted history"", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.
Elsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.
Best time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.
Paris had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.
What parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. ""Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,"" he explains, ""but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture – there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too."" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic Hôtel du Savoir, formerly called the Hôtel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Prés and is, let's just say, trés chic.
Best time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.
Tourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the ""coolcation"" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.
While many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light – minus the crowds and queues of the capital.
It's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohuslän archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.
Best time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.
Albania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes – which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.
""Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,"" says Denison. ""The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokastër, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.""
New infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. ""Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,"" Denison adds.
While hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.
Best time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania – and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.

Geothermal energy plan for university buildings,The University of York scheme will also look at ways to reduce fossil fuel use across the city.,10 Apr 2025,North Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05nnm1p6vqo,"A project to use geothermal heat to decarbonise a university's campus has been launched.
The University of York scheme, which has been allocated £35m in funding from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, will also look at ways to reduce fossil fuel use across the city.
Vice-Chancellor Prof Charlie Jeffery said the campus's location on a site of  ""significant geothermal potential"" made it an ideal place for the plan.
He said: ""This geothermal project is more than just a sustainable energy initiative; it is a living laboratory that will drive research, educate our students and benefit our community.""
The initial three-year phase of the project would focus on developing a sustainable heat source to supply the majority of the university's buildings, while also ""fostering a new generation of sustainable energy experts"", the university said.
The next phase of the project would ""delve into the potential for on-campus electricity generation and the expansion of heat capacity to benefit the wider York community"".
The funding came from the government's Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme,  delivered by Salix Finance.
The university said assessment work for the project had been done, with the next phase being the planning process and regulatory approvals.

How much vital UK infrastructure does China own?,BBC Verify looks at what we know about the extent of Chinese investment in the UK economy.,15 Apr 2025,BBC Verify,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4w3y4pdkzo,"The fate of the Scunthorpe steel works has shone a fresh spotlight on Chinese investment in the UK economy with critics raising questions over potential security risks.
The British Steel plant had been owned by China's Jingye Steel.
But the UK government has now taken control of the Scunthorpe site, amid claims the Chinese owners were planning to permanently decommission its two blast furnaces and use its rolling mills to process imported Chinese-made metal instead.
BBC Verify looks at what we know about the extent of Chinese investment in the UK economy - and how much of a concern it should be.
Data from the Office for National Statistics suggests total Chinese investment in the UK in 2023 amounted to about £4.3bn - a small fraction of the total £2 trillion  of overseas investment in the British economy in that year.
However, this is likely to be a considerable underrepresentation of the true scale of Chinese investment in the UK because the official data only includes the immediate investing country, not the ultimate source of the money - and because of a lack of transparency from Beijing when it comes to overseas ownership stakes.
Independent estimates from the American Enterprise Institute think tank, using corporate reports, suggest total public and private Chinese investment in the UK between 2005 and 2024 added up to $105bn, or £82bn.
This would have made Britain the third largest national destination of Chinese investment over this period, after only the US and Australia.
There is a wide range of Chinese investment in the UK, ranging from critical energy and transport infrastructure, to stakes in private companies and football clubs.
Significant Chinese investments in UK infrastructure include a 10% stake in London's Heathrow airport by the China Investment Corporation, a sovereign wealth fund wholly owned by the Chinese state.
The Hong Kong-based industrialist Li Ka-shing's investment group owns UK Power Networks, which operates electricity distribution infrastructure across London, the South East of England and the East of England.
The billionaire's group also owns a 75% stake in Northumbrian Water Group, which provides water supply and sewerage in the north east of England.
There is also a large Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset.
China General Nuclear Power Group originally had a 33.5% stake, with the rest owned by the French company EDF.
But EDF reports that the Chinese company has stopped contributing additional financing to the joint project - which has been running over budget - and, as a result the Chinese stake at the end of last year had declined to 27.4%.
The same Chinese company has an even larger stake - 66.5% - in the proposed Bradwell B nuclear site in Essex, according to the project website. EDF owns the rest.
Chinese companies have backed significant investments in the battery sector too.
The Minety battery site in Wiltshire is one of the largest energy storage projects in Europe. It was funded and constructed by Huaneng, a Chinese state-owned company which also operates the facility.
""The biggest growth of investment in Europe by Chinese firms is in EV [electric vehicle] batteries and much of this is private firms rather than Chinese state-owned firms,"" says Professor Giles Mohan of the Open University.
The Hangzhou-based Chinese car company, Geely Auto, owns the Coventry-headquartered London EV Company, which manufactures electric black taxis.
The drive to achieve climate targets in the UK and Europe has welcomed Chinese investment in other green energy sectors like wind farms.
Red Rock Renewables, which is owned by the Chinese state-controlled SDIC Power, has a 25% share in the Beatrice offshore wind farm in Scotland.
As for investment in consumer brands, Li Ka-shing's group owns the Suffolk-headquartered pub chain and brewery Greene King.
Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club is owned by the Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun.
While Jingye steel had total control of the Scunthorpe steel plant, it's important to bear in mind that Chinese investors do not always have majority stakes in UK businesses, which would interfere with their ability to determine those companies' operational decisions.
Some of these organisations such as airports and water utilities are also tightly regulated, potentially limiting the freedom of manoeuvre of their Chinese owners in controlling the assets.
Chinese investors are also estimated to have considerable holdings of UK land and buildings.
The Leadenhall Building, known as the ""cheesegrater"", in the City of London was acquired by a Chinese property investor for £1.15bn in 2017.
The potential danger posed by Chinese investment in UK infrastructure has been extensively debated in recent years - and a particular flashpoint was the involvement of the Shenzhen-based Chinese technology company Huawei in building the UK's 5G communications infrastructure.
Huawei was founded by Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese army officer, in 1987.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre initially judged in 2019 that any risk posed by Huawei was manageable.
But the UK, nevertheless, required the Chinese company to begin pulling out of the UK's telecoms infrastructure in 2020, after coming under pressure from the US government during Donald Trump's first term as President.
The involvement of Huawei in UK networks was also opposed by a number of MPs.
Grace Theodoulou, policy fellow on China at the Council on Geostrategy, says there are two main potential threats to consider for Chinese investment in UK critical infrastructure.
""The first is the potential for espionage – for example, having Chinese-made audiovisual equipment installed in government buildings or devices.
""The second is the infrastructure can be controlled by the manufacturer and, as such, could be disrupted for geopolitical leverage,"" she said.
Some analysts argue that Chinese law - which mandates all Chinese companies to align closely with Chinese Communist Party directives and to assist with national intelligence efforts - represents an inherent security risk in all Chinese investments in Western infrastructure.
""A likely scenario where it might be in China's interests [to harm UK infrastructure] would be to impede Britain's ability to impose sanctions against Beijing in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
""If China were to invade Taiwan, and should they have control over parts of our critical infrastructure, it would highly impact the potential to enforce sanctions or similar measures,"" Ms Theodoulou said.
However, other analysts are sceptical over whether it would be in the financial interest of Chinese investors to sabotage UK infrastructure or firms, as such actions would collapse the value of their investments and likely lead to their appropriation by the UK government.
""This threat is asserted and not proven, and these companies are profit-driven so it is not in their interests to sabotage our infrastructure,"" said Prof Giles Mohan.
And they argue that a distinction should be drawn between Chinese investments in vital infrastructure and investments into UK firms which own consumer brands where the potential for public harm is considerably lower.

Port revamp and seafront 'oasis' work moves nearer,Leigh Port would be improved at a cost of £14.8m under plans submitted by the council.,12 Apr 2025,Essex,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vegz2lpzvo,"A £2m project to tackle seafront flooding is set to get under way, while a £14.8m regeneration of a port has moved a step closer.
Southend-on-Sea City Council has submitted a planning application to renovate Leigh Port which, if approved, would bring improvements to part of Leigh's historic Old Town.
The separate £2m scheme on Southend's Marine Parade will see the creation of a ""green oasis"" featuring a large green space with a small stream, canopies and a series of rain gardens with hydro-rocks to absorb water and prevent flooding.
Both schemes have been funded by the government's Levelling up Fund, Southend Council, Anglian Water and the Regional Flood and Coastal Committee.
The Leigh plans would see a new quay wall installed, the resurfacing of the quay and a small craft club demolished.
Labour's Lydia Hyde, cabinet member for climate, environment and waste, said: ""We're continuing to work with key partners to make sure the project protects our environment and is delivered in a cost-effective way.""
The scheme would see a new surface and trade waste drainage system and the dredging of Leigh Port's channel from Belton Way downstream along Lower Leigh Creek.
Previously, the plans were delayed while work was carried out to ensure there would be no significant environmental impacts.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said the scheme would enlarge the berth area of the port and make it safer, reduce the flood risk, improve water quality and reduce congestion in the High Street.
Ms Hyde said the Marine Parade scheme would be delivered in phases and the first would start ""imminently"".
""This will focus on the junction at Hartington Road and Seaway, where we'll be realigning kerb lines to create a rain garden that collects and stores surface water runoff,"" she said.
""Phase two - the north side of Marine Parade - and phase three - the south side of Marine Parade - will follow, and we'll continue to share updates as the project progresses.
""We'll be working closely with stakeholders to minimise disruption and make sure the programme doesn't impact the summer season.""

"Toad patrol helps 50,000 to breeding grounds","The group oversees the Charlcombe Lane road closure, with volunteers ensuring the safe passage of toads.",11 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeww55l5zzo,"A toad patrol group is celebrating after successfully helping 50,000 amphibians reach their breeding grounds over the past three decades.
The Charlcombe Toad Rescue Group hopped to the aid of nearly 4,000 toads, frogs and newts as they crossed Charlcombe Lane, near Bath, during this year's migration season alone.
A 0.5 mile (0.8km) stretch of the road has been closed for six weeks between February and March each year since 2003 to prevent the migrating toads from being squashed by traffic.
About 50 volunteers go on patrol each night and have spent more than 600 hours a year helping amphibians make the crossing.
The group has been closing the road in agreement with Bath and North East Somerset Council for more than 20 years. It is one of only four closures of its kind in the country.
Chris Melbourne, who manages the collection of data for the Charlcombe Toad Rescue said it had been a ""game changer"" for the local amphibian population.
He said reaching the milestone of helping 50,000 amphibians could not have been done without the support of nearby residents.
Before the closure of Charlcombe Lane, the casualty amphibian casualty rate during mating season was 62%. In 2025, it was 3%.
There was an exciting first for the rescuers in 2025, with a Great Crested Newt spotted for the first time the group's history.
The volunteers take every precaution to escort the migration, using latex-free, powder-free gloves so as to avoid any chemicals from their hands harming the amphibians.
The group says changes in the climate make it harder for the group to keep of the toads.
Mr Melbourne said it was becoming ""increasingly difficult"" to predict the peak times for amphibian movements.
""Closing the road for six weeks makes such a difference,"" he added.

A tale of two South East high streets,BBC South East speaks to shoppers and high street businesses in Leatherhead and Chatham.,14 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kvvwnzgkno,"A difficult financial climate and declining footfall are making it harder to become a high street success story.
This is certainly the case in the Surrey town of Leatherhead and Chatham in Kent, both of which are at the centre of regeneration plans.
While the projects promise plenty, businesses are trying to survive amid quieter high streets and greater overheads.
BBC South East has been out to meet shoppers and businesses over a busy Easter holiday break to get their views on their high street.
Leatherhead resident Paul thinks the town should be ""more successful than it is"".
""The money's here, there's lots of wealthy people here but they don't shop in Leatherhead,"" he said.
According to data from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), Mole Valley - the main towns of which are Dorking and Leatherhead - saw a 13% reduction in retail businesses between 2023 and 2024.
Mole Valley District Council (MVDC) says this figure is based on ""misrepresenting data"" due to some businesses being incorrectly classified.
Lucio Dilena, the owner of Lucio's Coffee & Deli, admits the town ""does lack in footfall"" but says a good reputation ensures his business remains strong.
Lucio really notices a difference on the days when there are market stalls on the high street.
""It's great, because if the town's busy, everyone's busy,"" he added.
MVDC said its Transform Leatherhead regeneration programme aims to ""revitalise"" Leatherhead town centre and reposition the town by providing a ""wider mix of uses to meet the evolving function of our town centres"".
From the 14-18th April, BBC South East will be getting out and about on our region's high streets. Catch up on BBC South East Today on BBC iPlayer and listen to BBC Radio Kent, Sussex and Surrey on BBC Sounds.
James, who works in the Chatham Intra - the town's creative and heritage quarter - said: ""I've seen the creative community develop since I've been working here.""
That marries up with the IBDR statistics, which show an increase in retail businesses from 685 in 2023 to 710 in 2024.
Antwon feels the high street is ""getting there slowly but surely"", adding that ""development is the key"".
Sam Maric and Sara Woodley have been running No.64 Coffee & Brunch in the heart of Chatham for just over five years.
""We just open every day and see what comes,"" Sam said, describing business as ""totally unpredictable"".
Having survived the pandemic, Sam says they are now experiencing ""worse"" cost of living pressures.
Until last year, Matt Simms was able to rely on small business rate relief for the Unique Boxing & Kickboxing Gym, which has been on the high street for 15 years.
In April, a 75% discount to rates was replaced by a discount of 40%, up to a maximum of £110,000.
Matt's £957 charge in 2024 rose to £2,794 this year.
A government spokesperson said: ""We have protected the smallest businesses from the employer National Insurance rise and late payments, protecting 250,000 retail, hospitality and leisure business properties from paying full business rates and capping corporation tax.""
The spokesperson added: ""We are a pro-business government, and we know the vital importance of small businesses to our economy.""
Matt says he is ""having to try to evaluate different ways of how to absorb those costs"".
He admits it's ""tough"" to operate in this part of the high street but feels his gym offers people a sense of belonging.
Dr Tim Aker, development manager of the Federation of Small Business in Kent and Medway, believes the high street is in a ""disastrous"" state.
""I started in this role at the tail end of Covid. It was better then,"" he says, blaming the cost of living crisis.
He said when the middle class feel the pinch ""that's when small businesses suffer"".
The recent increase to employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) has been particularly difficult, he added.
Though a gloomy picture, Tim is confident businesses can recover but need to be confident that ""there aren't going to be any more fiscal shocks"".
A spokesperson for Medway Council said: ""We recognise Chatham High Street has suffered particularly since the pandemic and needs help to once again become the vibrant town centre it was loved for.
""Nevertheless, millions of pounds are being invested in Chatham's town centre, and there is still much on offer including  independent shops, thriving theatre and award winning café and art gallery.""

Six moments that mattered as Leeds won promotion,"From a slow start to a silent January and changing goalkeepers with seven games left, BBC Sport looks at the key moments in Leeds' promotion campaign.",21 Apr 2025,Leeds,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c793r3l718jo,"Leeds United players stayed at Elland Road to celebrate their promotion on Monday night
Leeds United have sealed their return to the Premier League after two years back in the Championship.
From a slow start to a silent January and changing goalkeepers with seven games to go, BBC Sport looks at the key moments in their successful promotion campaign.
Eight months is a long, long time in football and so it was that the mood around Leeds United three games into the season was in stark contrast to the one there now.
A helter-skelter 3-3 opening-day draw with Portsmouth was followed up by a thumping 3-0 home defeat by Middlesbrough in the Carabao Cup and then an uninspiring 0-0 draw at West Bromwich Albion.
The Whites headed to Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday on a Friday night with the pressure on to get their season kick-started.
Brenden Aaronson celebrates scoring their first goal in the 2-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday
Adam Pope
BBC Radio Leeds reporter
Off the back of a mind-numbingly boring goalless draw at West Brom, the climate ahead of the trip to Hillsborough felt like that around the Birmingham City defeat early on in the previous season.
Did Leeds have enough players to challenge for promotion? Georginio Rutter was on his way to Brighton, following Archie Gray and Crysencio Summerville to the Premier League. Was Willy Gnonto next to go before the window shut?
A clean sheet and a first victory of the campaign in what Farke described ""the perfect away performance"" allayed the fears of some fans who were considering whether to let Brenden Aaronson back into their lives after he had returned following jumping ship to Germany for a season.
His goal and the quality of Dan James' finish provided some evidence that Patrick Bamford's prophecy may prove true when he told his podcast partner Joe Wilkinson that week: ""Every time that I've been in a team when we haven't gone up, we've done it the next year. Hopefully that's a good omen!""
Farke admitted after the game that more additions were needed and wingers Largie Ramazani and Manor Solomon duly arrived before deadline day.
A candle of hope had been lit.
Two defeats in their 12 matches after the Sheffield Wednesday win had seen Leeds cruise up towards the top two places.
A comfortable 2-0 win over Sheffield United in October had seen Blades boss Chris Wilder call them the best team in the division and by late November it was becoming hard to argue.
Adam Pope
BBC Radio Leeds reporter
Then Swansea City head coach Luke Williams said before the game he fully expected Leeds United to be promoted having gone so close last season but he could not have predicted the glut of goals which followed on a weekend where Storm Bert had wreaked havoc throughout south Wales.
The fact Leeds scored four times was a big deal because the Swans had not conceded more than a single goal in 17 matches up to that point.
Gnonto came off the bench to score the winner very late on after Leeds let a 3-2 lead slip, having earlier twice come from behind. It showed the fighting spirit was there if not game management and sent Leeds top for the first time this season on goal difference.
Willy Gnonto takes in the adulation from the Leeds fans after his last-minute winner at Swansea
Sometimes the wisest thing to do is nothing at all.
With his side in scintillating form, Farke had been adamant he would only look to make additions if they were better than what he had.
Southampton striker Cameron Archer was linked with a move but it came to nothing and, two days before the transfer window closed, the Whites demolished struggling Cardiff 7-0.
Transfer deadline day passed without a single addition.
Adam Pope
BBC Radio Leeds reporter
It felt like Leeds had gambled. Everybody knew the squad as it stood had the ability to win the league but the point was how much of it would still be standing if injuries hit?
How costly would it be not to sign a number nine with Patrick Bamford a long-term injury,  or a proper number 10, and not to provide cover at centre-back? These were the big questions in the wake of a window which saw their main rivals strengthen while Leeds were left lighter.
Two days later United went to in-form Coventry City and won 2-0 and it could have been 12. Farke and the owners had rolled the dice. It looked like it could be paying off.
Ao Tanaka headed Leeds into the lead late on at Sheffield United before Joel Piroe's thumping finish sealed the win
Leeds headed into mid-February in great shape before back-to-back Monday night challenges against top-four rivals, Sunderland and Sheffield United.
The former took an early lead at Elland Road through Wilson Isidor and with time running out it looked like the Whites were going to fall to a damaging defeat.
Centre-back Pascal Struijk was the unlikely hero against the Black Cats as the Dutchman, on as a sub, headed in two wicked deliveries from fellow replacement Joe Rothwell to produce a dramatic turnaround.
Leeds would head to Bramall Lane top of the table.
Adam Pope
BBC Radio Leeds reporter
Five points clear at the top and for many it felt like promotion was guaranteed.
After the game left-back Junior Firpo gave a timely reminder that everyone should just calm down. He talked of the need to ""stay humble"", that the job was ""not done yet"". He was right and he was also correct about how powerful Leeds were late on in games.
Once the Dominican Republic international had deservedly equalised with a thumping header with 18 minutes remaining, Blades boss Chris Wilder and assistant Alan Knill looked spooked on the touchline.
Defeat looked inevitable for the hosts from that moment and Leeds did not disappoint. A precision header from Ao Tanaka and a rip-snorter from Joel Piroe ignited euphoria in the away end inside an otherwise empty Bramall Lane on full time.
Leeds had seen it through in a massive game.
Illan Meslier has not featured for Leeds since his mistake in the 2-2 draw with Swansea
Promotion had felt inevitable after those raucous Monday night wins in February but March brought the kind of jeopardy Whites fans had feared.
The unbeaten run which stretched back to a 1-0 reverse at Blackburn on 30 November was ended on 9 March by a 1-0 defeat at struggling Portsmouth.
Although Millwall were despatched 2-0 three days later Farke's men then needed to recover from a horror start at QPR to escape with a 2-2 draw.
The international break looked like it had come at a good time to reset and refocus, with the lead over third-placed Burnley cut from seven points to just two.
Managerless Swansea arrived in town in poor form and hopes were high of a return to winning ways.
Adam Pope
BBC Radio Leeds reporter
Gnonto looked to have won the game from the bench late on to send Leeds top and rescue goalkeeper Illan Meslier after a calamitous drop under no pressure had gifted Swansea an equaliser.
But Meslier eventually cost his side top spot and himself a place in the side thereafter by allowing another equaliser to squeeze through him from a tight angle in the final seconds.
The credit for his earlier penalty save was completely eradicated as it felt like a defeat and the Frenchman's litany of errors was now too severe for him to keep his place.
""You have to suffer a little bit,"" Farke told the press after the game and that, despite March seeing them slip from first to third amid a run of one win in five games, he was ""100% confident his side would be playing Premier League football next season.""
Many were sceptical, others called for a head which was keeping composed when some were being lost.
Karl Darlow was given the gloves for the draw at Luton the week after the Swansea debacle.
There was little he could do to stop Isaiah Jones netting the opener before James levelled with a fine finish but some fans were unhappy that Farke called the point against the strugglers a good result as their own poor run stretched to one win in six.
However, Sheffield United's unexpected loss at Oxford later that day, when a win would have moved them four points clear of the Whites, proved Farke's words correct.
The battling 1-0 midweek win at play-off chasing Middlesbrough ended a run of three straight draws and, as the Blades lost at home to Millwall, Leeds had turned third back to first in no time at all heading into the final five matches.
Leeds players showed their appreciation after the 2-1 win over Preston
Adam Pope
BBC Radio Leeds reporter
This was a battering for Preston make no mistake.
Leeds backed up a gritty win at Middlesbrough to produce a cracking performance under intense pressure to hit the top of the table. Joel Piroe should have had a hat-trick but his battling and link-up play were intrinsic to United carving Preston apart. With James injured it needed him and Manor Solomon to step up. The latter was unplayable at times and scored a curling pearler in the first five minutes to set Leeds on their way.
Once in front Leeds do not lose and so it proved.
The news filtering through from Home Park of a third consecutive defeat for Sheffield United created an incredible atmosphere inside Elland Road for the latter stages of the match.
Coinciding with concrete news from the club's owners that, in tandem with the council, steps were definitely being taken to expand its capacity the famous old stadium provided a timely reminder of how unique it is as a footballing experience.
A free bar was laid on afterwards to say thank you to the fans - pints and points on a pivotal day.

Firefighters tackle third hillside wildfire,The fire near Inverkip broke out as emergency services said blazes in Galloway and the Highlands had been brought under control.,7 Apr 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98gy8mlleno,"Firefighters have tackled a wildfire which broke out on a hillside in Inverclyde.
Huge plumes of smoke could be seen billowing over a forest near Inverkip on Monday night.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it had sent a single engine and its crew to put out the blaze.
Meanwhile, fire crews spent another day at the scene of two wildfires that were burning over the weekend in parts of Scotland.
A blaze began in the Glen Trool area of the Galloway Forest Park on Thursday, which then spread to Loch Doon in East Ayrshire.
The Scottish government said the fire was now ""under control"", after its resilience room met on Sunday evening.
Meanwhile, in the Highlands Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) crews have been tackling a wildfire in Stac Pollaidh, at Inverpolly Forest near Ullapool.
SFRS said the Stac Pollaidh fire had been put out by 19:30, but the situation would be monitored overnight before crews return to check in the morning.
Justice Secretary Angela Constance, praised emergency services for their work at the Galloway blaze.
""I am extremely grateful to all the first responders who have been working hard to control this fire,"" she said.
""I am reassured to hear that so far there has been no damage to properties or mature woodland.""
Helicopters had been deployed to water-bomb the fire over the weekend.
Five groups of walkers were located on the hills on Friday night, but were moved away from the area.
Among those rescued were Bruce Marbrow and his son Jack, 13, who had travelled from Yorkshire for a trip with friend Scott Rayner and his son Frankie, 13, to camp in Galloway Forest Park.
When they saw smoke in the distance, the campers attributed it to the controlled burning of heather, not realising the flames were from a wildfire, The Scotsman newspaper reported.
Mr Marbrow told The Scotsman the fire was a ""proper inferno"" about 20m (66ft) away from where they intended to camp.
They were rescued at about 04:00 on Saturday by the HM Coastguard search and rescue helicopter.
Police Scotland said on Monday afternoon a number of areas were still affected, including Merrick, Millmore and Macaterick, and that the public should continue to avoid affected areas.
A fire engine remained at the scene overnight on Sunday, while another was despatched on Monday morning.
In the Highlands, five fire engines were at the scene of the blaze on Monday and people have been advised to stay away from the area.
The A835, which was closed at the junction for Achiltibuie and the junction for Badnagyle due to the wildfire, has now re-opened.
Rising temperatures across the UK have led to wildfire warnings being put in place for several parts of the country.
Together with the Scottish Wildfire Forum, the SFRS urged people to avoid lighting fires outdoors across all areas of Scotland.
Ms Constance added: ""As we continue to see a period of warm and dry weather, it's essential that all of us act responsibly while enjoying the outdoors so we can keep the number of wildfires at an absolute minimum.""
Stuart Gibson, a team leader with Galloway Mountain Rescue Team, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there are many reasons a wildfire can start.
He said: ""It can be people lighting campfires, it can be disposable barbeques, cigarettes - we would urge anyone going out into the hills to be really careful.""
Mr Gibson added that a dry winter and an ""exceptionally"" dry past couple of weeks meant there was a lot of dry deadwood, that could be set on fire quickly.
The BBC weather service found that the the south of Scotland had only recorded about 30%-50% of its expected rainfall for March.
SFRS guidance suggests taking care with glass bottles as well, as they can act like a magnifying glass when sunlight shines through them.
That can then focus heat and ignite dry materials nearby, causing a fire.
The combination of new growth and typically drier ground make spring a time with  conditions well-suited to fires starting.
Previous analysis by the fire service showed around two thirds of wildfires are accidental - the most common causes recorded were discarded cigarettes or unattended campfires.
The Scottish Wildfire Forum says the impact of wildfires on Scotland's natural environment can be ""devastating"".
Smoke from wildfires can reduce air quality, affecting the health of people living nearby,  while the wider environment can be hit by the loss of habitat or the loss of carbon storage and carbon emissions.
Environmental reesearch by the James Hutton Institute found that it can take many years for plants and vegetation to return their pre-fire state, particularly in areas with dry heath, like moorlands.
In addition, wildfires take up considerable resources from the fire service, with a knock-on effect on the time devoted to responding to incidents elsewhere.

Patrick Harvie warns of Green infighting and far right threat,"Patrick Harvie warns of ""dangerous forces"" of the far right in his final Scottish Greens conference speech as co-leader.",12 Apr 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewl2n95qeo,"Patrick Harvie has warned of the ""dangerous forces"" of the far right in his final Scottish Greens conference speech as co-leader.
He also hit out at infighting party members who share ""anonymous leaks, smears and insults"" as the Greens embark on a leadership contest.
Speaking in Stirling, Patrick Harvie said a ""small minority"" were underminining the work of fellow members and damaging the party and its reputation.
He urged delegates to build on the ""most impactful period in the party's history"" ahead of the next Holyrood election in 2026.
He told delegates: ""Green politics could hardly be more of a contrast with the rise of dangerous forces in today's political climate.
""The far right threat is very real, and too much of the political spectrum is still behaving as though it can be defeated by imitation.""
He also condemned ""so-called culture war agenda"" and ""the right wing's attempt to redefine free speech"".
The Glasgow MSP and former Scottish government minister announced last week that he would stand down in the summer.
Harvie, who was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2003, is the longest-serving party chief at Holyrood, having been in the role for almost 17 years.
Harvie said for much of the party's early history people voted Green ""as a protest"".
He said: ""That's not enough. It's not enough to win the chance to make change happen. It should never be enough to satisfy us.
""Green politics must be about making a difference in the real world, because the challenges, and crises, that we exist to face are far too urgent.""
Harvie, who intends to seek re-election as an MSP, said the party had built ""the capacity and the credibility to make change happen"" since the Scottish Parliament was founded in 1999.
He encouraged delegates to take Green politics forward and ""achieve more positive change in people's lives"".
In a speech following Harvie, Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater told delegates that action was needed to tax wealth and big polluters.
She said: ""The wealth of billionaires has more than tripled since 2010. They've made out like bandits in the last few years, cashing in every step of the way.
She added: ""We need to think beyond income tax, we need to tax wealth, we need to tax carbon emissions and the big polluters to put money back into people's pockets, back into public services and to build a fairer, greener country.""
Slater said Green policies would cut carbon emissions while putting money back in people's pockets.
She also paid tribute to her co-leader, who is a longtime fan of BBC sci-fi series Doctor Who.
She presented Harvie with a bottle of organic wine to mark his departure, topped with a pin badge of a Tardis in the style of Van Gough.
The Green conference is taking place relatively near Bannockburn, the site of the historical battlefield.
Cue analogies about powerful warriors gearing up for a Holyrood fight next spring - but that wouldn't quite fit the vibe of a Green conference. But - however you frame it - power and position does matter in politics - whether you're the Green co-leader Patrick Harvie or King Robert the Bruce.
On the face of it, perhaps hard to argue against a pretty successful political career for Harvie. MSP for 22 years, leader for 17, a key player in budget wrangling deals and part of the first pair of Greens ever to serve in government in the UK.
An ever-present media figure and a strong visual image means he's liked, disliked and - mostly importantly - recognised.
Harvie's valedictory speech turned over the highs and lows during his time in office. But now the challenge for the Greens - who can replace him? His colleague Lorna Slater has confirmed she will stand again for the co-leadership in the summer.
Harvie's towering presence in his party means a lid has almost been kept on infighting and power-play by some members. He hit out at that in his speech.
Membership grumbling did bubble over at the autumn conference in Greenock last year and now - as they seek to put their candidates up for the top job and also seek MSP positions themselves - that's getting worse.
There's another question - not just who leads but what's it all about? In an era of ""Drill, baby, drill"" and worries about costly eco projects in a downturn, the Green message is being challenged.
Couple that with a ramping up of the ""culture wars"", it's clear the Greens are not in ascendancy as they were - and certainly not in government.
So, the Greens are losing their king and when the successor steps up they and the co-leader will need to have their battle-field tactics well honed to achieve victories similar to Harvie."
Evacuations as wildfire spreads north through forest,"The fire service has deployed helicopters as part of efforts to extinguish the flames, while police have urged people to avoid the area.",6 Apr 2025,South Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jznpepyn6o,"People and properties have been evacuated as a wildfire has spread over a large area of forest in Galloway, in the south west of Scotland.
Emergency services were initially called to Glen Trool at about 23:50 on Friday, with police urging people to avoid the area.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said two crews remained on the scene Sunday afternoon, with helicopters continuing to water bomb the area. The Scottish government held a resilience meeting on Sunday evening.
Rising temperatures across the UK have led to wildfire warnings being put in place for several parts of the country.
Firefighters also tackled another wild blaze in the west Highlands near Ullapool.
Police closed a stretch of the A835 between the Achiltibuie junction and the junction at Badagyle.
A spokesperson for the SFRS said the fire in Galloway had now moved on to the nearby Lamachan Hill, but the blaze at Bennan Hill had been extinguished.
Police previously warned of a risk the flames could spread to the Loch Doon area of East Ayrshire after a change in wind direction.
People living in the area, including near Loch Doon, have been asked to keep windows and doors closed.
A helicopter was dispatched to assess damage to the area from above on Sunday morning.
Stewart Gibson, team leader at Galloway Mountain Rescue, said at one point fire crews had four helicopters dropping water on the flames from above, with the fire front ""two to three miles wide"" at one stage.
He said five groups of walkers were located on the hills on Friday night, but were safely moved away from the area.
Team members were acting as spotters for the police overnight on Sunday, but were stood down at about 04:00.
He urged anyone heading to the hills over the next week to take care and avoid lighting camp fires or naked flames.
Mr Gibson told BBC Radio's The Sunday Show: ""It's an exceptionally dry period of weather we have been having and I know for the next week it is going to be very dry as well.
""So anyone out with a camping stove, anything can spark the fire, so we would urge anyone out to take cares.
""We would advise people not to light camp fires and use naked flames.""
Police urged people to stay away from the site and urged and anyone camping nearby to leave. Areas affected include Merrick Hill, Ben Yellary and Loch Dee.
Another wildfire had been reported around the same the area on Thursday and covered some 1.5 miles (2.4km).
Scotland has seen a number of fires over the last few weeks as the weather gets warmer and drier.
The fire service issued an ""extreme"" warning for wildfires and the public has been urged to avoid lighting any fires outdoors until next week.
It warned that there was typically a large volume of ""dead, bone-dry vegetation across large areas of countryside"" at this time of year which acts as a fuel for fire.
The SFRS said hills are particularly prone to wildfires because the fire can spread far quicker uphill than on flatter ground.
BBC Scotland weather presenter, Christopher Blanchett, said the south of Scotland had only recorded about 30%-50% of its expected rainfall for March.
However, some areas close to the location of the fire at Glen Trool were drier still, with Scottish Environment Protection Agency rain gauge data showing rainfall at just 20% of expected levels.
He said: ""This part of the Galloway forest hasn't recorded any rainfall for more than a week, with the last wet weather here on 29 March.
""Overall, it's been a dry start to April in Scotland and this followed a very dry March. There's no rain forecast for the region for around another week too.
""In addition to the dry conditions, Friday and Saturday have been quite windy across the south west. On Friday night, the east-north-easterly winds were gusting close to gale force on the Solway coast.
He added: ""All of these factors combined can help fuel wildfires and allow them to spread"".
Meanwhile an amber alert for wildfires is in place for parts of England, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland until Monday.
A huge gorse fire spanning about two miles (3.2km) in the Mourne Mountains in County Down is being tackled by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service.
Police believe that fire may have been started deliberately.

"'Flower show has been my entire life, now it's gone'",Shrewsbury Flower Show began in 1875 but organisers said they could no longer continue due to costs.,17 Apr 2025,Shropshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98gd7l25l5o,"The community of Shrewsbury has reacted to the ""shock"" cancellation of one its most popular summer events, which has been running for 150 years.
Shrewsbury Flower Show, set up by the Shropshire Horticultural Society, began in 1875.
Known for its notable display of flowers and fireworks, the event has brought thousands of visitors to the Quarry park each year - but organisers announced on Wednesday that they can no longer continue to run it due to rising costs.
Margaret Thrower, a horticulturalist from Shrewsbury who has been involved with the flower show most of her life, said she is ""heartbroken"" as the show is ""her family"".
Ms Thrower, daughter of Percy Thrower, who became famous in the 1970s and 80s for his appearances on shows such as Gardeners' World and Blue Peter, and was parks superintendent for Shrewsbury, said she is lost for words over the news.
""It has been my life from the day I was born almost,"" she told BBC Radio Shropshire.
""When I think of the years of history, years of hard work that have gone in to producing that show.
""But not only that, the joy and entertainment it has brought to so many people and what it has brought to Shrewsbury, it is sad,"" she said.
""The show is me, it is a family. It has brought a lot to the town but it is an end of an era.
""I know the show was struggling but I never thought it would come to this.""
The show, which takes place over two days in mid-August, has been making a loss over recent years said Maelor Owen, chairman of Shropshire Horticultural Society.
Organisers cited ""changes to National Insurance (NI) and the minimum wage"", alongside the cost of living crisis as the reason behind the decision.
Mr Maelor, who joined the society in 2004, said: ""[For] people who have been with the society for a long time, it is safe to say people have looked at these things with their heart rather than their head.
""But if we continue the way we are then in the next 10 years we will be insolvent, it is no way to run any business or do anything.""
He said the 2024 show operated at a loss of £400,000, which led organisers to ""act quickly"" and make the decision.
Shrewsbury Town Council have said the news has come as a surprise as they were in discussions with organisers last week.
Helen Ball, town clerk of Shrewsbury Town Council, said: ""The Shrewsbury Flower Show is more than just a weekend event – it's part of who we are as a town.
""We understand the increasing pressures faced by event organisers in today's climate and sincerely thank the Shropshire Horticultural Society for their many years of dedication.
""We acknowledge the financial contribution the Horticultural Society made to the Quarry in 2000, which has left a lasting legacy for the town.
""We've always worked closely and positively with their team, and this announcement will come as a disappointment to many.""
The council added that the introduction of the Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill –  Martyn's Law – has introduced new and challenging responsibilities for event organisers, but said public safety must always remain paramount.
Mark Hooper, from Visit Shropshire, told BBC Radio Shropshire: ""When you say Shrewsbury people say 'flowers', so to lose something like this is terrible news, it is sad more than anything.""
Mr Hooper said the show is one of Shropshire's top five events of the year, bringing in a ""substantial"" amount of business for accommodation providers and the hospitality sector.
""It will be a big loss this year,"" he added.
""But Shrewsbury has got some great entrepreneurs, maybe someone else could take it on?""
The 2024 show featured more than 35 floral exhibitors and 175 traders - with expensive extra security measures added following a security threat at the 2023 event.
Ms Thrower, who lived in the park house in the Quarry as a young child, said she understands the society, which is a registered charity, cannot continue to make a loss but added the event has not changed with the times.
""It has got into a bit of a rut and just hasn't managed to get out of it,"" she said.
""Together people's aspirations and wants have changed over the years but the show hasn't changed with them.""
Mr Owen said the society will be looking at the event's long-term future, and those who have already bought tickets for the show can request refunds via the society's office.

Emergency water supply for at-risk canal costing £100k a week,"The charity operating the canal says it can't continue to shoulder the up to £100,000 a week costs.",4 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70z8rdw0lno,"A historic canal will be given an emergency water supply to stop it from running dry in days.
The Canal and River Trust, which runs the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, has used money which was earmarked for repairs to buy a short-term supply from Welsh Water.
But the charity said this was a ""stop gap"" and it could not continue ""to shoulder the full financial burden"" because, if recent dry weather continued, it could cost up to £100,000 a week to remedy.
Welsh Water said it was pleased the agreement did not incur costs for customers or risk drinking water.
Water will start being taken from the Usk Reservoir between Brecon and Llandovery from the early hours of Saturday.
The charity said the cost would vary depending on rainfall and therefore river levels,  but warned if current conditions persist, ""it's likely we'll be paying as much as £100,000 per week"".
It said it had diverted money away from planned maintenance and repairs to secure ""a stop gap water supply"".
It added this would have consequences for the its programme of maintenance and was therefore a ""risk"" for the England and Wales canal network.
The difficulties facing the canal were first outlined in a letter sent to local businesses by Glandŵr Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.
It explained the 225-year old canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries, which accounted for between 80% and 90% of its water supply.
Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, mean licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.
Now, the charity fears the dry start to 2025 means the canal could run start to run dry in days without imminent rainfall.
A petition in the Senedd, calling on the Welsh government to help preserve the canal, has obtained more than 10,000 signatures.
The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law, due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.
Environmentalists warned limits on the water taken from the Usk were needed so species and habitats had sufficient water to survive.
Mark Evans, director of Glandŵr Cymru, accepted this, but said, were the canal to dry out,  the effects on the historic structure and thriving ecology could be catastrophic, with jobs and tourism in south Wales irreparably impacted.
Richard Parry, the Canal and River Trust's chief executive, said it was not ""sustainable for a charity to shoulder the full financial burden of this new legislative requirement"".
""The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal has never before faced such restrictions to its water supply or had to pay for the water it needs to stay open for the public to enjoy and for the nature that depends upon it to thrive,"" he said.
""While this sticking plaster solution buys us some time, it is unfortunately short-term only. The pressure remains to urgently find a viable long-term solution for the canal.
""We will continue to call on the Welsh government to help secure a more sustainable future for this beautiful canal that brings so much to the area.""
The Welsh government previously said ""protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies"".
It added any arrangement between the canal and Welsh Water would be a commercial contractual decision in which it should not be involved.
Welsh Water said it was ""pleased to have come to an agreement to support the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal that covers the cost of providing the water and doesn't incur additional costs for our customers or put at risk the supply of drinking water over the summer"".
""We will continue to work closely with the Canal and Rivers Trust, Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Government on a longer-term solution that can support the canal beyond the coming year,"" it added."
"Green leadership contest 'wide open', says Slater","The Green co-leader dismissed claims of a Holyrood ""clique"" ahead of her party's spring conference.",11 Apr 2025,Scotland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ev55ewd8eo,"The Scottish Green leadership contest is ""wide open"", according to Lorna Slater.
The MSP, who has led the party along with Patrick Harvie since 2019, confirmed she will stand for re-election in this summer's ballot.
Harvie announced earlier this month he would stand down as co-leader in the summer after almost 17 years in the role.
Slater also rejected a claim from a former party official that a Green ""clique"" at Holyrood was ""viciously"" hoarding power away from members.
She spoke ahead of the party's spring conference in Stirling this weekend.
The Scottish Greens elect co-leaders every two years, with the winners of this year's contest expected to be announced in August.
Any member can stand as a candidate, though one of the co-chiefs has to be a woman.
Slater said she expected many members of the party to stand, including several MSPs.
""The field is really wide open,"" she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.
""I would invite all members to consider putting themselves forward. The more options for leadership, the better [for] democracy and the better debate we can have within the party.""
Tensions between grassroots Greens and senior party members have simmered for some time. Last year's conference was disrupted by a row about a vote on the government's plans for a National Care Service.
Glasgow councillor Dan Hutchison has called for the party to elect a councillor as one of the co-leaders.
He wrote in the Green Left Scotland blog: ""I want someone to lead us who sits with their community council every month and aren't swept up in the circus of Holyrood.""
The National reported in March that the co-chair of the party's executive, Jen Bell, resigned after seven months in the role.
She claimed there was a ""clique"" in the Green group at Holyrood who ""jealously, viciously, hoard their privilege from outsiders"".
Slater said she did not recognise that description.
She told the BBC the party's Holyrood group had ""worked really well together"" and did its ""absolute best"" to work with members.
""Of course, it is our members who drive not only policy, but things like deciding whether to go into the co-operation agreement with the Scottish government,"" the co-leader said.
""All of that comes from grassroots levels, and we always endeavour to make sure that it is our members that are at the front of everything.
""Which isn't to say we can't always improve.""
Meanwhile, Harvie said he was disappointed that Green members had criticised party politicians in briefings to the media.
He told the Daily Record: ""There is a very small number of people in the party who indulge in that kind of thing - frankly, insulting other party members and undermining their work.""
Slater served as a Scottish government minister for three years under a Green-SNP power-sharing agreement.
Her time in government came to an end a year ago this month, when former first minister Humza Yousaf ripped up the deal.
The co-leader insisted she was ""really proud"" of what the Greens achieved in government. She cited increases in the Scottish Child Payment, extra funding for nature restoration, a free bus travel scheme and the introduction of emergency rent controls.
While in government, Slater was criticised for overseeing the introduction of a beleaguered a bottle return deposit scheme.
Since the collapse of the power-sharing deal, SNP ministers have rowed back on key greenhouse gas emissions targets and flagship plans to make homeowners switch to greener heating soon after buying a new home.
""We were able to push the government so much further when we were in the room,"" Slater said.
""We work well with the SNP, even in opposition, we always aim to be constructive, and we're going to continue to push them.""
With a Holyrood election in May next year, Slater said Green conference would be an opportunity to promote ""a progressive party, pro-independence party"".
She described the Green as ""the one party in Scotland who is absolutely committed to tackling the climate crisis and to pushing back against that far right agenda that we see rising up all over the world""."
Welsh gin first in UK to get protected status,Dovey Native Botanical Gin is the first in the UK to be given the recognition.,8 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98g4y5807qo,"A gin made in Wales is the first in the UK to be given protected status.
Dovey Native Botanical Gin, produced by Dyfi Distillery at Corris, Gwynedd was granted geographical indication status (UKGI).
Pembrokeshire Native Oysters and Pembrokeshire Rock Oysters, as well Welsh Heather Honey, have also received protected status.
UKGI was set up to ensure certain UK foods and drinks could secure legal protection against imitation after the UK's withdrawal from the EU which runs its own scheme.
Pete and Danny Cameron produce Dovey Native Botanical Gin in the Dyfi Valley where theirs is currently the only distillery.
""The valley was designated by UNESCO as a World Biosphere Reserve several years ago and has a diversity of native flowers, fruits and wild herbs which is truly special... and we wanted to capture our surroundings in a bottle,"" said master distiller Pete.
Danny told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the two set out to make something that was ""mirrored to its landscape"".
""The foraged botanicals we use at the distillery all come from indigenous species,"" he said.
They sell to Michelin-starred restaurants, but also have people come to their visitor centre, where they can taste the gin and chat about its origins.
""We kind of exist in our own little bubble of demand,"" he said.
Dr Andy Woolmer of Tethys Oysters Ltd and Jake Davies of Atlantic Edge Shellfish Ltd are the partnership behind Pembrokeshire Native Oysters and Pembrokeshire Rock Oysters.
Dr Andy Woolmer said they were delighted with the news.
""It's a recognition of both the unique flavour of our oysters and the sustainable way in which we farm them,"" he said.
""PGI helps protect that identity, and we hope it encourages more chefs and food lovers to discover what makes Pembrokeshire oysters so special.""
Gruffydd Rees of Gwenyn Gruffydd Ltd, behind Welsh Heather Honey, in Carmarthenshire said he was delighted that Wales was the first UK nation to have a honey receive PGI status.
Huw Irranca-Davies, Wales' Deputy First Minister, who also has responsibility for Climate Change and Rural Affairs, said the recognition ""strengthens Wales' growing family of protected foods""
""From the mountains to the coast, Wales produces some of the UK's most iconic foods, cultivated with care and tradition.
""Each GI product tells the story of our landscape, our producers' expertise and our proud culinary heritage,"" he said."
Farmers 'will take whatever rain we get',"Many crops are ""stressed"" after the sunniest April on record, but apples are more resilient.",2 days ago,Northamptonshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev49zkpv04o,"Farmers say they ""desperately"" need wet weather after the sunniest April on record.
One farmer from Northamptonshire said he would take whatever rain he could get as both his arable crops and his fodder grass were gasping for water.
Many farms suffered a bad harvest last year because of the relatively high rainfall, and are now facing the same pressure thanks to the sun.
A cider maker in the county said the warm weather was making his apples sweeter and making alcohol levels ""a bit higher"".
The Met Office said provisional figures showed 2025 had had the sunniest April since records began in 1910.
There were 47% more sunshine hours than the long-term meteorological average.
At Pear Tree Farm in Aldwincle near Thrapston in Northamptonshire, Tim Hankins was celebrating a small downpour on Sunday night.
""We'll take whatever we can get. We desperately, desperately need wet weather,"" he said.
""April showers - where were they?""
A thunderstorm warning has been issued for parts of the East of England for Monday afternoon until 22:00 BST, including Northants.
He added that he needed rain not just for his arable crops but also for the grass he grows to feed his sheep and cattle.
He said his barley and wheat were ""very stressed - a bit like I am"".
""It's going a bit yellow. We've put some fertiliser on 10 days ago and I should imagine today will be the first day it actually gets into the soil,"" he said.
""We had a bad harvest last year because of all the wet weather, and now we're heading for a bad harvest again with the dry weather - unless we get some rain now.""
At Overstone Grange Farm a few miles from Northampton, Tom Harris reported his fields were ""just cake and dust which you wouldn't ordinarily expect this time of year"".
""We're at the mercy of the weather unless your farm's set up for irrigation, which, in this part of the world, not many farms are,"" he said.
""All you can do is hope the weather comes good for you.""
He has diversified into growing a plant that should like the sunshine - sunflowers.
""They love the sun and turn their heads turn towards it, but they went in the ground last week and they need moisture to get a bit of a start,"" he said.
At Saxby's Cider in Farndish near Wellingborough, the fruit Phil Saxby and the team rely on is not quite as dependant on good weather.
He said apples had ""got deep roots and there's moisture further down so there's not so much of a panic"".
""If you have a very dry year, we find that the apples generally are a little bit smaller and they're a little bit sweeter so there's a little bit more sugar in there so the alcohol levels are generally a bit higher,"" he said.

You can't please everybody - Man Utd boss Skinner,"Manager Marc Skinner accepts he is ""not going to please everybody"" in the Manchester United fanbase.",11 Apr 2025,Women's Football,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77nnpr4x0xo,"This video can not be played
Resilience the key to being longest-serving manager in WSL - Skinner
Marc Skinner accepts he is ""not going to please everybody"" in the Manchester United fanbase after a mixed reaction to the announcement of his new contract.
Manager Skinner, 42, recently signed a two-year extension until June 2027, with the option of an extra 12 months.
United sit third in the Women's Super League with the best defensive record in the division.
They have also reached the Women's FA Cup semi-finals, where they play local rivals Manchester City on Sunday.
Asked if he has silenced his critics this season, Skinner told BBC Sport: ""I don't ever think of it that way. I genuinely respect everybody and their opinion.""
But knowing some supporters would like to see him replaced is an uncomfortable truth.
""It's not nice to hear, of course not,"" Skinner said. ""I am human. My energy is always to my team and for the fans, it's not to try and prove people wrong.""
Skinner is the longest-serving current manager in the WSL, having taken charge in 2021.
After guiding United to a fourth-place finish in his first campaign, they then finished second in the WSL to secure a place in the Champions League for the first time.
Skinner then led the team to their first major honour by winning the FA Cup last year.
He feels his team are on an upward trajectory and wants to drive them on, regardless of whether his work is rated by some sections of the fanbase.
""I respect them, I respect their points of view, but I am still going to do my job to the best of my ability and try to make people better every day,"" Skinner said.
""They want their team to win and if I can deliver that for them, it doesn't matter if they like what I do or not.
""I've been really proud of what the team are doing this year and I want to make sure for the fans and for the whole club that I am the figurehead that pushes us towards continued success and builds a team that can be solid for many years to come.""
Women's FA Cup semi-final: Man City v Man Utd
Sunday, 13 April at 15:00 BST
United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said last year the men's team was the ""main issue"" and referred to the women's side as ""girls"" and ""an opportunity"".
He has since spoken to BBC Sport at length on a range of topics, including his previous comments on the women's team.
Ratcliffe said it was ""unfair"" to suggest he did not care about the women, but added that his business background meant ""you tend to focus on the bigger issues before you focus on the smaller issues"".
After signing up to stay, Skinner told BBC Sport he has a ""burning ambition"" to achieve continued success and feels he can do so under the current ownership.
As for whether he feels he has the backing of Ineos to fulfil those ambitions, Skinner said: ""I do. I feel that for other reasons other than just financial support.
""We have been very clear that we are trying to build a sustainable model rather than throw money at a problem. We are trying to do it in a way that grows over a period of years, which I think is sensible in the current climate.
""Everybody would like the quick fix, but for us there is something better about growing over a period of time that is organic, that works, that feels as it moves.""
While United lost key figures including Mary Earps, captain Katie Zelem and Nikita Parris last summer, they have had an impressive campaign without finding big-money replacements.
""In the meantime we have to find other solutions,"" Skinner said. ""We have to add experience to the group should we qualify for the Champions League.
""Should we look to win leagues and should we look to continue to have success in the cups, we have to invest of course. That is on the plan and that is a strategy.
""Because I know what the end prize is, I am willing to push as hard as I possibly can to work with that continued growth.""

Aid agency donates 300k to Myanmar relief efforts,Jersey Overseas Aid has given emergency funds to help relief in Myanmar after the earthquake.,7 Apr 2025,Jersey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62jxre03k2o,"A Jersey aid agency has donated £300,000 to relief work in Myanmar after the earthquake which has left at least 3,000 dead.
Jersey Overseas Aid has given the money to British Red Cross, Age International, and People in Need.
The agency is providing emergency aid and healthcare and helping older people affected by the 7.7 magnitude earthquake in March.
Edward Lewis, executive director of Jersey Overseas Aid, said: ""The widespread devastation we are witnessing in Myanmar comes amid an already dire humanitarian situation where almost 20 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.""
Mr Lewis added: ""Widespread damage to roads, bridges, hospitals, and utilities is hindering rescue and relief efforts with a significant number of the population left without access to basic services.
""The earthquake has compounded existing needs for millions severely impacted by longstanding localised conflicts, political and economic instability and exposure to frequent climate shocks.""
The money has been split equally between the three charities.

Wrexham criticised for flying to away match,"Over two days, the plane travelled almost 1,200 miles to take the Wrexham team to Wycombe.",1 Apr 2025,Wales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7v1z45d8o,"Wrexham AFC have come under fire after using a private jet to fly to and from a League One away game against promotion rivals Wycombe Wanderers.
The plane, chartered from Jersey, travelled a total of 1,178 miles (1,896km) to take them on a 37-minute flight instead of a three-hour coach journey for the match on 15 March.
In the same month, the club's co-owner, actor Ryan Reynolds, pledged to the United Nations to ""engage with and advocate"" for sustainable goals aimed at making the sport more environmentally friendly.
Wrexham have been approached for comment.
The team were only on the plane for about 250 miles out of the almost 1,200-mile total trip, with the flight taking them from Hawarden Airport in Flintshire to Oxford.
The jet flew from Jersey to Hawarden to pick the team up on 14 March, before flying to Oxford and returning to Jersey.
It did the return journey the following day.
Wrexham won the match 1-0 and are currently three points ahead of their promotion rivals, having played a game more.
Wrexham took 16 flights domestic flights in their promotion season from the National League two years ago.
Meanwhile, research from 2023 found Premier League clubs took 81 flights out of 100 games in a two-month period, with the shortest being 27 minutes.
In striker Paul Mullin's book, My Wrexham Story, he said flights became a regular occurrence after a royal visit to the Racecourse Ground left the team facing a five-hour coach journey close to kick off time.
He said co-owner Rob McElhenney said the team could fly to all away matches more than two hours away by road.
Of Wrexham's 23 League One opponents, only eight are within a two-hour drive.
Criticism of the decision to fly to the match at Wycombe was posted on TikTok by campaign group Fossil Free Football, who said the club would have spent more than an hour on the road in trips to and from airports.
Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming when released into the atmosphere.
In 2023, private flights produced an estimated 15.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide - the equivalent of 3.7 million petrol cars being driven over the course of a year, - according to research.
Fossil Free Football said: ""No-one want this problem to get worse at any level, from grassroots where 120,000 matches a season are already cancelled, to professional football where we saw things like Wimbledon pitch collapsing after a heavy storm last year.""
The video also called Reynolds hypocritical for visiting the UN in New York to join Football for the Goals, a UN initiative aimed at making the sport more sustainable."
Wildlife surveys begin on onshore wind farm plans,Ecological surveys in Earystane and Scard are set to grow understanding of local wildlife behaviour.,7 Apr 2025,Isle of Man,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grmny4z9mo,"Ecological surveys are expected to begin later as part of ongoing research into an onshore wind farm in the south of the Isle of Man.
Manx Utilities (MU) has employed consultants Wardell Armstrong SLR to carry out several studies into the local wildlife in Earystane and Scard.
The project, called Cair Vie, would see five turbines built in the area, which could deliver up to 130 gigawatts of energy per year.
Ecologists and surveyors will be conducting studies over the coming months focusing on bats, birds, frogs, long-eared owls, and raptors.
MU said the work was being carried out to ""better understand the seasonal local wildlife and habitats to ensure that the wind farm project is carried out responsibility"".
Throughout April, May and June, surveys will include monitoring and tracking bat activities and movements in different locations.
The breeding and flight patterns of local bird species, including hen harriers, are to be monitored as part of the research.
MU said surveyors would stand at viewpoints to observe how birds fly in the area to assess any risks wind turbines could pose.
Water samples are also to be taken to see if there are frogs in the area.
Studies planned for June include observing the breeding and travelling behaviours of hen harriers and raptors.
Ecologists will also ""use thermal cameras and listen for territorial male owl calls at dusk to detect breeding owls in the area"", MU said.
The studies were ""observation only"" and would be ""minimally invasive"", it added, saying that the findings would be used ""to guide the project and minimise any impact on nature"".
The wind farm scheme, expected to cost £36m, is part of the government's commitment to decarbonise the island's electricity supply by 2030.

Chance of asteroid hitting Moon increases slightly,Asteroid 2024 YR4 won’t hit Earth but now has a 3.8% chance of striking the Moon.,4 Apr 2025,Science & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdznz83x8vo,"A large asteroid whose chances of hitting Earth have been all but ruled out is now slightly more likely to hit the Moon than previously thought, Nasa says.
When first discovered, asteroid 2024 YR4 had a very small chance of impacting Earth in 2032 but the US space agency has cut that chance to 0.004%.
It has now reported though, that the likelihood of a Moon impact on 22 December, 2032, has more than doubled from 1.7% to 3.8%. It based the recalculation on information from telescopes including the James Webb Space Telescope.
""There is still a 96.2% chance that the asteroid will miss the Moon,"" Nasa said in a statement, noting that even if it did make impact, it wouldn't change the Moon's orbit.
Webb's infrared observations also helped to narrow the estimate of the asteroid's size to be between 53-67 meters - about the size of a 10-storey building.
In the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile in December, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon.
It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.

The moon's surface is littered with craters where asteroids and comets have impacted in the past.
A new lunar impact, although extremely unlikely, could offer a rare chance to observe a real collision and study how the Moon responds.
Professor Mark Burchell, Professor of Space Science at the University of Kent, told the New Scientist magazine that a Moon hit would be ""a great experiment and a perfect opportunity"".
""Telescopes would certainly see it, and binoculars might,"" he added.
Webb will observe the asteroid again next month for further analysis."
Woman who hired 'man with van' on Facebook fined £2k,Simone Jackson found someone on social media to remove her rubbish but it was later found dumped.,9 Apr 2025,Manchester,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y40eexjd3o,"A woman who used a ""man with a van"" she found on social media to get rid of rubbish has been ordered to pay £1,900.
Simone Jackson, 38, of Broad Oak Lane, Bury, found someone on Facebook to remove waste which was later found dumped in nearby Lowes Road.
The council later identified her as the source of the waste and gave her a fixed penalty notice of £400. However, the authority said she did not pay it.
She was found guilty at Manchester Magistrates' Court of failing to comply with the householder's duty of care in the disposal of household waste and fined £500 and ordered to pay a £250 victim surcharge and £1,150 costs, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Councillor Alan Quinn, Bury's cabinet member for the environment, climate change and operations, said: ""People are sick to death of fly-tipping.
""It's a blot on the landscape, and costs council tax payers money to have it cleared up.""
Since June 2021, the council has issued 224 fixed penalties for fly-tipping and littering and had 18 successful prosecutions for environmental crime.
Quinn added that there had been a noticeable increase in advertisements on social media for unlicensed waste removal services.
""Every individual and business has a duty of care to ensure they correctly dispose of their waste,"" he said.
""Many unsuspecting householders are being caught out by these rogue traders, drawn by their attractive low rates compared to legitimate operators.
""I urge residents to check their credentials before using them and remind the public that officers now have the power to issue £400 fixed penalty notices on householders who fail in their duty of care.""
The council said residents should ask any waste carrier for their address and telephone number, their waste carrier licence, and ask where their waste will be taken to.
He said an instant and free check of waste carrier's credentials can be made via the Environment Agency.
There are 21 recycling centres in Greater Manchester where residents can take their waste for disposal free of charge.

"Francis was a vocal critic of the powerful, his influence felt far beyond faith","The informal Pope aimed to shift influence from Rome into hands of the faithful, the BBC's Aleem Maqbool writes.",21 Apr 2025,BBC InDepth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15v0zdnnjqo,"Over 12 profoundly consequential years for the Catholic Church, Pope Francis steered it into uncharted territory and did so in ways that will resonate long into the future.
The pontiff worked to soften the face of the Catholic Church for many, loosened the Vatican's grip on power and intervened in some of the major social questions of our time.
Within Catholicism, he certainly had his critics; some traditionalists in particular were often enraged by actions they felt were a radical departure from Church teaching.
Despite him being a vocal pacifist and critic of actions by major nations that he perceived as harmful, there were also those who felt he should have been more progressive.
But from the moment he was elected in 2013, Pope Francis came with an informality and a smile that put the people he met at their ease. It was symbolic of a principle that guided his belief that the Church should reach people in their daily lives, wherever in the world they happened to be.
""At the beginning of my papacy I had the feeling that it would be brief: no more than three or four years, I thought,"" Pope Francis said in his autobiography Hope, released in January 2025, a book that gives us insight into the Pope's own reflections on his legacy.
One of his first acts as pope was to give up the papal apartment on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, instead choosing to live in the same guesthouse in which he had stayed as a cardinal.
Some saw this as a sign he was giving up the ostentatious trappings of papacy, and of the humility he would certainly become known for - he had, after all, taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the poor.
But the main reason for surrendering the papal apartment, as he later explained it, pointed to another of his characteristics: that he loved being around people.
To him, the apartment felt detached and a difficult place in which to welcome guests. At the guesthouse he was surrounded by clergy and rarely alone for long.
On foreign trips to more than 60 countries, in his audiences at the Vatican and during countless events, it was very clear that being close to people, and particularly the young, was his lifeblood.
Within Catholicism, he signalled a radical change in tone on some social issues.
""Everyone in the Church is invited, including people who are divorced, including people who are homosexual, including people who are transgender,"" he wrote in his autobiography.
Given that the Church did not recognise divorce in its canon law and that previous popes had talked of homosexuality as a disorder not ""a human fact"", as Pope Francis did, this was a departure that again concerned traditionalists.
But the Pope appeared to want the Church to explore and understand people's every day struggles in a fresh light. He acknowledged his own journey in seeing things differently to the way he had done in the past.
Progressives welcomed the Pope's compassion for what he called ""imperfect Catholics"", but there was also a recognition more broadly that words of acceptance from a pontiff could have an effect on those outside the Church too.
""The first time that a group of transgender people came to the Vatican, they left in tears, moved because I had taken their hands, had kissed them... as if I had done something exceptional for them! But they are daughters of God,"" he wrote in Hope.
Pope Francis roundly condemned countries that consider homosexuality a crime, and he talked of divorce sometimes being ""morally necessary"", citing cases of domestic abuse.
However, there are those who suggest the Pope could have gone further to encourage change in Church teaching.
Homosexual ""acts"" remain a sin in Catholicism, marriage can still only be between a man and a woman, divorce is still not officially recognised and the Pope himself remained very firmly against gender reassignment and surrogacy.
Throughout his papacy, and long before that, Pope Francis also always remained firm in his own belief that women should not be priests.
He did however describe the Church as ""female"" and encouraged parishes around the world to find more leadership roles for women in ways that were consistent with the Catholic teaching that does not currently allow women to be ordained.
In 2021 Sister Raffaella Petrini was appointed secretary general of the papal state and under Pope Francis the Vatican did start an ongoing process of exploring whether women could take up the role of deacon, assisting in worship services.
Nevertheless, some reformists were left disappointed that more progress was not made regarding equality for women, in a faith where the majority of churchgoers are women.
During the latter part of his papacy, the Pope launched an ambitious three-year consultation process aimed at gauging the opinion of as many of the world's more-than-a-billion Catholics as possible.
There were tens of thousands of listening sessions across the globe, meant to tease out the issues that Catholics most cared about. It transpired that roles for women and ways in which the Church could become more inclusive to LGBT+ Catholics were high on the list.
While the process itself did not lead to decisive action on either front, it did speak volumes about Pope Francis' desire that his pontificate was rooted not in Rome and in clerics but in the lives of believers around the world.
Throughout his papacy, there was a particular focus on reaching out to those on the economic and political margins, his words and actions encouraging his priests to be closer to the disadvantaged.
The issue of dignity for migrants was hugely important to him throughout his papacy, but so too was building bridges with other Christian denominations, other religions and those of no faith.
On occasions, to some Catholic traditionalists, the Pope's outreach appeared inappropriate for someone of his position, like his visit to a centre for asylum seekers outside Rome in spring 2016 when he washed and kissed the feet of refugees that included Muslims, Hindus and Coptic Christians.
As well as becoming a passionate voice for migrants - once going to lay a wreath on the waters where many had died on their perilous journeys - he also linked the impact of climate change to poverty.
In speeches, including one to US Congress, and in one of his most important pieces of work, the decree Laudato Si, Pope Francis talked of environmental damage amounting to rich countries inflicting harm on poor ones.
Vehemently anti-war, the Pope frequently talked of conflict itself equating to failure.
He called the war in Gaza ""terrorism"" and from early on he implored that there be a ceasefire.
He met the families of the Israelis abducted by Hamas on 7 October 2023, but also spoke passionately about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, particularly children, and made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza City.
But sometimes a longing to build bridges was seen by some observers as getting in the way of Pope Francis taking a firm stance against wrongdoing.
In the eyes of many, he failed to unequivocally call out Russian aggression in Ukraine or tackle China's surveillance and persecution of its Catholics.
From the very start of his papacy, he also faced huge tasks confronting misconduct much closer to home.
The scourge of corruption had long dogged the upper echelons of the Catholic Church. Early on, Pope Francis closed thousands of unauthorised Vatican bank accounts, and in the latter half of his time he introduced new rules on financial transparency.
It was in the way he dealt with the horrors of child sexual abuse by those associated with the Catholic Church that made it clear he knew it was something he would be judged by.
""From the very start of my papacy, I felt I was being called to take responsibility for all the evil committed by certain priests,"" he wrote in Hope.
As an illustration of the scale of the problem that remains, in 2020 the Catholic Church released lists of living members of clergy in the US alone found to have been accused of sexual abuses - these included clergy linked to child pornography and rape. There were around 2,000.
""With shame and repentance, the Church must seek pardon for the terrible damage that those clergy have caused with their sexual abuse of children, a crime that causes deep wounds of pain,"" he recently wrote.
Among other initiatives, Pope Francis introduced rules that meant members of the Church had a responsibility to report on abuse if they had knowledge of it, otherwise they risked being removed from their positions.
Though he made errors of judgement, on occasions publicly supporting clergy even though they were alleged to have failed to deal with abuse, Pope Francis was quick to apologise for his own mistakes and for the deep failings of the Church.
Both at the Vatican and abroad he would frequently meet with Church abuse victims. Saying ""sorry"" for abuse was the prime focus of some foreign trips.
A huge part of Pope Francis' legacy is the way in which he changed the face of the upper echelons of the Catholic Church through his selection of new cardinals.
In fact, about 80% of the cardinals that will select the next pope were appointed by Pope Francis. What is striking about those selections is their diversity, with many coming from South America, Africa and Asia.
It was part of Pope Francis' mission to consolidate a change in the centre of gravity of Catholicism away from Europe, where it was in decline, towards the places it was thriving, and to reflect that in Church leadership.
The posthumous outpouring of tributes to him from across the globe is perhaps one sign that shift is working.

Tourist attraction shut nearly as often as open,"The Islandmagee tourist attraction has been closed by rockfalls, storm damage and planned works.",13 Apr 2025,Northern Ireland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34y59ywgxo,"A Northern Ireland tourist attraction which has received millions of pounds for repairs and maintenance has been closed nearly as many days as it has been open in the past decade.
The Gobbins Cliff Path in Islandmagee, County Antrim reopened to the public in 2015.
Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has spent about £4.3m since 2017 on repairs to the path, which has faced prolonged closures due to rockfalls, storm damage, planned works and inspections.
A council spokesperson said the attraction is ""projected to break even"" within five years of of a planned major revamp, which will mark ""an important milestone in its long-term sustainability"".
The Gobbins first opened in 1902, designed by the engineer Berkeley Deane Wise.
The cliff walk, made up of a series of bridges, paths and tunnels, had fallen into disrepair by the 1950s but a £7.5m investment saw it open again in 2015.
Since 2015 the attraction has been shut for a combined 1,624 days, or about 46% of the time, according to figures released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act.
The longest closure was for over a year from 19 June 2016 until 30 June 2017.
A Scottish based company that offers tours of Northern Ireland said while they promote the Gobbins on their website, they haven't included it on tours due to its ""unreliable"" opening.
Heather Rennie-McGill, director of marketing and sales at Rabbie's, said the Gobbins has ""real potential"" as a ""unique attraction"".
""If we're selling tours six to 12 months out for customers, and something like this would be a key highlight because the tour lasts two-and-a-half to three hours which is a big chunk of a day, we'd need reliability,"" she said.
""We can't include things in our itineraries where it would be taken out at the last minute.""
The path is currently closed due to a recent rockfall, the cost of repairs for which is not known.
Mid and East Antrim Council have said they are not able to provide figures on spending on the path before 2017.
The BBC has previously reported that essential maintenance costing £400,000 was carried out to fix the access path after damage caused by Storm Frank in 2015, with an additional £1.6m allocated for scaling works ahead of the 2017 season.
This suggests that at least £5.6m has been spent to maintain the tourist attraction since it reopened.
Mother and daughter Isabella and Léa Petit Boyer had hoped to visit the path during a week-long trip to Northern Ireland but were disappointed.
""It's a shame that we can't see this cliff,"" Léa said.
""We first wanted to do the Gobbins Cliff Path because first of all the coast is really wonderful, [and] it's a great tourist attraction.""
Stephen Weir, an Islandmagee resident said he and his wife had hoped to visit the path for his 60th birthday but couldn't due to it being closed.
""It seems to be a regular occurrence,"" he said.
""Hopefully it will be open and we'll get to do it later on in year but you'd think coming in to the summer season... now would be the time that it would be open.""
Stephen also questioned the economic viability of the site.
""In theory it's a brilliant idea to get round there and see the birds and all that in their natural habitat but I mean especially in the current economic climate, I mean do we really need to spend all that money if it's not working?""
Stephen Henry, who also lives in the borough, said he thinks the path is a ""waste of money"".
""The rates are paying for it and it's for a service that's never open.""
He said that he had been to do the tour on a previous occasion when it was open.
""It's nice to look at, there's no doubt about it.
""But is it value for money? Probably not.""
Last year, Mid and East Antrim Borough Council announced an investment in the Gobbins of £13.5m, with £12.6 million coming from the Belfast Region City Deal.
The plans include a new 60m-high staircase, a rope bridge and new cliff-top welcome hub.
The current visitor centre is located a five minute drive from the path, with tours accessing the path via a shuttle bus service from the centre.
The spending also includes plans to create a new virtual reality offering at the existing visitor centre for those who cannot access the path.
A council spokesperson said that, once completed, ""the Phase II development is expected to deliver substantial economic and tourism benefits, including 245,000 cliff path visitor numbers annually, driving substantial growth in the local economy""."
The 'freakosystem' accidentally created on Hawaii,Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.,4 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250403-the-new-hawaiian-freakosystem-emerging-on-oahu-accidentally-created-by-humans,"Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.
Venture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.
""It's beautiful,"" says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the ""cheww-chewww"" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. ""There's really neat lizards around,"" adds Tarwater. ""There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species.""
For hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. ""You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there.""
O'ahu's lowland forests are now almost entirely devoid of the plants and animals that grew here for millions of years before the arrival of humans. Settlers brought extinctions by cutting down trees to make farms and introducing voracious predators and disease-carrying animals. Today, these tropical forests are a tapestry of non-native species introduced from every corner of the planet: Brazilian peppertree, Indonesian cinnamon and roseleaf bramble from the Himalayas and Australia. Most of the animals, including all the birds that Tarwater mentioned earlier, are also alien.
O'ahu's mountainous terrain – a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films – is shaped ""at every level"" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured native bird species that exist nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose native range spans from India to Southern China.
""I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised – guava, a plant native to Brazil,"" he says. ""That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island.""
Most of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random – some are escaped pets, others relics from abandoned farms. Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.
Birds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. In a 2019 study, Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.
""If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?"" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. ""To our surprise, the answer was yes.""
For the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of ""emerging"" or ""novel ecosystems"" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as ""autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities"", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.
Humans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by reshaping the landscape or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has documented how a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.
In Brazil, rainforests cleared for farming have later become freshwater floodplains, known as várzeas, which are home to a new mix of species. Similarly, retired quarries can fill with water to become deep lakes, and even mines have become valued habitats.
One former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that harbours rare plants such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.
Unlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. ""These are wild but changed ecosystems,"" he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. ""If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward,"" he says.
So how much of the planet is already covered by novel ecosystems like these? Some analyses have arrived at startling figures – in a 2013 book on novel ecosystems, researchers argued that 30-40% of the world's terrestrial ecosystems have already transformed into novel states. A study by Svenning projected that half of the land on the planet would be novel by 2100.
However, these figures – like much around ""novel ecosystems"" – remain highly controversial among ecologists. Critics argue that scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are ""kind of borderline"", says Svenning. For example, power plants in Florida and Japan are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.
""They don't depend on direct active management,"" like zoos, Svenning says. ""But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?""
For the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an ""amazing crystal ball"" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.
For millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks erupting from volcanoes between 30 million and 500,000 years ago, plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.
Hawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from ""flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls"", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book Understanding Imperiled Earth. Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or ""flightless megaducks"", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.
Of the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the ""extinction capital of the world"".
Hawaii's islands are a ""microcosm"" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to 2020 research led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans – first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 – resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can kill native birds with a single bite.
""We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands,"" says Tarwater. ""It's what you don't want to have happen.""
Unsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. ""When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the [non-native] birds,"" says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.
""It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems,"" says Tarwater. Still, it's a ""double-edged sword"", she says. ""Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants,"" she says – which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.
During a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In a 2020 paper, Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded – some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.
For the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them ""freakosystems"", he says. Since these strange places began to gain recognition in the late 1990s, the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.
Invasive species
Deliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
Globally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth $423bn (£323bn) per year.
Restoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point – often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.
But in many places – including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far – turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of ""practical unrestorability"" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.
Faced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native ""invasive"" species – typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.
Take, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or ""burros"" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have resorted to large-scale culls.
But research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes – known as wells or ""ass holes"" – in many cases providing the only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed eating donkeys.
Meanwhile in Australia, introduced megafauna – from feral horses and donkeys to camels and water buffalo – often make drylands more functionally similar to the ancient past, when 200kg (440lb) giant wombats dug holes in the country's interior, Svenning's research has shown.
Yet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive black rats or cane toads, novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have driven conservation for decades. In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics responded that she was giving permission to ""trash nature"". Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become a much-loved park in San Francisco, says Higgs.
As climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have ""novel elements"" or degrees of ""ecological novelty"". A new map published by researchers in March 2025, tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: ""This extended out to protected areas,"" he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.
Responding to these findings, ecologist Anna Walentowitz at the University of Bayreuth in Germany wrote that ecological novelty is now the ""new normal"" for our planet, forcing us to question how we protect nature today.
O'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.
""For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds,"" he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.
On O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction by meticulously removing invasive plant species from ""these tiny restoration sites"", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones, she says. ""There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good [for native plants], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits.""
More like this:
• The ancient forest that supports Venice
• Hawaii's ancient land management system
• The race to protect Pacific whales
To get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They use speakers to play the calls of ""birds that we know are really good seed dispersers"" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. ""Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it."" (Read about how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too.)
Such strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants – although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.
It all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. ""It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration,"" says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. ""But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that [non-native plant] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon.""
While novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.
""We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad.""

North of Scotland electricity network to have £450m upgrade,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said the work would create at least 300 skilled jobs.,7 Apr 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1me5mj12vdo,"The electricity network in the north of Scotland will be improved with a £450m investment by the end of the decade, an energy firm has announced.
Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said the work would create at least 300 skilled jobs.
SSEN also said it would make existing supplies ""more resilient"" and support decarbonisation of communities and industry by connecting solar panels and heat pumps to the network.
The areas covered include Dundee,  Aberdeen, the Highlands and all of Scotland's islands.
The investment will see the existing network of wooden poles and overhead lines upgraded, substations updated, and improvements to the underground network.
Fraser Wilson of SSEN said the investment would offer a ""real refresh"".
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We will be making it more reliable, replacing equipment that's already there, giving it more capacity, so when people want to connect to the network the power for them will be there.
""The whole system at distribution level, which is what goes into homes and businesses, will be refurbished and refreshed.""
SSEN said the investment would tackle climate change by helping homes move away from fossil fuels, by connecting EVs and heat pumps to the system.
Mr Wilson added the upgrade programme could require roadworks or temporary interruptions to power supply.
Five companies - OCU Utility Services Ltd, Clancy Ltd, Freedom Group Ltd, Macaulay Askernish Ltd and Brush Group - will be contract partners for the investment.
Fraser Hood,  SSEN's director of large capital delivery, said this would ""reduce supply chain risks and secure specialist skills.""
Gillian Martin, the Scottish government's energy secretary, said the investment would ""bring benefits for our workforce, our supply chains, and our regional and national economies"".
She added: ""Decarbonising Scotland's economy depends heavily on significant investment in the upkeep and futureproofing of our electricity system, so the network can meet the demand from users now and in the future."""
Deep coal mine plans officially dropped,Plans for the first deep coal mine in the UK in more than 30 years are officially abandoned.,4 Apr 2025,Cumbria,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0ynqqzezvo,"Plans for the UK's first deep coal mine in more than 30 years have officially been abandoned.
Planning permission for the mine at Whitehaven, Cumbria, was overturned by the High Court last year following a campaign by environmental groups.
Developer West Cumbria Mining (WCM) was then given a deadline by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) to decide whether it wanted to continue its planning permission application.
WCM has now dropped these plans, MHCLG said. The developer has been approached for comment.
The mine was initially approved by the then-government in 2022, but Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Action on Climate Change argued the environmental impact of burning extracted coal had not been taken into account.
At the High Court last September, Mr Justice Holgate described the government's assumption that the mine would not produce a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions, or would be a net zero mine, as ""legally flawed"".
WCM said at the time it would ""consider the implications"" of the judgement before commenting further.
Campaigners had been calling for the firm to ""break its silence"".
As it is legally obliged to do, the government began the process for reassessing the application earlier this year and wrote to all interested parties asking for their views.
Friends of the Earth said it met a 27 February deadline to submit its reply but that WCM had ""failed to respond"".
The mining firm was then given a new deadline of 26 March to respond.
MHCLG has now confirmed that the mining company withdrew its planning application for the site on 31 March.
It added the government ""will have no further role in this case"".
Friends of the Earth activist Tony Bosworth said the group was ""delighted"" by the news.
""Congratulations to all the brilliant local campaigners who fought so powerfully to stop this mine,"" he said.
""The focus must now switch to ensuring local people get the green jobs they so urgently need - areas like West Cumbria have been left behind for far too long.""

Rewilding charity angry at delay to beaver project,NatureScot says they have delayed granting a licence due to concerns in the local community,2 Apr 2025,Highlands & Islands,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqrxr72xgvo,"A rewilding charity says it is ""mystified"" its plan to release beavers in a Highland glen have been delayed.
Moray-based Trees for Life has been working with Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) on the Glen Affric proposal for the past two years.
Scotland's nature body NatureScot said it had delayed granting a licence for the reintroduction due to ""considerable concern"" in the local community.
Trees for Life chief executive Steve Micklewright said: ""This is an astonishing move by NatureScot.""
The glen is a large area of thickly wooded hillsides and glens with a river, streams and lochs south of Inverness.
It includes fragments of ancient Caledonian Forest.
Legal releases of beavers have already taken place in Knapdale in Argyll and parts of the Cairngorms National Park in the Highlands.
FLS applied for a licence in January for the release of beavers at Loch Beinn a Mheadhoin this spring.
NatureScot said it had decided to delay due to concerns among farmers, crofters and fisheries organisations.
It said further consultation would be held on the plan.
Chris Donald, NatureScot's head of operations for Central Highland, said: ""We recognise the significant efforts that have been made by FLS, Trees for Life and partners to consult with local communities and stakeholders.
""It is clear, however, that there remains considerable concern about the proposal among the local community and its representatives.""

Trees for Life's Mr Micklewright said: ""After two years of exhaustive consultations that far exceeded the requirements set out by NatureScot and that they have described as exemplary, one has to ask, what more is there to consult on?""
""NatureScot's mystifying lack of backbone in the face of the nature and climate emergencies betrays so many people in the community who have engaged with this process in good faith and want the hope and renewal beavers would bring.""
Beavers died out in Scotland about 400 years ago but were reintroduced at a site in Argyll in 2009.
Conservation organisations say beaver activity can improve water quality and wetland habitats and also help to alleviate flooding.
But in the Cairngorms there has been criticism from farmers and crofters.
They said a proper consultation was not held ahead of the releases in the national park."
Rewilding work aims to restore vital fen wetland,A private company will restore a former daffodil farm at High Fen in Methwold to vital fen habitat.,11 Apr 2025,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynng9x2kno,"A former daffodil farm is to be returned to vital wetland through a rewilding project.
The project at the 292-hectare (721-acre) High Fen site in Methwold, Norfolk, is being undertaken by a private company called Nattergal.
It will be paid for by selling units of biodiversity net gain (BNG) to developers whose projects fail to meet a government target to boost nature.
Matt Hay, natural capital project manager at Nattergal, said the company used private investment to buy degraded land - unsuitable for agriculture - and restore it.
""We are not a charity, we are a for profit company,"" he said.
""We think if nature recovery is genuinely going to scale to the level we need to have a meaningful impact on the climate crisis, then it needs to be investable.""
The soil at High Fen is full of peat, so keeping it wet ensures the containment of stores of carbon.
Mr Hay said the rewilding was very different to preserving sites that were already nature-rich.
""We're not taking sites that are already good for nature and keeping them good,"" he said.
""We're taking degraded land where we believe the land use has historically not been appropriate and restoring those for nature.""
Key to the success of the project will be getting the site to stay wetter for longer.
High Fen site manager Frank Street said the creation of an 800m-long (2,625ft) earth embankment was recently completed.
""It has very low permeability,"" he said.
""We built this on the naturally slightly higher ground. The water won't ever be lapping at the bank but it will just stay, forming deeper pockets as it gets closer to the river banks.""
Wetland habitats support a wide range of plants, animals and birds.
Turtle doves, lapwings and cranes have already been spotted on the site.
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) saysthere is no single definition of rewilding.
Charles Hesketh, NFU regional policy manager for the East of England, said most farmers were already undertaking projects for the benefit of nature that could be defined as rewilding.
""There's obviously a bit more of it happening now than there perhaps was five or 10 years ago,"" he said.
""There's a mixed reception among the farming community. It can be a bit of a Marmite topic within agriculture.""

Fire service must 'adapt and invest' - mayor,A new action plan for North Yorkshire Fire Service lays out its approach for the next four years.,8 Apr 2025,North Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7ee76029o,"A county's fire and rescue service will be expected to adapt to deal with a wider range of emergencies in coming years, according to its new action plan.
The North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Plan, which sets out the service's priorities to 2029, was launched on Monday.
The aims of the plan, compiled by York and North Yorkshire's Combined Authority, include tackling the causes of fires, improving safety in buildings, preparing communities for emergencies and investing in new equipment and staff.
Mayor of York and North Yorkshire David Skaith said: ""The service needs to adapt and invest in estates, equipment and staff. Investing to make it more efficient will have a positive knock-on effect.""
Skaith said this year's hike in the fire and rescue precept - equivalent to a 28% increase, or £24, compared to 2024-5 - was necessary after years of under-investment.
The new plan recognised the challenges posed by climate change, which meant ""the calls the service is dealing with are changing"", Skaith explained.
He told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""Over the last 10 to 15 years, we've seen firefighters responding to much more flooding.
""The influx of visitors North Yorkshire gets every year - particularly in coastal areas - also adds pressure.""
Meanwhile, Jo Coles, deputy mayor for policing, fire and crime, said the plan also aimed to cut road deaths as firefighters were increasingly responding to traffic accidents.
Road safety was ""a big issue"" for the service, Coles said.
""Thirty two people died on the roads last year and we've had 11 deaths this year - and we're only in April.
""Every death is a tragedy and we want to work to raise awareness of road hazards to meet the aim of having zero people killed or seriously injured,"" she added.
Chief fire officer Jonathan Dyson said North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service was investing in new fire appliances and training for staff to make it fit for the future.
He said he welcomed the fact that more than 1,600 people had taken part in formulating the plan via a public consultation.

Rise in sewage spills prompts investment concerns,"An MP says the figures are ""disgraceful"" while Anglian Water promises ""transformational action"".",10 Apr 2025,Norfolk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynnz305z0o,"Concerns have been raised about infrastructure investment following an increase in the amount of sewage pumped into rivers and the sea in north Norfolk last year.
Untreated waste water was released in the east of England for almost 500,000 hours – a 64% increase on 2023 – with Anglian Water promising ""transformational action"" to tackle the problem.
Sewage flowed into the River Stiffkey, near Blakeney, for more than 1,500 hours, while beaches at West Runton, East Runton and Mundesley, all of which have Blue Flag status for excellent water quality, were near overflow pipes that had increased spills.
North Norfolk Lib Dem MP Steffan Aquarone said the Environment Agency's data was ""disgraceful"".
He said: ""The people of north Norfolk deserve so much better than filthy water and polluted oceans.
""I'll keep on demanding that Anglian Water increase their investment in the area and that the money goes towards urgently improving our rural and coastal sewage infrastructure.""
The releases came from storm overflows, which dump untreated sewage into rivers and the sea, usually during periods of heavy rain, to stop sewers backing up and flooding.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, more than 500 hours of spills came from Cromer's main sewage works out in the North Sea, off the coast of West Runton.
It had 91 spills, while another pipe on West Runton beach had 116 hours of spills during 32 incidents.
One mile (about 1.5km) along the coast, East Runton beach regained its Blue Flag status last summer but was closed for several days in June due to sewage pollution.
At Mundesley, an outfall off the coast had 87 spills lasting for a total of 371 hours and a pipe on the beach had two spills totalling nearly seven hours.
North Norfolk District Council leader Tim Adams said the figures ""proved there is still an awful of infrastructure work needed"".
Anglian Water has said it would spend £1bn to tackle spills.
""We know our customers will be disappointed to see an increase in our storm overflow data this year,"" a spokeswoman said.
""This is largely reflective of the extreme weather and persistent flooding we saw across our region in the first part of 2024, which accounted for nearly 50% of our spills.
""We have promised transformational action – because we know our climate is going to keep changing, so we have to find better ways of dealing with extreme rainfall.""

Charity hopes ban will boost butterfly population,The Butterfly Conservation said it was one of the worst years for butterflies in Derbyshire.,4 Apr 2025,Derbyshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq520pj8lo,"A butterfly charity hopes a government ban on certain pesticides could reverse a significant decline in populations.
The Butterfly Conservation recorded a 40% fall in butterflies in Derbyshire last year, from 110,425 in 2023 to 65,268.
National figures show more than half of the UK's butterfly species have populations in long-term decline - 31 of 59 species have had a reduction in numbers since 1976, when monitoring began
Ken Orpe, who runs the East Midlands branch of the Butterfly Conservation, told the BBC: ""Butterflies are an indication of the health of our countryside.""
Mr Orpe said climate change and habitat loss are big factors in declining populations.
But he added neonicotinoids, a type of pesticide, are the ""biggest enemy"" of butterflies and welcomed the government issuing a widespread ban on the practice, which he hopes will increase numbers.
Neonicotinoids are the most widely-used insecticides globally.
They are used on more than 140 crop varieties to control a variety of pests, especially sap-feeding insects.
Environmental groups have said these are highly toxic to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
""If you spray the crops and the butterflies are attracted to the nectar, as soon as they take in the chemical, they are dead,"" Mr Orpe said.
""[The ban] should make a big difference but we'll know better in the middle of the year.""
A total of 350 volunteers were out across Derbyshire on Tuesday counting butterflies,
However, Mr Orpe said it is still too early in the year to gauge if the numbers are up or down yet.
""The peacock is the largest garden butterfly people spotted - we had a dozen at one site but it was one of the only species that did well last year,"" he said.
""The rest of them did terrible but it's not all bad news because of climate change, there are some new species moving in to the county.
""We have had nine new species since 1995 move to Derbyshire which have moved up from the south.
""I used to have to go to Sussex or Hampshire to see the Purple Emperor but now we get them here.""

Couples 'in limbo' as wedding venue suddenly shuts,"The venue in Kendal says ""every effort"" was made to try and sell the business as a going concern.",3 Apr 2025,Cumbria,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6jv406885o,"Couples have been left in limbo over their wedding plans after a popular venue suddenly shut.
News that The Villa Levens near Kendal, Cumbria, had closed started circulating on social media on 1 April, leading many to believe it was a tasteless April Fools' Day prank.
The venue confirmed to the BBC it ""reluctantly closed"" its doors due to the ""huge strain"" on the business in ""the current economic climate"", and said creditors and employees would be contacted by the liquidator.
Kerrie Tremble, from Morecambe, Lancashire, who was due to get married there on 3 May to fiance Jack Riley, said she had been left ""in a state of disbelief"".
The couple had booked the venue two years ago and were sent the final bill for their upcoming wedding on Monday.
Miss Tremble, 37, said: ""We've just been left in complete and utter limbo to just work it out for ourselves.""
Couples who want to marry in England must give notice to a registrar four weeks before the ceremony and confirm the venue.
It means if Miss Tremble and Mr Riley had not been able to secure an alternative venue and give notice on Wednesday, they would not have been able to get married on their chosen date.
The couple said the timing was a ""silver lining"" but they had to call up to 40 venues to find a new one.
""[The date] was really important to us, we picked that bank holiday weekend two years ago because we've got a lot of family travelling in from all over the UK,"" said Miss Tremble.
Mr Riley, 39, said he was grateful to the many suppliers who accommodated the switch to the alternative venue, however they lost deposits on some who said the change was a breach of their terms and conditions.
The couple said they had ""luckily"" recently taken out insurance, after seeing another local venue close and the impact it had on couples.
Miss Tremble added: ""It will take a while to get any money back and of course we still need to pay the new venue - it's not ideal by any stretch.""
Kendal couple Brandon Carder and his fiancee Poppy Rhodes had recently signed a contract to book The Villa Levens and had paid the deposit on Monday.
""We went along on Monday to pay and everyone was all smiles – they must have been completely unaware,"" said Mr Carder, 29.
""When I saw the posts on social media I thought it was a really distasteful April Fools' joke. When I told my partner about it she was really upset.""
He said they had spoken to the bank and they were hopeful to recoup their deposit.
Sarah Capstick, 48, booked the venue with her fiance Phillip King, 46, for their wedding on 25 May.
When Miss Capstick, of Kendal, saw social media reports of The Villa Levens having ceased trading, she decided to go there after being unable to reach them on the phone.
She said: ""There were people emptying out the building, so I asked if there was someone there I could speak to.
""[A member of staff] came out to speak to me and was in tears, saying she'd only just found out.""
Miss Capstick said they had paid the final balance two weeks ago and having paid cash she feared they would be ""stuck"".
She added the couple were visiting a different venue with availability for their dates, but they ""can't afford to pay out again"".
A spokesman for The Villa Levens said the owners had ""reluctantly closed the business with immediate effect"".
""Like many hospitality businesses, the current economic climate has applied a huge strain on the business with increased costs and employment costs which are increasing further from April of this year,"" they said in a statement.
""Whilst every effort has been made to sell the business as a going concern sadly, we have been unable to do so, therefore it has been sold on a closed basis.

Ski resort to keep making artificial snow until May,The ski centre's boss says it has been a challenging winter thanks to a lack of natural snowfall.,3 Apr 2025,Highlands & Islands,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq7d2rypn2o,"One of Scotland's mountain ski resorts is to keep artificially producing snow until May.
Andy Meldrum, managing director of Glencoe Mountain, said it had been a poor winter in terms of natural snowfall.
The site started manufacturing snow in November and has kept it topped up since then. The 80m (262ft) long slope open remains open for sledging and beginner skiing.
Mr Meldrum said: ""We've not had a lot of snow, but have done okay. It's certainly not the worst season we've had.""
The site's snow factory can make 100 cubic metres of snow a day.
Other ski resorts, including Cairngorm Mountain, also use artificially-made snow during the winter season.
Cairngorm managed 100 days of skiing on their slope, before it melted earlier this week. The centre said snow sports could resume if conditions allowed for it.
Mr Meldrum said Glencoe has had one of its poorest seasons in terms of skiers, with about 7,000 so far when usually there would have about 25,000 visitors over the winter season.
But he said numbers of people sledging has been higher than normal - 23,000 so far compared to 15,000.
Mr Meldrum said it had been a drier winter than usual, which led to fewer days when it snowed.
He said: ""We have a maritime climate. We've got used to that at Glencoe.
""We have amazing seasons, we have dreadful seasons, good ones and bad ones.""
""When it does snow we make sure we are ready to have everything open. When it doesn't snow we try to provide other stuff.""
The snow slope is to be open for skiing until late April and sledging until early May.
The Lecht and Glenshee snowsports centres in Aberdeenshire are closed to snowsports due to a lack of snow.
We often associate winter as cold, damp and dark with expectations of snow, frost and ice, writes BBC Scotland Weather's Christopher Blanchett.
But like any of our seasons, winter has natural variations and we can't always rely on it to fully support our winter sports industry.
Meteorologists class winter as December, January and February.
Overall, the winter just gone was drier and warmer than normal - according to provisional statistics from the Met Office.
The mean temperature for the season in Scotland was 3.7C, which is 0.7C higher than normal.
The average rainfall was 425mm (16.7in), which is 86% of the long-term average. However, as with all statistics there were some distinct regional and monthly variations.
December was wetter than normal but also much warmer.
The mean temperature was 2.1C higher than average, making it the seventh warmest December in Scotland on record by that metric, in a series that dates back to 1884.
Despite a third more rain than normal, which in theory should mean more snow at higher elevations, those higher temperatures may have scuppered that potential benefit.
There were cold spells during the winter, these were often followed by a very mild south-south-westerly, with freezing levels rising above the tops and a lot of the snow melting.
With changing climate trends in our warming world, future winters may make it even harder for the industry to have a good season."
In pictures: Scottish nature photo awards 2024,"Images taken in Shetland, Orkney, Highlands and Edinburgh were among the winners.",1 Apr 2025,Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0w33z0gwzo,"The 15th annual Scottish Nature Photography Awards winners have been announced.
Nicki Gwynn-Jones, who lives in Orkney, won the main prize with a picture of a fulmar in a rain shower on a cold December day.
She said it was the middle of the day and the sun was low in the sky.
""I was desperately hoping for something special in those few moments when the raking winter light was producing deep shadows and gorgeous golden tones,"" said Nicki.
Edinburgh filmmaker Richard Nicholls won the video award with a short film called 19th July 2022, which looked at climate change and Scotland.
He was filming in Edinburgh on Scotland's hottest day when the unusually high temperature spurred him into embarking on a project on the climate crisis.
The film documents his journey working with NatureScot's Peatland Action team to raise awareness of the need to restore peatland."
UK Environment Agency orders review into tyre recycling after BBC probe,Environment Agency review waste tyre exports after BBC probe reveals millions sent to furnaces in India.,2 Apr 2025,Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grlpyje41o,"The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.
Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being ""cooked"" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.
The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a ""lack of action"" over the issue of tyre exports.
The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.
The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.
But BBC File on 4 Investigates and Source Material, a non-profit journalism group, revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are ""cooked"" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.
Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.
In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.
A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways around. Villagers complained of persistent coughs and eye problems.
Following the broadcast, the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC File on 4 Investigates that officials and lawyers within the EA were ""very keen"" to investigate the claims made in the programme, including any potential criminal activity.
In a letter seen by the BBC, lawyers for the EA said that our investigation would be carefully considered as part of a review it has launched into its approach to waste tyre shipments.
They added that the EA has been working to engage the relevant environmental authorities in India on this issue and is taking steps to arrange a delegation to meet with officials later this year.
Fighting Dirty founder Georgia Elliott-Smith, who has been in correspondence with the EA over this issue since 2023, said it was a ""major victory"" for the group and that ""the government must stop turning a blind eye to the illegal and immoral activity"".

Up to 800 jobs set to be cut at two NHS trusts,"The spokesperson says the cuts will be ""difficult"" but ""necessary"" to meet patients' needs.",11 Apr 2025,Hampshire & Isle of Wight,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xx0kn3yyo,"Up to 800 jobs could be lost across two NHS trusts in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, with others set to follow suit.
The move is part of a financial plan to saving millions of pounds over the year ahead.
Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust has earmarked 549 jobs to go, while 249 could be lost at the Isle of Wight NHS Trust.
A spokesperson for the two bodies said while the cuts would be ""difficult"" they were ""necessary in helping ensure our organisations are able to continue meeting the changing needs of our patients"".
The BBC understands there will be more job losses, including hundreds at neighbouring trusts.
CEOs of trusts in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are believed to be discussing how they can share resources and corporate services.
The roles being lost are not thought to be clinical positions, such as doctors and nurses, and the staff at risk are expected to be within HR, finance and communications.
All trusts are operating in a difficult financial climate and are looking to make big savings.
The shake-up is driven by the Department of Health and Social Care, which has said it is part of a wider plan to protect frontline services and help improve patient care.
The major NHS unions Unison and Unite will meet to discuss the proposed job losses next week.
Further losses of up to 50% are also expected at the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board (ICB) and other ICBs in the region.
The news follows the decision to abolish NHS England, the body responsible for commissioning and improving health services across the UK.
""As providers, we have a responsibility to live within our means and deliver the required performance and quality standards for our patients,"" the spokesperson for Portsmouth and Isle of Wight NHS trusts said.
They said the trusts ""delivered significant improvements across finance and performance"" in 2024/25, but that they face ""similar challenges in terms of financial savings, so need to go further in our approach to deliver the scale of improvement expected of us"".
They added: ""This includes further tightening our controls on temporary workforce and recruitment activity, as well as well as seeking further opportunities to transform how we deliver within each organisation and at scale across our group and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight system.
""Across Hampshire and Isle of Wight, we have all agreed common processes around vacancies, recruitment, and use of temporary workforce to help us achieve the significant financial savings required of us.
""We understand these decisions may be difficult, but they are necessary in helping ensure our organisations are able to continue meeting the changing needs of our patients in a more resilient and flexible way.""
The Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are reforming the NHS to cut bureaucracy and make savings so we can focus on empowering frontline staff to deliver better care for patients, while getting value for taxpayers' money.
""We are investing an extra £26 billion in health and care, and have already made progress on our mission to cut waiting lists – delivering an extra 3 million appointments in six months and cutting the waiting list by 219,000 since July.""
A spokesperson for NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight said: ""Like the rest of the NHS, we are working collectively with our NHS providers across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight to make sure services are sustainable, affordable for the future and meet the changing needs of our local communities.
""This means we have been working with our NHS providers to put tighter processes in place around recruitment and to reduce reliance on expensive temporary staffing. This is being done while ensuring services remain safe and people continue to get the care, treatment and support they need.""

Where EV batteries go to die - and be reborn,"Batteries for electric vehicles are notoriously difficult to recycle, but growing demand for the rare metals they contain is leading to innovative new ways of retrieving them.",5 Apr 2025,Future,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250404-where-ev-batteries-go-to-die-and-be-reborn,"Batteries for electric vehicles are notoriously difficult to recycle, but growing demand for the rare metals they contain is leading to innovative new ways of retrieving them from used power cells.
I am standing in a lab where batteries go to be reborn. But first, they must be shredded.
What arrives here is a dark powder called ""black mass"" – a substance derived from pulverising batteries almost to oblivion. Each particle is less than a millimetre across. Staff working for Altilium, a recycling firm in the south-west of England, are now tasked with extracting crucial materials from this pitch black disorder.
The powder contains some plastic and steel from the battery which must be separated out, but there are also sought-after materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite. These are the prized ingredients with which the lab workers here can make a new battery.
As the climate crisis intensifies, the world is electrifying. Countries are increasingly shifting away from fossil fuels towards renewable sources of energy including solar panels and wind turbines. Homeowners are installing heat pumps in the place of old gas or oil boilers. And drivers are increasingly buying electric vehicles (EVs) powered by batteries.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly one in five cars sold in 2023 was electric. This was a 35% year-on-year increase compared to 2022 and brought the number of EVs on the world's roads to 40 million. The problem with this is that demand for batteries, and the materials required to make them, is soaring.
""One of the big challenges is that the minerals are kind of concentrated in certain places,"" says Christian Marston, president and chief operating officer of Altilium. Over half of the world's nickel comes from Indonesia, while two-thirds of all cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo – both of which have ongoing human rights issues associated with mining operations.
That's why there's now a race to find other ways of sourcing those key minerals. Recycling batteries is one option, but is also notoriously difficult. Staff at Altilium, however, say they've cracked it.
Altilium's facility is squirreled away in the unassuming English town of Tavistock. Getting here involves driving across the windswept expanse of Dartmoor, sometimes slowing to a crawl to wait for sheep to get off the road. When I arrive, I find Altilium's building on a mundane industrial estate with a tyre shop across the road – but what they're cooking up inside is anything but mundane.
In the lab I find racks of glass cylinders linked together by tubes, all filled with brightly coloured liquids – mostly vivid blues and greens – running the length of the room. Nearby, a technician wearing a white lab coat and safety glasses studies the workings of these contraptions.
This is Altilium's solvent extraction lab, where staff retrieve sought-after battery ingredients from the black mass they process here.
It all began in late 2020, but got off to a slow start. ""We lost two years because of Covid,"" says Marston ruefully.
But in mid-2022, he and colleagues took out a lease on the Tavistock facility – at the time, an ""empty shed"", says chief technology officer Ben Wickham. The team built several laboratories, and began developing their recycling process on a small scale. Three years later, they are commissioning a larger plant just outside nearby Plymouth, which will supply recycled materials to battery manufacturers.
The company is one of just a handful of firms around the world that are developing methods for recycling batteries sourced from old EVs. Such firms promise to bring us one step closer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and also closer to a circular economy, in which almost nothing is thrown away.
""We have to remove that myth that batteries go to landfill,"" says Marston. As EVs have become more popular, more and more of them are now reaching the end of their useful lives. That means more exhausted batteries from those aging vehicles have become available. Recycling batteries prevents expensive – and toxic – materials getting into the environment.
Some of the other companies working on battery recycling technology are located in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by President Biden's administration in 2022, which funded climate actions, has helped to motivate such efforts. Li-Cycle, a company established in 2016 which recovers critical materials from lithium-ion batteries, has plants in Canada, the US and Germany, for instance.
Hype meter
While lots of companies are working on battery recycling technologies, it's worth considering how much progress each of them have actually made to date. Altilium has, to its credit, actually manufactured battery cells using recycled materials from end-of-life electric vehicle batteries.
But this is still far from a conveyor belt churning out finished batteries ready for consumer use. Companies currently developing environmentally-friendly forms of battery recycling must show that they can compete with more polluting but established approaches, such as pyrometallurgy. Plus, processing of the black mass from old, shredded batteries often occurs in Asia today, partly because costs are lower there.
Redwood Materials, a US company with campuses in Northern Nevada and South Carolina, was established in 2017 by one of the founders of electric car company Tesla, and has partnerships with carmakers Toyota, VW and BMW. Some older materials companies have also started experimenting, notably the Texas-based Ecobat Solutions. And many other firms are now also investing in battery recycling tech.
Despite the interest, however, there's much progress to be made in the area. ""The current lithium-ion battery recycling market is still in a very early industrial stage,"" says Xiaochu Wei, a battery recycling researcher at Imperial College London in the UK.
Last year, German chemicals firm BASF ""paused"" work on a battery recycling plant in Spain, though the company says it still intends to build the facility.
Part of the challenge in this field is how complex batteries are to begin with, which makes recycling them tricky.
Every battery has two main components: the cathode and the anode. When providing power to, say, a motor, the anode releases negatively-charged electrons, which flow around a circuit until they return to the battery and are absorbed by the cathode. Electrons flow in the opposite direction when the battery is charging.
In an electric vehicle battery, the cathode and anode are both thin sheets of material. The two are wrapped around each other in a spiral, like a Swiss roll with incredibly thin layers. In many battery designs, the anode is made of graphite, the same kind of carbon used in the cores of pencils. The cathode, meanwhile, often contains a variety of metals, including nickel, lithium and cobalt.
Although recycling such structures is difficult, opportunity lies in the large number of valuable materials available, all of which can be sold lucratively if extracted and purified. Somewhat frustratingly, those materials are rather closely intermingled, and many of them are dangerous: several of the metals are toxic to people and wildlife, and they also pose fire and explosion hazards.
Altilium's battery shredding process recovers graphite, originally from the anode, alongside other minerals. Getting graphite back out of a battery used to require a high-temperature process called pyrometallurgy, but this produces significant emissions, which is partly why Altilium has adopted a water-based system called hydrometallurgy. Staff soak the black mass in sulphuric acid, which allows them to filter out the graphite. This can be sold back to battery manufacturers, after some additional processing.
What's left is an acidic liquid with a variety of metals dissolved in it. Some of them – aluminium, copper and iron – are not very valuable. By tweaking the acidity, the team can force them to precipitate out as grey powder. This, Wickham says, could be sold as filler for building materials.
Now the team is in a position to extract the valuable nickel, cobalt and manganese. It recovers these one by one, mixing the liquid with kerosene and special chemicals that pull the metals out of solution. This is the step I saw with the glass tubes full of coloured liquids.
Wickham explains that Altilium takes this approach because manufacturers are constantly changing the chemical makeup of batteries. ""Battery chemistry is moving fast,"" he says. Wickham argues that battery companies will increasingly rely on nickel, compared to other metals, because it stores more energy for a given volume. (Some emerging battery designs, however, are moving away from nickel because of its high price tag.)
By separating out individual metals, Altilium aims to supply battery manufacturers with the exact mixes they want for their new cathodes. The goal is to create a ""closed-loop EV battery supply chain"" in the UK, says Marston.
Methods that reduce old batteries to their component raw materials will be essential for sustainable economies, says Anna Hankin, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London in the UK, who is working on a project funded by Altilium alongside Wei. While it's possible to regenerate used batteries by replacing chemicals lost from individual components, ""at some point that process will stop working"", she says. ""There will come a point for every battery when its components need to be shredded.""
Besides easing the transition to net zero, Marston argues that recycling EV batteries will take us a step closer to a circular economy, where, as much as possible, raw materials would be reused and recycled endlessly. This would reduce the need for extractive industries such as mining, which often damage ecosystems and pose risks to human health.
In the case of EV batteries, instead of mining more lithium, nickel and other metals from the ground, we can keep reusing the supplies we already have. Researchers have estimated that, by 2040, over half the demand for lithium and nickel for these batteries could be supplied by recycling.
In the next five to 10 years, Wei says, recycling could provide ""a decent share"" of the raw materials needed to make EV batteries – somewhere between 10% and 40%, she estimates. It would help if battery manufacturers redesigned their batteries to make it easier for recycling facilities to separate out the key components, she adds.
If recycling takes off, the benefits could be significant. According to a 2024 IEA report, greater recycling of critical minerals could reduce the need for new mining by as much as 40% by mid-century. The IEA notes that many governments are creating policies to encourage recycling. For instance, in 2023 the European Union introduced a new Battery Regulation, which will introduce increasingly stringent requirements for ""recycling efficiency, material recovery and recycled content"", beginning in 2025.
This isn't just about being environmentally friendly: there are also geopolitical motivations. In the last 20 years, the international order of things has significantly destabilised, with shocks such as Brexit and the policies of US President Donald Trump impacting global trade and international cooperation. Countries that are overly dependent on imports of critical supplies face significant risks in this new world, says Marston.
The minerals used in EV batteries will be increasingly important for countries to continue functioning. ""The future economies will be the ones which control the critical minerals,"" says Marston. That means countries like the UK have a problem. ""The UK doesn't have these minerals at scale.""
In Marston's view, recycling electric vehicle batteries ensures energy security. ""We see batteries which are in this country as a strategic asset in the UK,"" he says. Instead of sending them abroad to be recycled – possibly in a country with poor environmental and labour laws – he wants them to be recycled domestically. ""If you do the processing in the UK, you add the value in the UK,"" he says.
The challenge for all these companies is to scale up. Altilium is currently commissioning its new larger plant which should be able to operate continuously. If that proves successful, the company has plans for two progressively larger facilities.
""If we do battery recycling at scale, we have confidence that we can produce a material which is around 20% lower cost than commercial material,"" says Marston. ""That would look like 150,000 EV batteries per year.""

Alcohol makes male fruit flies more attractive,Alcohol increases the release of chemical sex signals and makes males more attractive to females.,2 Apr 2025,No tag,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8e772enngo,"Male fruit flies that drink alcohol become more attractive to females, according to a new study.
Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.
Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.
Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.
Previous research has studied different theories about this attraction, such as the flies were seeking a euphoric state or a substitute for the high of mating among males rejected by females.
Study author Bill Hansson, head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute, said such research has taken an anthropomorphic view of fly behaviour, whereas this latest study suggests drinking alcohol gives the flies a reproductive advantage.
""We don't think flies drink alcohol because they are depressed,"" he said.
The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.
In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.
Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.
Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.
The new study also showed that the fly's response to smelling alcohol is controlled by three different neural circuits in its brain.
While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.
Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.
""This means that the flies have a control mechanism that allows them to get all the benefits of alcohol consumption without risking alcohol intoxication,"" lead author Ian Keesey, of the University of Nebraska, said.
For their investigations, the researchers combined physiological studies - such as imaging techniques to visualise processes in the fly brain, chemical analyses of environmental odours, and behavioural studies.
The paper is published in the journal Science Advances."
Vigil for GP jailed over Just Stop Oil protest,The Bristol GP was jailed for a year in January for his role in a protest.,30 Mar 2025,Bristol,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq7j5z85z1o,"Scores of people took part in a city centre vigil for a GP jailed over his role in a Just Stop Oil protest.
Dr Patrick Hart, 38, was sentenced to 12 months in prison in January after causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to 16 fuel pumps at a service station in Essex in August 2022.
In March, Dr Hart also had his General Medical Council registration suspended for an interim 12-month period, and faces a possible further suspension following his release.
About 150 people, including former colleagues and patients, gathered at Cascade Steps in Bristol on Saturday to raise awareness of his sentence.
Dr Romola Pocock, a GP and former colleague of Dr Hart's at Bridge View Medical Practice, said he had shown ""care, integrity and dedication"" to his job and was ""greatly missed by patients and colleagues"".
Fellow GP at the practice Dr Emily Pollard said: ""Will history remember doctors who stood against the destruction of the health of our planet as criminals?""
Dr Hart was arrested after hitting petrol pumps with a hammer, spraying them with orange pain and ""obstructed or otherwise interfered with the refuelling of vehicles"", and was found guilty of causing criminal damage.
Essex County Council said the cost of repairing the pumps was £9,376, with the temporary closure of the petrol station leading to lost profits of £1,146, the court heard during his sentencing.
Dr Hart had previously taken part in other demonstrations with Just Stop Oil, and said he had been prepared to risk his career to do what he believes is ""the right thing"".
Ahead of the vigil on Saturday a spokesperson for the British Medical Association said: ""The climate crisis is a health crisis.
""Doctors, like Patrick Hart, find it very difficult to understand why their ability to practise medicine could be suspended because of nonviolent actions they take in protest of the climate crisis.""
Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions.
The world has been warming up quickly over the past 100 years or so. As a result, weather patterns are changing.
Between 2014 and 2023, global temperatures were on average around 1.2C above those of the late 19th Century, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, the UK Met Office says.
The year 2024 was the world's hottest on record and was the first year to pass the 1.5C warning limit.

UK's first water tracking centre could prevent pandemic,The data could be used to alert public health teams of new outbreaks.,9 Apr 2025,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxne2gk5no,"The UK's first pilot wastewater monitoring centre could help avoid future pandemics, a university has said.
The public health surveillance system, based on detecting traces of chemicals and biological markers found in water, has been launched at the University of Bath.
Researchers at the £13m Centre of Excellence Water-Based Early-Warning Systems for Health Protection (CWBE) will track virus and bacterial DNA in wastewater samples, which can act as an early-warning system for outbreaks of infectious diseases.
Weekly samples from four ""living labs"" in areas of Bath and Bristol, and in rural Paulton and Radstock, Somerset, will be monitored.
Once established in Bath, the team hope the system will be rolled out nationwide.
The data could be used to alert public health teams of new outbreaks and help hospitals prepare for treating patients.
Chemicals excreted by the body will also be tracked through samples, and will indicate everything from chronic disease, stress or inflammation.
Medications or drugs, dietary habits or exposure to pesticides, and personal care products will be tracked from the samples.
CWBE lead professor Barbara Kasprzyk-Hordern, from the University's Institute of Sustainability and Climate Change, said: ""We saw during the Covid pandemic how useful it was to get data on numbers infected and their location, but it took days to get data back from PCR tests and was very expensive.""
It is cheaper and faster to analyse wastewater, which whole communities contribute to than go through clinical screening, she said.
""WBE is comprehensive, anonymous and unbiased and it can pick up asymptomatic cases, those from difficult-to-reach communities or areas lacking testing infrastructure,"" she added.
Researchers will work with partners at Wessex Water to collect and analyse the weekly samples.
As well as detecting infectious disease outbreaks, the centre also has research projects planned to identify new synthetic drugs being used in communities, and to study the effects of diet and lifestyle choices with chronic health conditions.

Australia's looming election brings housing crisis into focus,"Australia's housing crisis has hit its worst point in decades, becoming a key issue in the upcoming election.",14 Apr 2025,Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5wlevy647o,"Buying or renting a home has become unaffordable for the average Australian, driven by a perfect storm of astronomical house prices, relentless rental increases and a lack of social housing.
With less than a month until the federal election, housing remains among the top issues for voters, and the country's two major parties – the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition - have both pledged to tackle the crisis in a range of ways.
Australians are already struggling under cost-of-living pressures and bracing for the effects of Donald Trump's global tariff war. And it remains to be seen whether either party will sway voters with their promise of restoring the Australian dream.
Simply put, Australia has not been building enough homes to meet the demands of its rapidly growing population, creating a scarcity that makes any available home more expensive to buy or rent.
Compounding the issue are Australia's restrictive planning laws, which prevent homes being built where most people want to live, such as in major cities.
Red tape means that popular metropolitan areas like Melbourne and Sydney are far less dense than comparably sized cities around the world.
The steady decline of public housing and ballooning waitlists have made matters worse, tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions.
Climate change has also made many areas increasingly unliveable, with natural disasters such as bushfires and severe storms destroying large swathes of properties.
Meanwhile, decades of government policies have commercialised property ownership. So the ideal of owning a home, once seen as a right in Australia, has turned into an investment opportunity.
In short: it depends where you live.
Sydney is currently the second least affordable city in the world to buy a property, according to a 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.
The latest data from property analytics company CoreLogic shows the average Sydney home costs almost A$1.2m (£570,294, $742,026).
Across the nation's capital cities, the combined average house price sits at just over A$900,000.
House prices in Australia overall have also jumped 39.1% in the last five years - and wages have failed to keep up.
It now takes the average prospective homeowner around 10 years to save the 20% deposit usually required to buy an average home, according to a 2024 State of the Housing System report.
The rental market has provided little relief, with rents increasing by 36.1% nationally since the onset of Covid - an equivalent rise of A$171 per week.
Sydney topped the charts with a median weekly rent of A$773, according to CoreLogic's latest rental review. Perth came in second with average rents at A$695 per week, followed by Canberra at A$667 per week.
Immigration and foreign property purchases are often cited as causes for Australia's housing crisis. But experts say that they are not significant contributors  statistically.
Many people who move to Australia are temporary migrants, such as international students who live in dedicated student accommodation rather than entering the housing market, according to Michael Fotheringham, head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.
""The impact [of migrants] on the housing market is not as profound as some commentators have suggested,"" Mr Fotheringham tells the BBC.
The federal government also recently sought to crack down on foreign homebuyers, by tripling fees.
However that is ""a very small issue"" with not much meaningful impact on housing strain, says Brendan Coates, from the Grattan Institute public policy think tank.
The latest data released by the Australian Taxation Office supports this, with homes purchased by foreign buyers in 2022-23 representing less than one percent of all sales.
""It's already very difficult for foreigners to purchase homes under existing foreign investment rules. They are subject to a wide range of taxes, particularly in some states,"" Mr Coates explains.
Labor and the Coalition have both promised to invest in building more homes – with Labor offering 1.2 million by 2029, and the Coalition vowing to unlock 500,000.
In their respective campaign launches, both parties promote housing initiatives aimed at first homebuyers.
Labor has pledged to expand an existing shared-equity scheme to allow all first homebuyers to purchase homes with a 5% deposit, an ease on the 20% deposit typically needed.
Albanese also promised 100,000 of the new homes his government creates will only be available to first homebuyers, in addition to building more social housing and introducing subsidies to help low-to-moderate-income earners.
The Coalition, if elected, will allow first-time buyers to use up to $50,000 from their superannuation retirement savings to fund a house purchase. They will make mortgage payments partially tax free for up to five years for all first homebuyers with newly built properties.
Central to the Coalition's housing affordability policy is cutting migration, reducing the number of international students and implementing a two-year ban on foreign investment in existing properties.
Additionally, they have promised a A$5bn boost to infrastructure to support local councils by paying for water, power and sewerage at housing development sites.
The Greens' policies, meanwhile, have focused on alleviating pressures on renters by calling for national rent freezes and caps.
They have also said that in the event of a minority government, they will be pushing to reform tax incentives for investors.
In short, experts say that while both Labor and the Coalition's policies are steps in the right direction, neither are sufficient to solve the housing problem.
""A combination of both parties' platforms would be better than what we're seeing from either side individually,"" Mr Coates tells the BBC.
A 2025 State of the Land report by the Urban Development Institute of Australia says the federal government will fail to meet its target of 1.2 million new homes by 2029 – falling short by almost 400,000.
The Coalition's focus on reducing immigration, meanwhile, will only make housing marginally cheaper while making Australia poorer in the long-term, according to Mr Coates.
The cuts to migration will mean fewer skilled migrants, he explains, and the loss of revenue from those migrants will result in higher taxes for Australians.
Decades of underinvestment in social housing also means demand in that area is massively outstripping supply - which at 4% of housing stock is significantly lower than many other countries, according to Mr Fotheringham.
There's also concern about grants for first homebuyers, which drive prices up further.
While commending the fact that these issues are finally being treated seriously, Mr Fotheringham believes it will take years to drag Australia out of a housing crisis that has been building for decades.
""We've been sleepwalking into this as a nation for quite some time,"" he says. ""[Now] the nation is paying attention, the political class is paying attention.""

Solar farm approved despite local opposition,"The application for panels on 136 acres of farmland, near Long Sutton, was narrowly voted through.",4 Apr 2025,Hampshire & Isle of Wight,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zl639vxzo,"Plans to build a solar farm on about 136 acres of Hampshire farmland have narrowly been given approval.
Hart District Council voted five to four in favour of the application for fields between Long Sutton and Odiham airfield.
Ian Howard, from campaign group Save Our Landscape, described the project as ""an opportunistic landgrab"" which ""removes valuable farmland out of production"".
But developer Fleet Solar Ltd said the installation would provide enough energy to power about 18,000 homes, while grassland and wildflower meadows would be planted around and under the panels.
Speaking at the development management committee meeting, Mr Howard said people living in the area had ""deep concerns"", insisting such developments should be built ""in appropriate locations, on new buildings, grey-belt land or alongside motorways"".
Jim Goodbourn, chair of Long Sutton Parish Council, said ""This is simply the wrong scheme in the wrong location.
""The serious negative impact on mental health, wellbeing and our environment cannot be overlooked.""
In November, the government announced new climate change targets, aiming for an 81% cut in emissions by 2035.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said solar power would provide ""an abundant source of cleaner, cheaper energy on the mission towards 2030"".
The Long Sutton project has approval for a 40-year period after which the solar farm will be decommissioned with the land returning to the landowner.
Fleet Solar Ltd plans to begin construction in the summer of 2027 and hopes to have the panels connected to the grid by autumn 2028.

Next 10 days crucial for farmers 'praying' for rain,Nigel Friend raises concerns about the impact of the driest April on record for farming.,2 hrs ago,England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmknz78n29o,"A twofold blow of record sunshine and low rainfall has left crops in ""survival mode"" and struggling to grow, a farmer has warned.
The Met Office previously confirmed April 2025 saw the most sunshine in the UK since records began 115 years ago - with 47% more hours of sunshine than the long-term average.
The recent weather follows England's wettest 18-month period between October 2022 and March 2024, which caused damage to the soil, according the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
Arable farmer Nigel Friend raises animals and grows crops at Cranborne Chase in Dorset, he said unless the weather improved in the next ten days, there could be grain shortages.
Mr Friend told BBC Radio Solent presenter Steve Harris he had been farming all his life and this year, farmers needed ""significant amounts of rainfall"".
""Crops are suffering, the increased heat is causing problems for animals as well, with things like fly strike on sheep being very early this year and obviously we're preserving our foraged stocks for the winter ahead, because we don't have any grass,"" he explained.
Mr Friend said farmers across the UK had ""suffered two horrendously wet years"", which had damaged the soil, but after the recent dry weather he was now finding cracks on his farm at least 10in (25.4cm) deep.
George Brown, who grows porridge oats, spring barley and white clover on Priors Farm in Peasemore near Newbury, shares Mr Friend's concerns.
He said: ""You've got to remind yourself you've been very lucky to have the sun at your back, but really I've been praying for rain for the last six weeks.
""We wanted some rain to get the crops growing out of the ground, but it just hasn't turned up.""
Elsewhere in Basingstoke, Hampshire, Ian Constable said he had been forced to adapt the way his farm was feeding its animals.
Mr Constable, who Street Croft Farm in Herriard, explained: ""Obviously no rain, so no grass growth.
""We've got a few hundred lambs and ewes running around and there's not a lot for them to eat.
""All the grass just hasn't taken off this year, which means we're supplementary feeding everything, buying in a lot of feed to keep them fed and healthy.""
Alan Hutton, chair of Hampshire's National Farmers' Union, added: ""Farming is an extraordinarily risky occupation.
""I want to reassure the public there is not going to be a food shortage this year, but please if you're coming to the countryside, treat it with respect.
""It is going to be very, very dry this summer, so please don't go smoking and throwing cigarettes out the window and that sort of thing – it is your food supply after all.""
Mr Friend is expecting dry weather for another 10 weeks based on long-range forecasting, but said the next 10 days would be ""crucial"" for farmers.
""Normally by now you would expect wheat to be knee high, at the moment it's halfway between your ankle and your knee.
""The weather over the next 10 days will make the difference between us having reasonable crop to harvest and a disastrous crop due to the lack of moisture.""
Mr Friend's concerns come after the Environment Agency warned there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought.
The Met Office told BBC Weather the UK had experienced an average rainfall accumulation of 80mm so far this spring, compared to an average of 229mm, making it the driest spring on record.

What matters to Kent voters in the local elections,"Residents in Maidstone are speaking out about what matters to them, from potholes to libraries.",9 Apr 2025,Kent,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78jeq8qdl9o,"Voters in Kent will soon get to have their say over who is in charge of our local services, from education to social care, libraries and road surfaces.
The Kent County Council (KCC) elections will take place on 1 May, with residents voting for 81 councillors across 72 divisions.
Last time these seats were contested, in 2021, the Conservatives secured an overwhelming victory, with around 70% of the seats on the council.
In the past four years plenty has changed, so we went to Kent's county town of Maidstone to find out what is on the minds of some voters at the moment.
For most people we meet, the state of the roads is at the forefront of their minds including Briony Thompson, who has just passed her driving test.
""I'm a new driver, I just passed in January so potholes on the road are a big issue,"" she said.
But she added that it was not just a problem for drivers.
""I look after my nan who's in a wheelchair so even just potholes on the pavement when we take her down the street in the wheelchair, it's quite dangerous sometimes,"" she said.
""Sometimes her little wheels at the front go down a pothole and she jolts forward in the chair and you have to catch her.""
Briony wants to see councillors focusing resources on residential streets and walkways.
County councils are responsible for keeping libraries running.
Mother-of-two Bina Thapa said she could not live without them.
Her primary school age son is a keen reader, often getting through a book a day.
""We can't always afford to buy the books… I can't go every day to the bookshop, spending £8-£10 for a book,"" she said. ""That's not affordable for me.""
Bina said she would like to see her local library protected.
Joseph McCarthy, 20, would like to see councils make more money available through arts and culture funds.
""Music has been part of my life for a long time now and I've grown up with music but perhaps people now won't have the same resources that I was able to get,"" he said.
He is part of Maidstone Symphony Orchestra, which often performs at a local leisure centre.
""It's not a very grand venue,"" he said. ""You'd hope it would be quite nice, quite beautiful.
""Performing classical music in a sports hall is not brilliant, is it?""
He thinks public investment in this area could be beneficial for younger generations, too.
""Music allows young people to expand beyond what they think they're capable of,"" he added.
In past years some people have used their vote to send a message to politicians in Westminster, and issues outside the local council's remit can play a part in voting intentions.
Brian Jordan stopped to chat by the river in Maidstone. He's visiting from his home in Medway, where there aren't council elections this year.
But he said the biggest concern for him and his friends was the cost of living for pensioners.
""You've worked all your life and they put taxes on everything,"" he said.
""They put the pension up but I've had so many increases that that pension rise is just lost.
""Some are on the breadline.""
This is the first time that most of the seats on KCC will have been voted on since the last election in 2021.
At that time Boris Johnson was prime minister and the Conservatives were benefitting from a surge in support following the introduction of the Covid vaccine.
While the council has been Conservative-run since 1997, political experts say the current climate means the outcome is by no means pre-determined.
""The national political picture has changed quite dramatically, obviously the Conservatives are no longer in power,"" says Prof Richard Whitman from the University of Kent.
""The last time we had the KCC elections the Conservative party performed very strongly.
""The expectation this time is that other parties will challenge that, both at the level of Reform and the Labour party. But also the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and independent candidates who have performed strongly in the past.""
Voters in Kent will be asked to have their say on 1 May.

More than half of UK's butterfly species in long-term decline,"The destruction of habitats by humans is largely to blame, a conservationist warns.",2 Apr 2025,Dorset,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c230kzz73zmo,"More than half of the UK's butterfly species have populations in long-term decline, a survey has found.
The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme said that 31 of 59 species have had their numbers fall since 1976, when monitoring began.
It also found that 2024 was the fifth-worst year for butterfly numbers across the country, with all but eight species suffering declines on the previous year - though populations can fluctuate year-on-year in response to the weather.
Dr Richard Fox, head of science at Butterfly Conservation, which conducted the study, said the long-term decline was ""entirely down to the way we humans manage the landscape"".
While many butterfly species showed population declines last year, nine suffered their worst year on record - with the grizzled skipper, cryptic wood white and chalk hill blue seeing sharp drops compared to the previous year.
But 22 species were found to have suffered significant losses since monitoring began.
Among them was the small tortoiseshell butterfly, numbers of which plummeted by 86% in the past 49 years, while the green-veined white butterfly saw a 28% decline.
Common butterflies that live in gardens, parks and the countryside had their second-worst year in 2024. Only six species showed increases in their numbers since 2023.
Dr Fox said the falling butterfly numbers were due to ""destruction of wildlife-rich habitats"" by humans, as well as the use of pesticides and other pollutants.
Butterflies serve as an important indicator of the environment for humans, he added.
""When butterflies are in decline, we know that there are big problems with our environment,"" Dr Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Butterfly populations fluctuate annually in response to the weather. The study said that 2024's low numbers were partly due to a wet spring followed by a relatively cool summer.
But Dr Fox noted that climate change meant unusual weather was becoming more frequent.
""When we have poor weather, these already-depleted butterfly populations are highly vulnerable and can't bounce back like they once did,"" he said.
Dr Fox said the change was reversible and urged people to let their gardens grow wild and their grass long during the summer - as this increased the number and variety of butterflies.
The scheme asked volunteers to count butterflies across 3,552 sites in the UK."
